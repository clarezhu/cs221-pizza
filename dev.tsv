0	False	a	I've been applying to all the fast food restaurants (and other places too!) in my area but no offers so far. We have some food for the next couple days until payday but a pizza would help a lot. I can't offer anything besides my word that when I find a job I'll pizza someone too.   thank you! :)
1	False	a	I hope I did everything right. My deal is no better or worse than most people here. I live in a decent place with a room mate, both jobless at the moment and going to school. Both on food stamps. I have a 2 1/2 year old daughter that most of my EBT goes to, which is fine. Problem is both of our cards are empty but mine gets refilled in a week. I have exactly one cup of noodles left, half a bag of pork rhines, a full jug of apple juice and possibly 3 sandwiches worth of bread for peanut butter and jelly. Honestly, we don't eat much. If one of you was so kind as to offer even one pizza, it would be very appreciated. I'll take a picture, thank you, anything. Thanks for considering.
2	False	a	"We have three kids, two with autism, and one of them has been throwing a violent tantrum since about 8pm. Our townhouse is very small, and the other two kids can't be in their beds right now for safety reasons, so they're ""going to sleep"" in the rec room. Obviously they're still awake. I don't get paid until Thursday, and we could really use a pizza to make this less awful on the family."
3	False	a	Me and my roommate are broke till we get paid tomorrow at 2pm. got a empty fridge and no money. Plan to pay it forward. also willing to draw a picture of something you like(pizza0.o)
4	True	a	My girlfriend and I are moving out of a bad apartment and it has drained us financially. The work I do is going through a dry spell so I have not gotten paid in a month, and any funds I had left in my account have been put towards transferring services and paying first and last on a new place, as well as paying existing bills.  We haven't had much of a meal in around two weeks and our fridge is empty tonight. A pizza would really help and cheer me up! Thanks a lot for your consideration, RAOP.
5	False	a	Due to problems with work not paying me correctly or on time, I've fallen in a situation where all of my funds had to go towards my rent. I get a paycheque tomorrow but have zero funds until then, and not gonna lie I'm a little hungry! Heard about this subreddit and thought I'd give asking for internet help a try, and would love to return the favour this week as well! 
6	True	a	No real sob story here. Just your typical broke-after-paying-rent college student at UNT. Ramen and sandwiches until Thursday seems fairly unappetizing so I was hoping to get a good meal to last through the weekend.  I just discovered this sub and it's awesome. Definitely excited to be able to pay it forward after the money rolls back in...
7	True	a	I have nothing in particular to barter. I have no huge sob story. Im just a recexnt college's grad that is currently down on his luck. I am from Ft. Collins, CO and am a recent CSU graduate. Things are looking up for me. I passed the certification test to be a Pharmacy Technician so hopefully i can get a job soon. In the mean time, the generosity of a redditor is currently the only way im going to be able to eat today/.tomorrow. Thanks in advance regardless of the outcome of this.
8	False	a	I'm not sure how I would get a pizza. :( I live near McConnellsburg, Pa. and we have a few local places, but nobody that delivers. I could go pick it up, but I'm not sure how that would work.  It's the day before payday and I'd really like something other than bean and bacon soup for dinner.  I've given in the past and I'll give again this week if I can get some yummies tonight! :)
9	False	a	Hungry and would love some food but we're all broke and still working on homework. Any love for some Seattle students?
10	False	a	"I really hate to ask to ask because I'm such an independent person, but I got ""laid off"" (Problems with my boss, I won't get into it..) a few weeks ago and I've just been coasting on savings trying to find a new job. I'd be happy to entertain any requests or anything that could bring some happiness to someone's life as compensation for doing the same for me. "
