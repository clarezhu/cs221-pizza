0	False	a	My NCEA level three exams kick off next week and I am currently on study leave studying my ass off for them. Unfortunately the only food to eat at the moment is Sandwiches and I am sick as hell of them. I have no money to go and buy my own so I was hoping you guys would help out as a little pick me up. 
1	False	a	Short on cash untill I get paid Friday. Kids would love to have a meal they would acutally be excited by. Pantry is not bare, just very little, and not the most tasty things left. Can provide what ever proof asked. The help is appreciated. Sometimes bills leave me with out alot of cash left. 
2	False	a	Just got out of college for the summer, sleeping on a buddies couch because i wont have a bed/room untill wednesday. Neither him nor I have much money, would really appreciate.
3	False	a	no story straight to the point just had my last day of school and want to celebrate with pizza please! in the UK ♥
4	False	a	I have less than 2 dollars in each of my accounts right now.  The government of Kentucky takes out more money from me during the summer from my small stipend because I am not taking classes.  I still have to do my research/work.  I do not want to ask my parents for money as I'm 25 and I hate doing that.  I just saved some money on my car insurance but that doesn't come into effect until next month.  I'm barely getting by and have had about a coffee and a granola bar today.  Please someone save me!
5	False	a	I hope this really works.. I NEED something to go right today!! I am hoping to get a pizza for my family tonight. I got sent home early from work, spent most of the rest of the day  in doctor offices with my daughter, who still does not feel good..nor do they know whats wrong with her. She could really use some cheering up. Thank you for taking the time to read this... We are in Washington state.
6	False	a	Hello!  I'm in St-Ferreol-Les-Neiges, Quebec. I just feel like eating pizza. Unfortunately, I'm broke since I'm moving out soon. Also, I'm an unfortunate looking lesbian.   ;-)
7	False	a	I do have verification code btw!
8	False	a	I don't really have a sob story or anything. I paid my rent last weekend and have $7 left - I'm normally more prepared money-wise for The Post-Rent Week (TM), but wasn't so lucky this time. I planned for this by stocking up on Ramen and canned soup, but I had food poisoning over the weekend so I'd really love a real meal instead that I can likely spread out over 2-3 days. Cleaning a friend's apartment tomorrow night for cash so that'll get me through the rest of the week for gas and stuff.  Basic info, if it matters (first time requesting): 23, non-student, work full-time, live alone w/ 3 cats, obsessed with Harry Potter and mancala.
9	False	a	Okay, so I'm not exactly in the worst place seeing as I am living with my parents. But, due to circumstances with them, we've been in really tight money for about three years now. And we've been getting by food wise on food banks, and some meat (mostly chicken) on payday. It's looking up recently, but that doesn't change the fact that I haven't had any sort of pizza in a little over three years. So, it'd great to get some from one of you guys. Verification can be given when it's set up. 
10	False	a	Broke until Sunday, no food, no money, (all of what we did have went to our babies! [dogs, cat, snake...]) sitting at work and hungry as fuuuuh. We are broke as hell and craving some 'zaa. If someone would be kind enough to get us a pizza from Papa Johns or Dominos or Pizza Hut, (our favourites!!!) or anywhere really! we would be forever indebted to RAOP and on Sunday, when we get paid, we would totally pay back the favor to another in need!!! Thanks so much!! 
11	False	a	With some bills and what not I can't go shopping till I get paid Monday and I got no food in the house. Just a broke 20 year old wanting some pizza.
12	False	a	I've been stuck in the library all day working on a research proposal/paper/presentation. Finally home (library closed) and I have about 200-300 pages of research articles sitting in my lap and still a lot to do before tomorrow. Would love a pizza, not too picky.
13	False	a	Like the title says...my wife left me and I am unemployed. Life has not been kind to me lately. I was hoping reddit could help give me hope for humanity . Thanks guys...you're the best!
14	False	a	Graduating on April 28th, I love pizza.
15	False	a	We've spent the last three days playing n64 and watching movies because all of our friends left and it's freezing outside.
16	False	a	But I was pleasantly surprised to click on it, only to find such a cool subreddit! I looked through the posts- there are a lot of sad stories, and a lot of pizzas mending some rough situations. While I don't have any such problems in my life, I do love both pizza and kindness, and I would be *elated* to be on the receiving side of such a great combo!  Combo makes me think of pizza. Mmmmmm.  I live in Chicago, IL, right next to Clark and Division, visiting my girlfriend (my home is in the Bay Area of California). I don't do evil things, try my best to smile every day, love black olives, and want to give a warm thank you to everyone who reads this!
17	False	a	My boyfriend doesn't get paid until Thursday, we can happily repay someone or something after then. We have a package of Ramen for today, so I would prefer to have any donated food for tomorrow when we will have literally nothing, except 72 cents for cat food... because I'm not about to let her starve!  Anyway, I don't know much about these reddits but I thought I would give it a chance... I can message with you if you want. Also, it doesn't need to be pizza... we just want something to eat... but we don't have any gas in the car. Please help... Thank you for at least looking :)  EDIT: I can offer something, I can draw you a picture of anything you want, I can make you a necklace, take a photo, or any other artsy thing! =)
18	False	a	I don't know if anybody can help, with almost everyone on here being US based, but if you can, I would really appreciate it.  I'm starting to think if quitting and getting unemployment wouldn't be better (We have a good system in Ireland, terribly abused though).  I'm not fussy, anything at all really.  Edit: It's rolling towards 10pm here, so I'll just mention that when this post is more than 2-3 hours old it'll be ok until another time. No late delivery in my city, as far as I know. Cheers.
19	False	a	My girlfriends car broke down on the side of the road last night, and she spent the last of our money getting it towed 60 miles back home (Bellingham, WA.). This expense means she will now be unable to pay utilities or the car payment this month. The only reason she was down there was because we were not getting along, which was mostly my fault. I have no money but would like to give her a pick me up. Some za would probably do the trick. Any help would be appreciated.
20	False	a	I read an article about this website and can't believe you guys. I am a neuroscience student and prep cook and have been pretty down on my luck lately. I would love it if someone who isn't financially strained could help me out. I have less than twenty dollars to spend on food until the 15th if I plan on making rent. Considering moving out and camping in the woods for the rest of the summer. Fingers crossed.
21	False	a	For those of you so kind as to offer pizza for others, I ask that you perhaps consider sending a pizza to those at Occupy Wall Street. https://occupywallst.org/  If you click on DONATE it will take you to their donations page.  About halfway down you can donate a pizza to them.  I'll paste the instructions they provided here as well.  Order Us Food Liberatos pizza – order online – order the “Occu-pie” Please order vegan or non-meat pizzas  Other local business that deliver  Here is the link to Order Online http://www.seamless.com/food-delivery/Liberatos-Pizza-Parmigiana-New-York-City.2674.r
22	False	a	I think, finally, my roommate and I have hit rock bottom right before things start to look up, which always seems to be how it goes, doesn't it?  We have less than five dollars in the house, I maxed my credit card ages ago, and I won't be getting paid until next friday and god knows when he will as he hasn't even started his new job yet.   I'm so proud of how far we've come, starting the year more or less homeless to being able to afford a house and a dog until he lost his job. We managed to scrape together rent for this month, but I'd really rather not eat rice for the next seven days as that is literally all we have left in our cupboard aside from some baking essentials. Rice, waffles, and cake, diet of champions...  I would offer something in exchange but anything I can make costs more to ship than I will have for ages. If you want I can draw you something, I guess? Any help would be beyond appreciated and once he starts his job in a couple weeks, I will be sure to pay it forward!  
23	False	a	Welcome our 1st (and hopefully only *fingers crossed*) baby to Earth a week &amp; a half ago. Needless to say running on 1-3 hours of sleep a day and paying off doctor &amp; hospital has left us with very little money after essential bills have been paid. We're gaining a room mate next month which will free up money to reciprocate a pizza to a Redditor. Until then any thing helps!
24	False	a	Haven't had Papa John's in like two years after moving from Colorado to California. 
25	True	a	The title pretty much sums it up.   I've recently moved back to the States from Italy. All my household items are on a large ship on their way over which means I don't have much to use for cooking in way of utensils.   I'm not scrimping for pennies but I am being frugal till I figure out my means here (especially since I'm on the hunt for a job) so if the Pizza Fairy is waiting for someone truly in need then wait for another post!   
26	True	a	I work at an electronics store over here and I need something for lunch today and tomorrow. I have some change but I really don't feel like just eating cheez-its today haha. I plan on taking my lunch break at around 4 or 5pm. Then I would save the rest from today for lunch tomorrow and maybe Thursday. I promise to return the favor when I get paid this weekend to you or anyone else on here that needs some pizza in their lives :)
27	False	a	"No sob story here, no bullshit, I just want some pizza. If you aren't sure and you want to do something good then give your pizza to someone who ""needs"" it.   I'm just coming here to ask for a random act of pizza from a stranger.   I don't expect anything and definitely think that the people who really need food should be the main concern, but some pizza would cheer me up and I would really appreciate it."
28	False	a	Hey, I just got off work (11:37pm EST) and have tons of Lab reports to do and a quiz to study for in the morning. Also the paychecks at my work didn't go through this weekend, due to veteran's day on friday, so I wont get paid until tomorrow. I have no money and no time to prepare the scraps I have. Would greatly appreciate a pizza and can pay it forward once my check goes through tomorrow!
29	False	a	Hey everyone! So I am in the band Sleep City and we have been recording our new cd for a little while now. Before I went into the studio I didn't have a job so I had very little money for food. Right now I have eaten Ramen for the past week and I've had enough! If anyone could send me a pizza I will be forever grateful. Too much ramen intake makes Kevin a dull boy. PLEASE SAVE ME www.facebook.com/sleepcityrock
30	True	a	Hey,   So I'm currently on winter break, and  I've been waiting for a check from my parents since I've been unable to go home for the holidays. Unfortunately it didn't come today and now I'm broke, with literally no food. Literally none. I hope it comes in the mail tomorrow if so I promise to get someone a pie. I can take a picture of my fridge if need be.   If someone is able to do this I can also pay it forward tomorrow :). 
31	False	a	Hello there, I am a single parent who's been ravaged by this 5 day blackout here in Waukegan.  I've had to empty hundreds of dollars worth of food from my once cold refrigerator.  My kids are constantly asking for take-out however I cannot afford it.  I would be greatly appreciative of anyone who could help a family in need out.  We were ravaged by storms recently which have left us in a 5 day blackout as of yet.  I hope some redditer reads this and has sympathy for our situation.  Willing to provide pics of our empty fridge and our neighborhood in the morning when there is light to see the devastation.   I hope all is well with the community and wish everyone a good night. 
32	False	a	"I've been out of a job for 3 weeks. I've been doing random jobs in the neighborhood to help pay rent. I did land a new job. The only issue is it doesn't start until August (then 2 weeks til my first check). The last pizza I had was one of those Jack's (cardboard things).   Despite having several ""flavors"" Ramen Noodles are getting old. I don't know what else to say. I'm new to this.  Thanks for reading."
33	True	a	This is my first post here but basically I have lost my college ID, which is used to get into our dining halls. It costs 25 dollars to replace and I just don't have that money right now. I've been eating ramen since Saturday and would like some pizza as I wait for the 21st to arrive so I can get a replacement ID.
34	False	a	So I've got 5 exams over the next two weeks and a HUGE job interview next Monday that'll determine my financial state for the summer, and I'm hungry.  If I get the pizza and the job my first paycheck is gonna go towards paying it forward.
35	False	a	Oh my gosh I am starving and all i can think about is food right now. I've run out of food stamps and I've had pretty much the worst birthday ever today.   I haven't eaten anythingand the food closets don't have any distribution locations near any of my bus routes till the end of next week.   Can sent pic of ID as verification, but really I could use any kind of help :-\
36	False	a	Hey! Recently got laid off, and roommate gets paid Friday. Pretty much stuck on ramen at the moment... A pizza would be a blessing!
37	False	a	Requesting a pizza for a family of four in king george va to help celebrate our two kids doing so well and getting awards from school. I need a little help because I am not able to do so on my own.  If there is anyone who can help me, I would really appreciate it. Thanks for reading. 
38	False	a	Just found out about this subreddit, and I must say that this is a very honorable thing of redditors to do. Unfortunately for myself, I'm allergic to milk so a random act of pizza would do me no good. But if I were to make a request, a random act of wings would be interesting.
39	False	a	I can't say that I've seen this before, but the moderators of /r/nfl have done a fantastic job for a long time.  They've kept the peace, created a subreddit that has gotten nothing but compliments on how it looks (one of the Reddit Admins swung by to give compliments) and have given an incredible amount of time and energy into the community and updating it.  I'm not sure if their are any regulars over there, but if there are I'm sure you know what a great job these guys have done.  I think offering these guys a pizza would be a great way to show thanks.  http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/about/moderators  There is a list of moderators.  I know off the top of my head that /u/napoleonBonerparts has had a huge role in making the sub looking the way it does, but there are many others that have done a fantastic job.  /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza I ask of you fine people to offer these moderators a pizza.  If you're not sure who to send one to, just ask or send a message, I'm sure they'll gladly direct you to a deserving moderator.  Thanks for your time, and if this is unorthodox, well, it is Random, isn't it?
40	False	a	I have no money for food, and have to eat at a soup kitchen for dinner, was wondering if anyone could get me a pizza for my birthday.
41	True	a	I've been pretty discouraged this week in terms of finding employment, monetary problems, health issue and so on. I'm a bit too self conscious to really dig into it but if you need proof of my lack-of-funds, I'd be more than willing to provide that for you.  In this request, I hope for more than pizza but the kindness of a stranger to help me lift my spirits during my time of need by filling an empty belly. This is a hard time in my life but I'm hoping this request will help things turn around! :)
42	False	a	Anything in Madison, WI
43	False	a	At the start of the month my car broke down. I came back two days later and it was stolen. Cant afford a new one but saving my butt off. Work doesnt pay nearly enough and i have only a couple of pennies to my name till friday but im happy i have a job. Just got off work and only ate a pb j sandwich for lunch and im starving, but sick of living off ramen and pb j for a week. Any offer would be greatly appreciated.
44	True	a	"I'm a student and I'm a little low on cash for the next few days and would love a pizza right now. I promise to tell you at least one scientific fact about the physical world that makes you go ""No! That's not true"" even if it means I have to spend all night going through my stack of textbooks.  I spent all of my money doing [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/j7s3u/offer_anyone_need_anything_from_the_uk/). I was reimbursed via paypal but I stupidly made a transfer to my bank account so that money is lost in limbo for the next 2-3 working days.   I've just come across this subreddit and I will be buying at least one pizza next week for someone independent of the outcome of this request. What you guys do here is awesome! "
45	False	a	You're probably going to check out my previous posts. Go ahead. :)  
46	False	a	Hello Reddit,   I won't be getting any money until Wednesday and our fridge is bare. My wife and I would really appreciate a pizza if possible. I know others might need it more, but if possible we would really appreciate it. As soon as I land a job (2 prospects in the works) I would love to pay it forward of course. Anything to get a slice next to my name :P jk  Thanks Reddit and Redditors for all the laughs.   Edit:1 Thank you Gingaskunk! I will pay it forward as soon as I can!
47	False	a	As it says, I have no job.  My diet for the last few weeks has consisted of ramen, cheese, mayo, deli meat and bread.   I can give you the sob story if you want, but i'm not going to put it here. Basically unemployed for the last 2 months, and no money.  I have 2 interviews set up tomorrow, and hopefully one of those will pan out.    This is a throwaway due to the fact that friends use reddit and know me.  I have a lot of humility, and I never ask anyone for help. I can verify that I am in fact a redditor (13 mo) and will return this favor to some other deserving candidate when I get the job tomorrow (because i'm going to get it of course).  Thanks.
48	False	a	I've never done this, but I lost my job around February, right when I had to move to a more expensive place to live. I had to spend all of the money I had left on rent and I have been living on beans and rice for the last week and a pizza sounds really awesome! I'm getting ready for finals and almost moving home to a job. I will repay my pizza as soon as I get more money!
49	True	a	I'm a college grad living in NYC. Interning to keep my feet in the business, freelancing and dog walking when I'm not interning. The money I made this month is just enough to keep a roof over my head and my heat kept on.  I have no food, having eaten down what's left of my pantry over the course of the month. I've had nothing to eat but condiments for the last two days. I woke up this morning with a splitting headache and cramps in my feet. Anything you could give is appreciated! If this doesn't work, I'm going to try begging for food (not money) on the train.  I really don't want it to come to that...  **EDIT:** Thank you so much to @SallyMacLennane for gifting me with food today.  It was amazing and I will have left overs to last me through the weekend!  THANK YOU to everyone who upvoted and @m2mu for the soup kitchen advice!  Many best wishes this Thanksgiving!!
50	True	a	Hey RAOPers!  Yesterday was my undergraduate graduation where I earned my BS in Chemical Engineering and I am looking to celebrate with some pizza goodness.  I'm still looking for a job but as soon as I find one I am planning on paying it forward and purchasing a piled high pizza for a person in need (alliteration intended).  Thanks so much!  EDIT: /u/kgros004 was kind enough to offer me a pizza for this Thursday and I should be able to hold off my pizza cravings until then.  Thanks!
51	False	a	I'm a student doing summer classes in Farmville Virginia, I left for the weekend and forgot to shut my fridge all the way and everything went bad. A pizza would last me the rest of the week! :) 
52	False	a	Everyone has their sob story, so here's mine.   My boyfriend recently quit his job. He worked retail, and generally hated everything about it. He's wanted to be a programer for ages now and since he quit he's looking to actually do it. So, he's home all day and I'm the one working to support us. We recently applied to get SNAP assistance but haven't heard back yet.. So the fridge is getting empty to the point of silliness.  That being said, to add a little motivation i guess, If I manage to get a pie I'll build you a shrine  in my SMP Minecraft world. :D Will provide pictures as well to prove it all.  (Papa Johns is the only chain store that is in my area, but there's a ton of little mom and pop stores that offer like $5 pies)
53	True	a	Hello all. Having been laid off in March, the last few months have been lean for my partner and I, but I finally got a job today! I don't start until September so there are still plenty more nights of pasta and pulses, I just wondered if someone might be able to put a cheese-topping on what has been a long awaited good day and let us go to bed tonight fat and happy on Pizza? I'll pay it forward with my first paycheque and be eternally grateful. Many thanks to all of those wonderful people who make this subreddit a garden of kindness and hope. 
54	False	a	If you help me out, I promise to pay it forward when I get the chance! Thank you  EDIT: My friends came and got me! Enjoying Taco Bell. No need for Pizza today, I guess, but I'm sure I'll be back another day, perhaps with gifts!
55	False	a	Ive been eating nothing but rice and when im lucky ramen for almost 4 months now since being laid off from my computer repair gig. I live in Alaska where the economy and culture is about 4-5 years delayed from the rest of the US so the recession is only now starting to really take hold here, as such Ive been unable to find any regular work even at any of the typical franchised fast food joints. BUT I can make music, so if there is any kind of song you have ever wanted to hear or have made for yourself, a loved one, a personal project, or perhaps a video or web-series of yours; tell me about it and I will make it happen for a pizza. Preferably a pizza with meat on it, I literally have dreams of meat and cheese these days.   I can do electronic, hip-hop, blues, rock, doom metal, black metal, world/ethnic, orchestral pieces, 80s synth pop, ambient, almost anything really. If desired, I could sing a name, tagline, or slogan and do it jingle style or even use crazy robot voice effects. I could also mimic a specific artists style. [Here are some examples of my production.](https://soundcloud.com/metacitizen)  TLDR: Will music for food
56	True	a	I am super hungry and a pizza of any kind would feed me for days. When I get paid Friday I would love to return the favor. Please help a sister out!
57	False	a	Not sure if this will work, but we're a few film students that are rather hungry. There is no time to gather food, so we hope that a nice donor would be kind enough to send us a pizza. It would make our night so much nicer. 
58	True	a	Woke up 6 this morning puking. Haven't had any food all day, but now my appetite is coming back but I have no food. Anything would help and be greatly appreciated. 
59	False	a	but we have no one in our life here to offer to feed us tonight.  I would LOVE for you to feed us this night with your gift of the following: 1 large pepperoni and sausage pizza med crust for my- Hubby and Son I would like a medium veggie heavy on veggies pizza ...thin crust , extra sauce :)  you are interested in doing this ...we have a pizza hut and other pizza places in our area that are healthier....let me know how you want to do this Thank you and please know we will return the same energy next month to someone...we are it...us three...we have no one to grieve with or to feed us tonight on a night of sadness and grief to do this :) No scam...Let me know if you want to see the obit 
60	False	a	Cause Hungry, tired of noodles in a cup, and payday is friday.
61	True	a	so, i just moved to austin, texas to get out of freezing chicago. Got here a week ago with a little money to last me until I got a job. But........ I was riding my bicycle around to try to get to know the city when I crashed it.  As I lay there with a concussion and a dislocated shoulder, this asshole jammed his hand in my pockets to steal my cell phone and wallet. Then, to top it off, I watched this mother fucker ride away on my bike.  Was real shitty. Went to the hospital and got a sling. Hard to find a job with one of those. Just gave my last dollar away a couple nights ago. I'm really hitting rock bottom now. If anyone could get a pizza out to me, it would temporarily help me out. I am staying on a friends couch right now so I have an address.  I could also send a pic of the hospital report just so you know I am not bullshitting you.
62	True	a	Hey I just moved here to Sacramento starting a new job. I was supposed to get my paycheck last week but the damn thing must have gotten lost in the mail because there is no sign of it yet (not at old address either). Reaaaally hopin it would show up today since I've been without food since yesterday. Anyway, I fully plan on reciprocating once I get paid so It's more like a pizza loan. I don't know really too many people yet here in this town so I'm coming to you guys. Cheers!
63	False	a	Hi, information about the fire [here.](http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Morgan-Fire-Near-Mt-Diablo-Chars-1500-Acres-222950261.html)  I'll be stopping by the fire station myself later tonight and will be bringing homemade dishes... I'm thinking probably a few large casseroles or something easy to make in bulk. The thought crossed my mind that this seems like the sort of thing Reddit would love to help with.   Pizza donations can be sent to the ConFIRE Station #11 at 6500 Center St. in Clayton, CA. The firefighters have been working all day and night since the fire broke out yesterday, and I'm sure they'd appreciate some hot, cheesy slices of pizza!   To help you out, [here](http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=pizza&amp;find_loc=6500+Center+St.%2C+clayton%2C+ca&amp;ns=1&amp;ls=883fdc931eaafb15) is the Yelp page for pizza places near the address.   Hoping to be able to send at least 4-5 pizzas over there for dinner tonight. Let's make this happen! :)
64	False	a	Studying for physiology and anatomy -_- fuck my life.. honolulu
65	True	a	"I came across Reddit a few days ago and I hope that someone out there can help me surprise my family. My wife and I ended up losing our jobs, and things have been pretty hard for us. Last night I went without eating so that my children could eat. As a man, I feel like I'm failing my family and I'd like to give them a meal that isn't ""instant"". If anyone can make this happen, I will borrow my neighbors camera and make a video for you. Everyone will be home today at 5:00 PM EST. We are in Plainfield, New Jersey."
66	False	a	"Trying to get a job. I've been submitting resumes and going to job fairs. I'm so close to getting one however I am broke and have nothing to eat. My dog ran out of food so she's going on a little ""fast"" too. It would be a blessing if someone lent a helping hand of pizza. Also I am an artist and would love to sketch up something if you help out.( or whatever you want me to sketch)  "
67	False	a	im in philly area, 19128   THANKS!
68	False	a	**Note:** I did post this in the other random act of pizza subreddit first not realizing this was the main one. I have not recieved pizza (or even a comment) there.   Hey, thanks for taking the time to read this. I got injured really badly last pay period and was unable to work for nearly two weeks. Normally I would have a back up plan but I just spent a whole bunch of money on a move out of state so that I could finally get my life heading the direction I needed. I have 7 dollars in my checking account and nothing in my savings. I have a six pack of ramen noodles and half an onion and that is every thing that I own as far as food. I have already been surviving off ramen and toast for the last 3 days. Please help me out. I promise to pay it forward as soon as I am able. I can try and draw you something but my art skills are pretty lacking. I cant think of anything else to barter with if you think of something let me know. Again, thank you for taking the time to read this.  **Edit:** Crap! I realized I didnt add where I am from WA, USA
69	False	a	for a week and a half now I've been surviving off of an egg a day, I just heard of this miraculous community service today, and ask some wealthy aristocrat to spare a few cents and allow me the delicious mouth party of one Pizzaville pizza, in my opinion the best pizza in Toronto.  Much love and respect Hungry editor Worldmind.
70	True	a	Any will do, we're all just so hungry. I heard about RAOP from the Culture of Reddit video, and this part touched me big time. Hoping to see if Reddit will help us out- we're sure to return the favor when we get some money. 
71	False	a	Long time reader, first time poster.  Forgive me if there's a better place for this, but I thought I'd try here.  I'm a divorced dad with limited funds.  The ex is remarried and in a better financial place.  Not trying to compete with her, but I hate always telling the kids we can't go out to eat.  I have $60 in Fandango cash that I basically have nothing to do with right now.  The kids and I have seen what we're going to see until the summer, and I figured maybe I could trade it for a gift card somewhere.  As I said, I've followed this site for a long time, but I've always been too proud to ask for help.  This way I figure I'm not taking a handout.  What I'm hoping is to get 2 $25 gift cards, and I would give $30 in movie cash for each one.  If you're not familiar with Fandango cash, you can use it at any theater that accepts fandango, and it never expires.  You can look on Fandango.com for more info.    I know there are a lot of great people on here, and I'm hoping some of them would enjoy going to the movies :)  Have a great day!
72	False	a	I'm about to leave my newlywed wife for 3 weeks to go train in the desert and would love to share a pizza and watch a movie with her the night before I have to leave!
73	False	a	Hey guys, my buddy and I have contracted a severe case of cashlessness.  We just paid rent, and will have no money until we recieve our scholarship checks.  We'll make sure to pay it forward!
74	False	a	I go to school in Mississippi and haven't had a vegetable in 5 days. Pizza is a vegetable now, right?  Edit: I will get a vegetable pizza and provide pictures to verify pizza's veggie goodness. I think this is a big step for America.  Edit2: Some upvotes but no offers yet. I will also post pics of me SHARING my veggie pizza with a close friend of mine, who is a vegetarian. One large pizza should do the trick between the two of us, so a $15 eGift card or something would work just fine. Also I have paypal linked to my reddit email.  Edit3: Actually, I just won the college drawdown from BOTW. So please don't bother actually sending me anything now :) Much thanks to him for feeding a hungry college student. 
75	True	a	  Just looking to add a little food to the fridge in the form of leftovers.  I deleted a request because I requested a few times over a few days, unsuccessfully.  I should have planned for this, but I didnt and now I dont know where to turn for help.  I am in the process of finding assistance from an agency of some sort. I have never been in this position before, I am trying to adjust as best I can.
76	True	a	It's just me tonight.. my kiddos are gone for the night and i would really like to enjoy a pizza i haven't been on in awhile due to very rude people so i'm just asking if you are not gonna say anything nice and you only want to talk negative then pass this up and don't post because you are wasting your time being negative. no sob story or nothing just hungry with a night to myself. thanks RAOP!! :)
77	True	a	all of my money is going to bills, ramen, and food for my dog, hell, he's eating better than me most likely.
78	False	a	Hey guys, im very hungry. i havent eaten all day, and have been hungry the psat few weeks since i lost my job. Im 18 and my parents live four states away. I live in a townhouse with 5 other guys and seeing them all bring their thanksgiving leftovers home really sucked, as i spent it by myself eating what was left of my canned soup. Today has been the breaking point where i have to ask, im starving:(
79	False	a	Would really enjoy some pizza just not in the budget. Thank you
80	False	a	i am a 26 yr old house wife and mother. My family and I have been eating Ramen Nooodles and PB&amp;J sandwiches for the past week and the food stamps dont come in for another 4 days. I would like my family especially my 2 yr old son to have something a little more tasteful to eat.
81	False	a	It's my nephews birthday and we're having a family get together! The baby boy truly loves pizza! My uncle doesn't believe the karma wielding abilities of the reddit communities. Would be nice if somebody can prove him wrong. PM for address?
82	True	a	College student, Just had out-patient surgery for moles that are being tested for carcinoma/melanoma. The Copay was more than I anticipated and have $16 in the bank left over (I can send verification of this, if requested). A Pizza would be great to help beat the pain that's starting to set in.   PapaJohns is my go to pizza place  Edit* Here I am all bandaged up! http://i.imgur.com/NeveQg8.jpg http://i.imgur.com/aiueFN2.jpg http://i.imgur.com/2whllQS.jpg 
83	False	a	time for giving but gave to much now im broke myself: I recently had bought toys to give away at toys for tots anad it comes down to it i spent over 100 dollars i had left anticipating of getting paid today and guess w hat happens, I go in and lose my job becuase of labor cuts. PLEASE help me feed my siblings tonight sincelry your dear redditor  PS will send pic with pizza and siblings
84	True	a	Er, so yeah.  I'm feeling a little peckish and could really use some brain food to help keep me up tonight.  I believe the dominos where I live is open until midnight.  I'm on the east coast.  [How much money I have.](http://i.imgur.com/VYlTr.jpg)  I get paid at the end of the week and will most definitely pay it forward!  Edit:  Thanks so much to Bioraiku for helping me out!  Expect me to be here with an [Offer] tag come payday. :]
85	False	a	Some help please? I do have more ramen and pasta. Just want a delectable pie instead with a twist on the process.  I have been here before and have made requests. My one caveat is that I can pay the willing giver back with a pizza when I get paid. In this case it will be this Friday.  However this time I want to do something different. I want to either pay it forward to a person of the givers choice with an included explanation as to why the person deserves a pie, or by giving me an explanation as to why you have decided to give to me a pie.  I want to do it this way to provide some entertainment for the sub, and so this doesn't look like just another desperate request. I look forward to your stories and reasoning.
86	False	a	This last couple months have been hard for me and my grandpa, early in June my grandma passed away and although we've been managing to get by but it hasn't been easy. Other than when the occasional family member brings over some food we've mostly been living off ramen and sandwich meats until one of us can find a job. (Previously we stayed home because of my grandma and our funds came through her from the state)  Could really just use a pizza to boost morale for me and my grandpa.  
87	True	a	Tonight's one of those nights where my boyfriend and I are in a mighty funk about our bank account balance. I'm offering some artwork [in exchange for cheesy delight](http://imgur.com/a/u5lWD#0). If there's one-- maybe two-- items you'd like, reply or PM me. I can also make you a similar commission item. I do most things, as you can see there...  [plus My Little Pony...if you happen to be into that kind of thing.](http://fillyphalanx.tumblr.com/)
88	False	a	http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPizza/comments/x1c26/request_negative_in_the_bank_and_got_nothin/ Posted here too, Ive been lurking for a bit on Reddit but guess I dont have it down as much as I thought haha. It's such a big place!! 
89	False	a	Ive got that pizza craving again, please help my suffering.   NOODZ FOR PIZZA XD JK
90	False	a	My awesome Mother In Law always cooks extensive meals for the whole family and I would like to extend some kindness her way. Problem is we're too broke to buy.  Any Takers?
91	False	a	We all know that period between student loans when you're stretching every penny you have. Unfortunately for me my housemates decided to shaft me by all buying stuff just before bills, meaning i was the only one with the money to pay them this month. This has left me with just enough to cover rent until the loan comes in later this month, but until then, and until I can get the money back from housemates, I'm a little on the food-light side of life.  Any pizza would be much appreciated &lt;3
92	False	a	 I am about to move to a new apartment, and my girlfriend and I have a need for pizza pie to give us the energy to go. I have no artistic talent or anything to give you in return. How about I make an ms paint picture as a thank you for your good deed (my skills are bad so this should be funny).
93	True	a	"I certainly don't want to take advantage of anyone's generosity, but I'm so tired of ""White Chicken Lean Pockets"" and ""Pepperoni Pizza Lean Pockets""... If anyone's feeling especially generous, I promise I'll pay it forward as soon as I have the ability to. Pizza would totally make my evening.  PM me for details?  Thanks for helping a hungry guy."
94	True	a	Hey RAOP'rs!  I lost my job about a month ago, and luckily I found a new one right away.  However, it was a $1/hour paycut AND I only get half the hours I used to get.  I had to use my entire first paycheck to pay utilities, phone bill, and the money I owed on my (store) credit card (good credit &gt; fun things).    I (luckily) have a pantry full of pasta (I decided that $10/10 boxes of pasta was a good idea a few months ago and that's a lot of pasta) and a few cans of beans and half of a 5lb bag of rice, as well as sauces and syrups for those guys.  I also have a lot of baking things.  I'm definitely not short on food, but it's getting a bit monotonous eating only this, especially since I have to do it 'till next Thursday.  I only have $16 until next Friday's paycheck and I'd like to spice up my life with a treat this weekend!  I live in Minneapolis and I'm in the delivery area of Pizza Hut, Papa John's, Domino's, and a local favorite (though much more expensive), Pizza Luce.  If anyone's willing to order me a medium cheese or pepperoni pizza for carryout or delivery (I can pay tip with the $2 I found on my way home yesterday if it's delivery, or I can bus/bike to pick up from any of those locations!) I would love you forever!  I don't owe rent next month (because I had to pay the last month of rent when I signed my lease) so I will be passing it on as soon as I get my paycheck!  Thanks so much!
95	False	a	Anyone can help me out? I'm broke currently and I would get you reddit gold or pizza tommorrow with my tips.
96	False	a	Look, we're not starving, but we all forgot/don't have our credit cards with us and could use a nice pie. Some help would be nice. Here's some bullshit reasons why we really deserve it though:  -We're in a band.  -We just watched The Big Lebowski.  -We have a dog named Cooper.   [Here's us three](http://i.imgur.com/qhdt2.jpg) looking super content with our middle-class living conditions (I'm the sorta black dude).  We probably aren't as qualified as other unfortunate subscribers here, though this IS *random* acts of pizza anyway! I also can't really promise this since I'm just another internet citizen, but if someone gives us pizza, I'll make sure to pay it forward soon when my new credit card comes in.  Even if we get nothing and are downvoted to hell, props to this wonderful community and like I said, I look forward to being a contribution some time soon.  Oh!, and here's Sergio [looking sexy as fuck](http://i.imgur.com/TaikH.jpg).
97	False	a	As the title says, Broke. In college. And Hungry. I need to change it up from the dining hall. I would be grateful and once I can, will pass it down!thanks =D
98	False	a	My kids are home for the summer, and I have NOTHING good to cook tonight. Payday is a few days away and (despite my epic culinary skills) I can't muster up anything tasty. Last night I tried to make a spicy noodle dish with broccoli that caused the kids not speak to me for the rest of the evening. Please help me reclaim my position as a cool mom. The kids have different tastes, but a nice pepperoni pizza would do the trick. Thank you for considering me and the little ones. 
99	False	a	My friend tore her leg muscles and cant really walk that much at the moment she doesnt have much to eat at her gmas and would really love a pizza I told her i might be able to get her one please and thank you from her and I. Also in Illinois I missed that in the title first post here sorry
100	False	a	Doctor prescribed me Ambien and I decided to take a tumble into a DVD rack in my sleep. Broke and could use some comfort food. Image below.  http://i.imgur.com/iNPTIz0.jpg
101	False	a	Hey Reddit! This is my first post ever on here. I've been a lurker for almost a year now but I'm not much of a talker in general. I have two girls 6 and 9. I support them on my own and make sure they have everything they need. Here's the issue. [Paypal is holding all my cash](http://i.imgur.com/HeyOJ.jpg), as per usual. I wasn't expecting it to be held this long. However I'm almost 100% positive it will be released Monday or Tuesday. If someone could help out me out, I can send you $5 now and the rest once it is released. Tonight we are fine but tomorrow we will have nothing left. My mother is coming down Sunday to lend me some groceries until the money get's transferred to my bank account. I can give you any information needed. I'm not asking for handouts, I will pay it back. 
102	True	a	"(A bit of background: I broke my foot in May and since I lived alone at the time and was unable to use the 3 flights of stairs to my apartment, I moved back in with my mum for assisted living, basically--until I can get back on my feet. **I'm still in a effing cast! UGH!**)  ANYWHO, we're leaving this evening to visit my grandma 12 hours away and mum's still running around trying to get everything ready for our trip and as much as she can for when I return home, seven days ahead of her. I'm trying to help where I can, but there isn't much I can do with a broken foot. Having a RAoP delivered (I broke my driving foot) would accomplish a number of things: **1.)**Resolve the issue for the last meal in town. **2.)**Not dirty any dishes for her to wash.  **3.)**Be a way I can ""help""/show my appreciation. It's something nice for her and she totally deserves it.  We live in Tennessee and I would be happy to answer any and all questions anyone asked. :)  **EDIT** Request fulfilled!!!! mayquiri rocks my socks!  http://imgur.com/BOjTu"
103	False	a	I'm having a hard time building up strength to even post this. I feel so weak, I haven't ate in 3 days, haven't slept, haven't worked.. I'm just so gone.  4AM Thursday morning I hear a big thump and then I hear the lady down stairs screaming in the hallway... Her husband fell in the shower I'm not sure if he had a stroke or what exactly happen, as she dialed 911 I held him in my arms and he stopped breathing. I tried to do everything I could to bring him back. I'm in shock and so sad, it's just unreal. I feel bad for the man and the lady.. I'm so depressed over the situation.   I live out in the country a bit, and I'm just too depressed to go anywhere or do anything.. I plan on trying to go see a therapist tomorrow (if ones open) and head back to work Monday.   I think it would be great if someone could order me a pizza and me snuggle up with my journal tonight and possibly watch a movie to help ease my mind.....I really don't feel comfortable driving, I just need to relax and do some coping skills.
104	False	a	Hey guys, i feel really strange asking for food, because usually, I'm the person giving others food. But recently, I've came into some trouble, and now I can't even afford to feed myself.  I would really appreciate it if someone could feed me , thanks 
105	True	a	Howdy, I seem to be in a predicament. I have bronchitis,  and I can't get out of bed. I spent all my money getting antibiotics and an inhaler. All I really need is a pizza. I think I just coughed up a good piece of my lung. Oh well. But really, I'll love you forever. I believe in paying it forward, so I think I'm done rambling. 
106	False	a	Hi there awesome redditors!  I'm in need of food :(   I have been living off mcdoubles since the 25th of last month when my rental company forced us out of our rental 5 days early. Ramen and eggs are getting old, as well as dollar cheeseburgers.   I would love a pizza to thank a dear friend of mine for the $20 loan to pay my virgin mobile bill, paying him back tomorrow after selling plasma. Would be awesome to share.   I could repay you in house cleaning if your in the area, or if you need a personal chef for a night, I have references! Or I can draw you some awesomely cheesy artwork since I won't have cash to pay you back.  This is my first time posting in this sub, saw all the kindness and was really touched. Faith in humanity can rest easy on this sub's shoulders.   Sorry for rambling, just remembered this sub and thought it was worth a shot! Here's to hoping! Have a fantastic day :3 
107	False	a	Not a dire situation, really, but there are certain times when a pie would hit the spot. This is one of those times. Thanks.
108	False	a	I have a stuffed up nose and I'm cocooned in a blanket on the couch. I'm really hungry and really broke, I don't get paid till next Friday and help would be greatly appreciated. 
109	False	a	Hi, I lost my job last month. Currently out of food, cash and would love a pizza to grind on if anyone is up to helping a dude out. Thanks!
110	True	a	Oahu, HI. EBT maxed, broke. tired of PB&amp;Js. Will return the favor in 4 days if needed.
111	False	a	I'm hiding behind this throwaway account because I am embarrassed to ask for help again. We've received pizza before when we were homeless a couple months back. However we moved recently in our new apartment and were already late on rent so all our money went towards bills. My father is lending us gas money tomorrow to get to the food pantry but today I'm not sure what we are going to do.   My husbands father is staying a couple weeks with us because he wasn't getting the proper care where he lives at. He has heart problems and is diabetic, and he has to eat which makes me feel terrible because we had to pay a more big of a late fee then I thought and I feel that we are letting him down by us as well not giving him the proper care he needs.     We have no children so I can understand if we aren't helped.  However, if someone does help, I can give them my real account name, and I wouldn't mind taking a picture as well, whatever works.  Thanks. 
112	False	a	Homeless man is a friend who just got kicked out of his house after getting out of rehab (kid has had a really rough year) and my roommates and I don't get paid till tomorrow and we have no food to eat tonight. This is my first post here so not sure what else I'm supposed to say, but if someone could help us out we would be extremely appreciative! Thanks!
113	False	a	I have no money and i don't work (Still underage) and my parents are on vacation and my brother is out and forgot to leave me money for food. A small box of pizza would be appreciated. Please and thank you kind Reddit community. :)
114	True	a	hey guys! my friend and i are probably going to be up all night working on the final papers for our summer class and we'd love a study break. we're both the first people in our families to go to college (our parents are all immigrants) and we're at an Ivy League university on very, very generous financial aid. help us out, school is hard. ease our pain with pizza!
115	False	a	Hey everyone! The title pretty much says it all....I'm totally craving a pizza and can't afford one right now :( If some generous, pizza loving Redditor would like to get me one to last until my payday, which is Saturday, I would really appreciate it.  I will pay it forward when I have the means. Thanks!
116	True	a	Hi. My girlfriend told me about Reddit and random acts of pizza. I still can't believe there is people this generous out there. I need a hand with the food for my daughter's birthday party. I am a single mom of 3 kids, ages 6 months, 3 years, and 7 years. I am throwing a small party this Saturday, Oct 29th and my daughter requested pizza for supper and I'm not sure I can afford pizza for all her guests (10 girls) I would appreciate any help offered! Verification can be provided.
117	False	a	No sob story here, Just want to celebrate my birthday. I'm all alone and don't feel like cooking just for myself. :)
118	False	a	Once I'm stable again in a couple of paychecks (4-6 weeks! :( ) I plan to reciprocate.
119	False	a	The title pretty much says it all.  I'm dirt poor at this point, trying to find any sort of job, be it part time or just a day laborer, I'll do anything just to have a couple bucks to rub together.  I'm starving, depressed, and love the Reddit community, so if anyone has it in their heart today to help out a beaten down man, I'd be ever grateful.  Thanks
120	False	a	I can provide proof by way of drivers license picture and bank account screenshot by PM.  Using a throwaway because I go to meetups and I don't want people to go in my comment history and know me as the guy without money or friends.  
121	False	a	Looking for someone to shout dinner tonight. Wife is 35 weeks pregnant and I'll be home too late to cook. Wanna shout our unborn child some random pizza goodness? I'm in Australia!  Edit: spelling (must be getting hungry!)
122	True	a	I'm just feeling really down right now, and a pizza would help loads. Long story short: I'm a graduate student making not so much a year. Last month, I picked up an abandoned dog in the middle of a parking lot. Wasn't financially prepared to get a dog, she just kind of wandered into my life. Ended up bringing her home, getting her spayed and up to date on shots. Turns out she's heartworm positive, but the love of my life right now. Between vet bills and paying my pet deposit ($400...ugh), I realized today I have $404 in my account to last me until the end of the month, and bills haven't been paid yet. I was sitting there thinking about what I have in my pantry and what kind of meals I can make without grocery shopping for the rest of the month so I can still provide for my dog as well.   As I was coming home and turning into my neighborhood, a truck ran a stop sign and hit my car. I had to wait 45 minutes out in the sun waiting for the cops to get there/report to get written up. Come home, and to top everything off, my dog had peed on the carpet.  It's my birthday next week, but I'm stressed about finances, school, getting my dog up and healthy, and now on top of it, getting my damned car fixed.   I've bought pizza before, and never thought I'd be on the asking end, but I can't think of anything right now that would make me feel just a little bit better. I will definitely be re-paying it back in the future. Just for now I'm in a bit of a bind.   Willing to offer you any proof...I just need a reason to smile right now.   EDIT: Got a pizza from thenewblueblood. Thank you!! http://imgur.com/DYEkJ
123	False	a	Hey RAoP, I had court today.  I got my second minor about a week ago and I feel like shit.  I had court, and the judge ordered me 500 dollars in fines and 40 hours community service.  I'm a pretty good kid, but I like to party and drink, and I got pulled over biking home from a party.  I'm living in a house, I'm a sophomore @ NDSU. I don't feel like cooking anything.  Been cruising Reddit for about 5 hours now.  Oh yeah, missed a calc quiz and my TA won't let me reschedule, she said that court wasn't an acceptable excuse. So I'm starting Calc 1 with a zero.  Thanks guys.  EDIT: Fargo
124	False	a	I have been stuck inside my room all day because I had a huge, blow-out fight with my roommate and I don't want to see him. I have no food here and also no money, and can't leave because I have nowhere to go and there is a thunderstorm outside. I have received a pizza before, a couple months ago, and also given one in /r/Food_Pantry. I have $6.30 in PayPal also if someone would like to trade. Thanks for reading!
125	False	a	Got a few friends coming by tonight to watch the PPV we're all broke as s**t, and would like some pizza to fuel us through the night. (We're in the UK so the PPV is on at like 1am till 4am)
126	False	a	Until my student loan comes through on monday/tuesday (I've been assured) I basically have nothing to eat. Friends have been cooking me dinner every night this week, but I thought maybe reddit might buy me lunch today. I've never done this before, not exactly sure how it works.
127	False	a	Hey recently moved downtown, but still working in sandy springs so I am spending all of my money on gas.  I don't get paid until wednesday and would love some pizza.  I will definitely pass on the love once I get my check!
128	True	a	I've spent the last three days fixing my car, and in the process had to spend all of my money in parts and it's still not fixed yet :(  I've had nothing but bread (no peanut butter or jelly :() the last two days (it was time to go grocery shopping right before car broke down.) I have tried everything to get borrow money from friends, but being college students they couldn't do much.  If someone could send me a pizza that would be awesome, I'd so appreciate it, it'd last last me three days too! I'll pay it forward Friday!
129	False	a	My husband is an ice cream man making 25% commission. I'm currently jobless waiting to hear back from a temp service. My husband works his ass off for free pretty much, because he cannot find a job not even through the three temp services in our area. When he first started this job he was making amazing money. But things slowed down extremely. He went from bringing home $100-$200 a night to $15 or less a day. He also has to pay for gas which is $15 a day. So as you can see he's not making money at all right now.     The only reason why he is staying with this job, is because the owner is making him co-owner next year and also letting him stock vending machines so he'll be making two salaries. So my husband is trying to keep whats best for our future in mind.    However I'm in starvation mode, I've lost 4 pounds in one week due to not eating. I've been snacking around the pieces of moldy bread, hoping for my husband to have a good day and hoping I hear back from the temp service that is suppose to be contacting me back.. I just called my husband and he's only at $60 (he makes 25% of that, which will be used for gas ) and he's going to be heading back to the shop in 20 minutes. So it's another bad day. My stomach is killing me. It would mean everything if someone could help out.      I'm posting from an alternative account because I communicate with far away friends and I don't really want people to know how much we're failing right now. I wont hesitate to give proof, My username, pictures of my cabinets and refrigerator, Facebook name, etc. I'm just extremely hungry, it feels like everything is just crashing down and it sucks.
130	False	a	Im craving pizza really bad, and i dont have enough money to buy one. Love it if any can donate me one! Thanks.
131	False	a	I was really hoping to not have to do this... but I lost the work study job I've had for a year just a week after coming back to school about a month ago, and haven't found one to replace it yet. So I have no money, and on top of that, used my last meal swipe for the week last night at the cafeteria. I don't get to use next week's swipes until Monday, and I currently don't have any other source for food. A gift card for just one pizza would get me through the rest of the weekend, and once I find another job, I'll pay it forward to someone else in need. Really appreciate any help. Thank you!
132	False	a	My SO is 32, has multiple sclerosis and is on disability. He went out of state to get a controversial surgery that's suppose to help his symptoms. It was paid all out of pocket by him and his parents. He's going to be home in a couple hours and I'd love to surprise him with pizza since he has been through so much stress these past few days. (And we are broke until the 1st) I can at the very least prove the MS/on disability parts if you would like. This would mean so much! Thanks in advance!  *Edit for spelling.
133	False	a	Me and my girlfriend have run out of food and the only money we have left is for our train tickets home tomorrow. We'll return a pizza back to community when we have christmas money!  http://i.imgur.com/1JUds.jpg
134	True	a	My girlfriend and I are moving out of a bad apartment and it has drained us financially. The work I do is going through a dry spell so I have not gotten paid in a month, and any funds I had left in my account have been put towards transferring services and paying first and last on a new place, as well as paying existing bills.  We haven't had much of a meal in around two weeks and our fridge is empty tonight. A pizza would really help and cheer me up! Thanks a lot for your consideration, RAOP.
135	False	a	Any type would be appriciated im not picky whatsoever thanks
136	False	a	Like the title says, it has been a rough month and my husband and I are a little short til payday. If anyone is willing to do this we would be  SO grateful and can pay it back on 11/5. Thanks for looking!
137	False	a	We're a family of 6 and we're completely broke. Money wise and food wise. We wanted a pizza for dinner tonight, but like I said, we're broke. Can you help us out? We appreciate it!
138	False	a	My girlfriend and I moved out to Longmont, Colorado just under a month ago primarily for school and while my work transfered me (Starbucks), the lack of hours while moving in combination with other factors has left us with nothing but cornbread until Monday. My girlfriend has gone to the coffee shop to apply for scholarships in peace and I would love to be able to fill her tummy with surprise pizza upon her return. I promise to pay it forward.
139	False	a	Hey all, Im just sitting at home alone... really wanting to treat myself to something yummy to help me get in the working mode for all this stuff I have to do before work tomorrow but I'm utterly broke until payday this week :/ I'd love some help. Thanks so much! 
140	False	a	I have a girl over and there's no food to feed her with, but there's a Pizza Nova downstairs. If you could order a pizza and leave it under whatever name you choose, I'll go grab it.   Thank you guys!  Here's the store information:  (416) 439-0000  5585 Yonge Street, Toronto, ON M2N 5S4  
141	False	a	"I in no way actually expect anyone to be kind enough to do this for me, but I thought I'd give it a shot.  I'll provide some back story just so that I don't come off as a mooch. Currently sitting at home alone for the weekend, family is over 3 hours away, and my girlfriend... (or whatever she is to me after the falling out we've had over the past 2 months) is headed out for the weekend to go camping with her bestfriend. We're working on our relationship and part of that involved me moving out on my own so I could focus on myself, find a job, and seek help for my severe depression, until I've made progress towards getting my shit together she's not willing to say we're in a relationship more serious than ""seeing each other"" Sounds harsh, but really it's just because she wants me to prove that I'm actually going to get my shit together.  Today is one of those days where I've slumped into a depressed state, not nearly as bad as some days, but I've made progress and will continue to strive for progress. I guess my hope is that someone will be kind enough to make my day, so that when I've got my shit together I can do the same for someone that was once in my position.  Anyways before I turn this into a book with my rambling... TL;DR- Broke, Lonely, Depressed, and really hungry (I've lost 15 lbs in the past 2 weeks... =( )  "
142	False	a	This week has been hectic and very trying. I realize I'm new but I've actually been here a while. Anyway My sister and her children will be here to stay with us in about 2 hours. She is coming from a long way and is leaving a domestic violence situation. She wasn't supposed to be here until the weekend but is coming in today. If she had come saturday like she was supposed to I would have had more time but now I have nothing to feed them and they have been driving 25 hours. I can pay it forward but not til monday or tuesday. I already fed mine so were good but help to feed them would be very much appreciated. If you can help please let me know and ask what you need. Thank you
143	False	a	Every day we eat peanut butter sandwiches, cheapest of the cheap hot dogs, ramen noodles or rice. We are currently about to walk (no car --long story of bad luck) over two miles in 95 degree weather to overdraft our $8 balance bank account in order to buy food for the week. I'm the last person who would ever ask for anything, and perhaps that is why we have lived in such rough shape for so long, but I figured I would give it a shot. Maybe it will delay another day and something will come along. Thanks in advance for helping us, or for any who considered..  UPDATE: People are amazing. We have had some wonderful people offer us assistance. Thank you to those who have helped and those who have offered. We received a Random act of Dominos from the one and only flamingcow. We also will be receiving a grocery gift card soon from another wonderful person. Again, we're taken back by the generosity. We're not used to receiving such gifts. There are amazingly good people out there.  P.S. - I can only hope that we can be as generous to others once things have turned around for us.  MORE EDITS: Wow people have been generous to us, we just got another gift of Pizza Hut today completely unexpected! Thank you very much! (I'm not sure if they want to be named publicly so I won't do so unless I have their permission). We can't wait to be good enough financially to be able to give the gift of pizza/food to others in need in the future!
144	False	a	I live in Minnesota and its -40 today with the windchill and they made us go to school. Me and my friend would really enjoy a pizza. My friends username is sparklebear3000.
145	False	a	I have a 7 year old son named Isaac and we dont have anything to eat until friday when i get my check. We only a tiny thing of old leftovers in the fridge right now, just trying to make it a couple more days. If anyone could help us out til then I'd be so happy to pay it forward in 2 days, thank you all so much! 
146	False	a	I'm a community college student who hasn't had a decent meal in quite some time. I've been eating two or three eggs a day all semester. (the cheapest food really, 2 1/2 dozen for about $4 at my local salvage grocery, that's about 15 cents an egg! Way cheaper and more nutritious than Ramen Noodles!) But I've only two left and after that its a cold water diet until my next paycheck in a week, which is mostly going towards rent and gas. (may have to sell this computer)  I know there are others around the world who are more in need but goodness I sure would love some pizza. As a younger kid, I took good food for granted now it has become a priority and I feel foolish for my prior attitude. If nothing else I would love some words of encouragement or anything that's ever helped you when times got tough. And, if it means anything, I will make a promise to do two Random Acts of Pizza whenever it is a little more plausible.  A big thanks to this subreddit, you guys are a real honor to the internet and the power of kindness! Keep up the good work and if you can't help me please do it for someone else as I know you will! :)
147	False	a	I only have a pizza hut nearby plus some local places that are much more expensive.  What I'm programming? An Escape game in Java, think myst but without having to keep a notebook of all the riddles.  EDIT: 50 tries on that pizza hut game and nothing. :(
148	True	a	thanks in advance guys! 
149	True	a	HR somehow managed to stuff up my pay this week, and was unable to purchase any groceries at least until monday.  This might sound like a sob story, but I literally have nothing to feed my kids tonight.  Will provide photos for proof if needed. 
150	True	a	So it's that time of the term again when everyone's student loan has run out...except...unlike most students, I can't go home either because I have an 8000 word dissertation to write :’(. Please pitty me and feed me, pleeeaassee? 
151	False	a	Title says it all, ha. Being sick just really sucks, but pizza for dinner sounds fantastic.
152	True	a	Hey guys, I've been living off of protein shakes and cereal these past few days because I can't really afford to buy anything yet, and I've just about run out of anything. The few leftover dollars I did have went towards food for my gerbils. If anyone could help me out with some food for tonight that would be great. I just have to wait one more day and I'll have some income coming in, I'll be able to help anyone in need tomorrow :] edit: Pizza is on the way, thanks to you.
153	False	a	A little about me: I am in a supportive living program for chemical dependency after completing a rigorous in-patient detox program. Myself and three other guys share an apartment and we get all of our food from the facilities 'food pantry.' We aren't starving but I know I haven't enjoyed the tasty goodness of a pizza in over 41 days! One of the other guys has been deprived for nearly 90 days! I will do whatever is necessary to substantiate my story if need be. Thanks for taking the time to check this out.
154	True	a	didn't really think out my budget. have money for books but no food. you could make a poor college student so happy.
155	False	a	Hello! :)  My roommate is a 19-year old college student who has a beautiful baby girl (who was born while he was still in high school).  The mother is a year younger and takes care of her while he is at our apartment for university - but he heard today that his baby is sick and in the hospital.  He can't miss class, so he's stuck hours away from his baby in our apartment worried sick.  In addition, while riding on a bus to class, he took his keys out (it was about to storm) and put them in his hands to get into his car immediately after exiting the bus.  He left the bus, but apparently forgot his keys, and had to wait outside as it stormed for the bus to loop around (takes anywhere from 20 minutes to 45), then found out that the keys somehow made their way onto ANOTHER BUS, so he had to go back to campus, chase down the bus they were on, and finally get home.  All during a storm.  I'm broke for a few days until I get some money, and I'll definitely pay it forward down the line when I have some money to spend, but if someone could spare a few dollars and help get my roommate's week back on track, I'd love you forever.  EDIT: We live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana
156	True	a	So, long story short, today has been a really crappy day. Unfortunately, it's going to continue to be crappy until the 5th when I get my first paycheck from my new job working night shifts. I would love to turn this day around with some pizza, and I'll be paying it forward as soon as I get the paycheck. 
157	False	a	Well, they say when things get worse the shit hits the fan. Well in my case the shit hit the fan, the fan blade let loose, and smashed into my damn window!  Lost my job, bank account is under, Lost all of my groceries i just bought when the power went out, and my car is acting like its gonna kick the bucket.  All that being said, being I have no food, I sure could use a tasty pizza. At least the only thing good about my day could be what lies in my stomach.
158	False	a	"Well I thought I had it all straightened out with student loans, rent, cable, electricity, phone, etc. but my car decided it didn't want to play ball and so I'm a bit short on cash for the next two weeks.  I'd truly appreciate a random act of delicious pizza.  P.S. first time on this subreddit and I'm blown away by the community.  No other site is quite like this.  I have Facebook ""friends"" who probably wouldn't buy me a slice of pizza and here you guys are, strangers buying each other whole pies. Incredible.  **EDIT:** I was hooked up by a non-RAOP source, but I appreciate what you guys do here.  "
159	True	a	Im at home with my siblings while my moms working midnights. My dads overseas and they miss him a lot. I just wanna surprise them with pizza and a game to at least get their minds off him tonight and put a little smile on their faces. but I don't have money for the pizza. :( Anything would help. 
160	False	a	Let me tell you about the coolest fuckin' rat ever. He got his name because the first night I got him he jumped straight onto a double cheese pizza from papa johns, like in the damn middle and me and my friends were gassed, so this was hilarious, and hence the name Cheesy Basil. He was a righteous little dude, I'm bummed the fuck out and just miss my boy. He had a tumor on his neck and the vet told me last week there was nothing we could do, I live in central VA and it's a struggle to find help for them. I gotta give a picture of him to you guys,   http://imgur.com/cpz1Lks  He always fell asleep in my lap, like, I won't ever have another little guy quite like him. Still, I had him for 6 years, and he and I had some of the best times ever. He loved to sit on my shoulder while I smoked, and I won't have my best little friEnt with me for 4/20?  It's just going to be a sad night. Sorry for my story, I just want a pizza to remember my lil cheesy bastard.   
161	False	a	And all we have left in the house is ramen noodles. We're really sick of eating them so a pizza would really make our weekend :)!! We'd really appreciate it and pay it forward when we get paid!
162	False	a	Hi all,  My fiance dreads his birthday. I was really excited to make it the best birthday I could. Unfortunately, the cards did not fall that way. Recently we've been going paycheck to paycheck with the little we have over going to food, and lawyers fees (custody battle). I was saving a little aside for his birthday, but unfortunately since I work on commission, it didn't come through the past two weeks. I only had money to pay bills and rent.  I was hoping anyone that had a spare moment and some cash could help me buy a pizza for him this afternoon. We can even consider it a loan. I will pay you back.   Thanks for listening.
163	False	a	I'm hungry in Virginia! My stomach is makin' the rumblies that only a cheese pizza can satisfy. Hit me up! Plus I want to show my friends that if you tell the driver to draw a wizard on the box in the special instructions, he'll totally do it. I've got 0 dollars. &lt;3 http://imgur.com/KlUSB
164	False	a	He just started a new job and has to wait until the 1st for his first paycheck. I'm trying to do something to make his day, but we're both broke until he gets paid on the 1st. If anyone wants to help me put a smile on his face, that'd be awesome!
165	False	a	hello, my husband has become unemployed and i really could use a pizza to cheer me and my kids up. we are living in vancouver, and anything would really help. thank you!!!
166	False	a	I want a 'zza somethin' awful, and this craving's reaching a critical level. We're talking about an urgency never before felt by human- or (ninja) turtlekind. Please help me in my quest for gooey cheese and tasty toppings!
167	True	a	Hey ROAP, I would love to surprise my family with a pizza tonight. We have no money until tomorrow night and our only option until then is thin spaghetti with ranch dressing :D We can do it, but a pizza would be appreciated more than you know! I promise to pay it forward once we get back on our feet. Thanks :)  Wesley Chapel, Florida  EDIT: Just finished a delicious pizza from rogers4201! THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH!!
168	False	a	I don't like asking for things (hence me using a side account), but my mom and I could really use some food. I haven't been able to find a job, and she works ultra hard, but w/o child support we can't even pay rent. I think the only thing we have to eat is some canned pineapples. If you want proof I'm an active redditor and not just a beggar, I'll send a screen shot of me logged into my real account or w/e. I just don't want my friends to know about my situation. Thank you for this wonderful website! (sorry I don't have any cats.) 
169	False	a	Been in kind of a slump lately, really missing home (Maryland). Florida is particularly chilly tonight, and is really driving the homesickness further. Pizza would be great. I didn't just finish my finals, or break up with my girlfriend. I have some food in the fridge.. Pizza would just be really nice right now. But of course, there are plenty of hungry Redditors out there. Take care of those guys, and let me know if there's any pizza love left.  Thanks for being Reddit 
170	True	a	I feel kind of guilty asking this, because I'm usually the person helping out others, not the one looking for help. I just finished my summer term last night and wanted to celebrate somehow, and pizza is the go-to food for college students, right? Well, I wanted to order some Domino's last night for a night of PS3 fun but quickly realized it wasn't financially feasible at the time. In fact, I can't even get 10 bucks worth of gas right now to leave my apartment.  If you want, I can get screen shots of my grades to verify. And I **WILL** pay it forward when I get paid next month (my only income is from the GI Bill, as I am unemployed right now). I'll send you the link when I do and of course I will thank you on here, publicly.
171	True	a	Recently I have been given the opportunity to move schools, where I would be away from the people who would 'use' me (bully doesn't sound a justified word somehow) however the catch is that I would know absolutely nobody there, I will be practicing for my A-levels later this year and I feel a lot of pressure on me by my family and peers. So my favorite foods is Italian (Pasta, Gnocchi, Pizza ect.) and it would be of a great service if I could get some comfort food or even some advice to help me be calm, I really don't know whether this decision will be good for me or not. Please help!
172	False	a	On 07/17/11 at 11:30 My wifey and I became parents for the first time.  We were not in great financial standing to begin with, but I have done everything I could over the last few months to buy things to have us ready for the baby, and everything is doing great there.  However, wifey is already starting to feel the post-partum depression setting in.  She feels like we will never be able to enjoy life again because money is a little tight right now.  We both have jobs, etc. so things will be better.  However the tastiest food we have had is Hamburger Helper made with 70/30 beef in the past week and a half.  And so, a random pizza would be great...  TL;DR New Baby, The mother is depressed because we are eating out of cans already, trying to lift her spirits.  Can provide proof of everything above.  EDIT 1: http://imgur.com/Ciums Photo of me holding my little girl after her first bath.  The Pooh robe was something Wifey said we HAD to buy.  It is pretty cute 
173	False	a	ok so heres the deal cut and dry put ten bucks in the gas tank got two left , broke til friday and the only thing in my fridge is a old piece of meatloaf in a tupperware container that i dare not open, i can provide a picture or whatever else anyone needs as proof but a pizza would make my day a gadzillion times better
174	False	a	Will be returning home tomorrow to Warren, Rhode Island after a long train ride home from Florida for my brother's wedding - will be getting in around 6pm, left today at 7pm - 23 hour trip with layovers! A pizza would be immensely appreciated.
175	False	a	Hi I'm shmuel. I know I just joined Reddit but I in real need here. Just moved across the county to Portland Oregon. I lost my bank card and I don't have anything to eat!  Please help nee out. I now know what it means to go hungry! 
176	True	a	"I am currently between jobs, although I have one offer that is almost a done deal and I should begin working soon. I am struggling with my bills at the moment, although I'm seeking help from friends and family. My fridge is really bare, and any spare money I have is currently going toward paying my rent. ""Luckily,"" I recently got a concussion and haven't had much of an appetite, so I can make what little food I get last longer. If anyone could help me eat for a few days, I would be incredibly grateful. I'll also pay it back as soon as I get back up on my feet, which hopefully won't be long.   Thanks so much!"
177	False	a	"Could really use a pizza while I work on assignments after work tonight. This week has been hell. My ""friend"" moved to Ontario with a bunch of my shit. Been working full time, but still only have 8 bucks left after paying my rent. Finals are fast approaching, as well as the deadlines for my university assignments. This and my work week isn't slowing down. Could just use the pick me up after work tonight I guess."
178	False	a	I don't really have a sad story or anything to tell, I'm just exhausted and forgot to get groceries.  I've been working my retail job for the last few days straight.  I got off my shift today and made the mistake of getting comfy.  I completely forgot to grab food before heading home.  Other than toasted bread and tap water, my options for dinner are moot.  If someone would be willing to save this tired man a trip out and order some Pizza in my place, you will have firmly restored the faith in humanity that being a retail servant has taken from me.
179	False	a	Reposting this hoping we might end up with some food..  ...in the middle of Ohio.  As the bucket of pennies suggests we're particularly broke and warm food is hard to come. We're not getting paid until mid-February (and some of us are still looking for work). We'd greatly appreciate any help.. and a warm pizza would be great.  On our way we just passed a Chinese place and missed the lunch special (only affordable thing) by a couple of minutes so the possibility of warm food is still too real in our minds.  
180	False	a	I don't know what's going on, but I came home today and there's no check in my bank account. I was suppose to get paid on Friday, but of course it was a holiday. I expected it to go in today, but it didn't. And payroll is closed today, so I won't know till Monday. Netflix took the last $16 out of my bank account yesterday, so I'm negative 10 cents now. I'm pretty sure my money will go in Monday, but until then I'm out of food. Is there anyway somebody can send a pizza, some wings, or anything just to tide me over until Monday? I don't have any kids or anything like that it's just me, but I only go grocery shopping every 2 weeks. So not being able to go yesterday left me with very little to work with. I would greatly appreciate any help anyone could provide. Thank you for reading.  Rodger 
181	False	a	Studying and stressed for a class I am going to fail anyways, won't be able to graduate on time and moving in 3 days (i.e. no groceries). A pizza would be a comforting thing and a very tasteful distraction.
182	True	a	Of all the forums I've seen on here, this one is the most interesting, most interactive, and the most uplifting.   Need some of that right about now. I think I sprained my ankle because I was scared I was going to be late to work. I was three minutes early. Then I got laid off. My wife has a reliable job, but it's only meant for secondary income. Grocery day is on Friday, but we have to start cutting back and saving as soon as we can. We probably won't have pizza for a while so if anyone can help us and the kids out, it'd be great. I can't promise to pay it back on a certain day, but I will do it as soon as I can.  Off to the fun world of resume writing....  Thank you all for doing what you do and for reading my post!
183	False	a	So we are sitting here starving and then it comes to us! Random Acts of Pizza! so we figured wed give it a try. Now we dont have much to offer cept the fact that we could pay it forward (eventually) AND we could write you (our savior who decideds to help) a custom song bro! to show all your friends haha. Why the hell not eh?
184	False	a	No sob story just hungry and bored.
185	True	a	Tried this once before but I guess it never went through! Hoping to someone feels like sharing a great weekend by helping me start off a nice lunch/dinner meal! 
186	False	a	Second day of classes and I'm low on funds and food. A friend is here with me in a fairly similar situation and we're low on hope as well. Won't someone lend a hand to two lads from Danville, VA?
187	False	a	There is a Papa Johns right near us and I have a 50% off code if you'd like to use it. I looked and the total for the Pizza we would like would end up being $11.66 with the coupon.  More Info:  I started a new job on Friday and we get paid every other week, starting next week (so I'll only get paid for one day on my first paycheck on 9/7).  We have about $1080 in our checking account and rent ($1050) comes out within the next couple of days.  Husband won't get paid again until 9/14.    As for proof, I can take a screenshot of our bank account balance and a couple of past rent deductions from the account so you can see the amount and them coming out the first of the month.  I can also show where he got paid on Friday.
188	False	a	I have been unemployed for a year and I would like to treat my two boys to something besides top roman or food bank food.  Just a little help would be great.  Bless everyone and happy 4th of July!
189	False	a	I recently lost my job, and I have been living off chef boyardee and ramen noodles for the past couple weeks and a pizza would really brighten my mood and help me alot, can anyone help!?
190	False	a	I'm going to be completely honest here about my stupidity. I went to the store today and spent my last bit of money buying some alcohol and didnt even think about the fact that I have no food. Now I am at home, and have no money and no food in my house.  A friend of mine told me about you guys, so I thought I would give it a try. Thank you in advanced for even reading this.  Cheers
191	True	a	I ran out of money on my meal card a while back, and finished the last of my easymac/sandwich stuff yesterday. Luckily for me the term is almost over, so I only need to survive for another week. A pizza would really help lighten that burden, and I could stretch it out to last. If you send anything my way, I'd love to write you a song telling you how awesome you are and record it.  Edit: As far as my music, I do orchestral/soundtrack like stuff, and some folk and jazz.
192	False	a	I haven't had any work for close to two weeks now, its been rough and I have been cooped up in the house, I told my brother about reddit and this subreddit, he told me to give it a try. Just throwing this out there, I plan on repaying the favor when I get to work again.  Thanks
193	True	a	So today I got fired, which blows. My car got hit last night in the parking lot and the whole front in is destroyed. I called into work and said if I didn't make it in I would be fired. I couldn't find a ride from anyone, so I got fired. Definitely a total bummer day. If anyone can help me out, I would appreciate it a ton.
194	True	a	Hey - The title says it all. After a week of exams, I'm letting myself spend the weekend playing Oblivion, since Skyrim is soon to come out, and I have yet to play Oblivion for myself.  I'm waiting for a client (freelance webdesign is my job) to pay me Sunday, so until then, I really have no food other than chili I made 5 days ago, and has been my only meals every day since.  I'll even do any crazy thing you tell me to do in game, if you're familiar with Oblivion, and consider it done (for better or for worst). I'll murder towns in the name of pizza!  It'd really help - thanks!  [Charlotte, NC]
195	False	a	Hi all...  I've hit one of those lows. I have $1.95 in the bank and I ran out of the spaghetti I was eating once a day a couple days ago. I spent 30 minutes looking around the house for loose change and managed to find enough to get some peanut butter which is remarkably filling and has kept me relatively satisfied since. But it's running out and before I start pawning things off I thought I'd try to look for my own personal Pizza Jesus. Thank you all for the awesomeness that is RAOP.  [money](http://imgur.com/LTQk5.jpg)  [what I have survived on for two days](http://imgur.com/jn6Eh)  Needless to say I will contribute at my first financial opportunity.  edits: spelling. because that's still important.
196	False	a	So my girlfriend just left me. This left me and my best friend out of a roommate but still with rent due. So we voted for a house rather then food. We have been eating a spam/green bean/potato casserole for a few days and I would love a chance of pace.
197	False	a	~~I lost my job today after being really sick for a couple of days. I tried to make bean burritos tonight, but after hours of cooking, the beans are still hard! I'm very hungry but very broke. Any kindness would be greatly appreciated.~~  Upon researching our scenario, I remembered a recent credit card bill I paid a bit of. Thankfully, we'll be able to afford our food for the night. We (Necrizzo and his g/f) can thankfully splurge on some 'za for ourselves tonight.
198	False	a	Hi all, I am new and am trying to get some food for me and my wife and 2 kids. I got this site from a friend that said I could get help here at least for tomorrow.  Can I please get some pizza for us. My wife doesn't get a pay check til Thursday. 
199	True	a	I have just under $13 to get me through until next thursday. I've been eating peanut butter sandwiches for a couple of days and a hot pizza sounds amazing. One pizza would most likely last me 2 or 3 days.
200	False	a	Title says it. Just a college lad trying to work my way through.  [This is all the charisma I can offer while at work.](http://www.imgur.com/q0xmV.jpeg)
201	False	a	I am currently on a diet and going to the campus gym, and I am maintaining myself healthy, but sometimes there are just times when I need to satisfy a craving.  No sad story, just want some pizza
202	False	a	My roomie and I are starving, a pizza would help boost morals around finals time!
203	False	a	Help me cope with my hangover and lack of funds and transportation for the day.
204	False	a	I just want to say that hearing about this site today warms my heart.  I was laid off from my job and still trying to find a new one.  I'm only 3 months pregnant but not having any money that could be quite a scare. I'd like to say by the grace of God today there is food in the fridge thanks to food stamps.  But there were definitely times where a pizza would have lifted my spirits, and the fact that there are people here doing just that for others, you are all amazing.  If I had the funds right now to make an offer I would be doing so as well.  But let's just hope I don't need to make any requests anytime soon.  I just wanted to tell you all that you are great people. 
205	True	a	"[cowabunga!](http://imgur.com/LufK0) Does anyone know what ""Bodacious Slicage"" means?  Young family with 2 kids here; its Pizza or oatmeal for dinner tonight :-/."
206	True	a	Just kidding. I'm so hungry right now and a pizza would hit the spot. I will draw you an excellent picture(whatever you want me to draw really). If that doesn't satisfy you, maybe I could take pictures of cats for you (karma compensation for the pizza)
207	False	a	It's a slow Sunday afternoon and I'm both bored and hungry so I thought I'd have a go at fixing both of these at once. Think up a challenge which you'd deem worthy of a pizza and I'll give it a go and post pics. If you think I did well enough you can congratulate me with some delicious pizza.
208	False	a	I cannot stand the idea of turning on the oven and heating the house more, and I'm low on groceries anyway.   If anyone could help out, my boyfriend, son, and I would greatly appreciate it!
209	False	a	So today I've had the worst day ever basically. This morning me and my girlfriend got into a huge fight, and she left me for who knows how long. Not to mention I lost my job a week ago or so. I just ran out of trees (yes i am an ent) and the entire town is dry at the moment (I live in orlando). I'm also running really low on money, and don't have any income coming in any time soon, seeing as I just lost my job. On top of all of this, my two bestfriends have been total douchebags lately, and we were supposed to go get cici's pizza later today (it's only 5 bucks) but they both bailed on me. This has been the 5th time in the past few weeks that they've ditched me, for no reason at all. Anyways, if any of you redditors would be kind enough to send a guy a pizza now, I would really appreciate it
210	False	a	As the title says. Finished last of my exams not to long ago and finally found work.  I don't get my first pay until Friday and could use a pizza to make the hunger go away :].   Sorry for the throw away account. I can provide you with my actual account (Reditor for nearly two years, second time using this subreddit). My friends / siblings often stalk me on reddit and I don't want them to know im in a shitty financial situation for the time being and offering their help.   Silly logic I know, won't ask family but will ask strangers on the internet for food :P.  My pride... its a very strange form of pride. 
211	False	a	I'm residing in Jacksonville, Fl. and my parents are out of town for the week. Im with my 8 year old brother and we don't have much unexpired food aside from ramen noodles. I don't have any physical money(at least not enough to order food) and it would be nice to be able to order pizza for ourselves. Obviously this is a somewhat trivial situation and there are people who's situations deserve to be prioritized over this but if you are in a situation where we are the ideal choice that would be awesome.  Edit: Has received pizza from the lovely redditor, makoswimmer &lt;3
212	False	a	Started studying in December for my Design and Pricing actuarial exams. Results came out Friday. I scored a 5 and the pass mark is a 6. Due to the way they're changing the exam requirements, this means I'll have an extra year (at least) before I finish exams.
213	False	a	Father has cut me off completely, refuses to pay for my final semester in school have been searching for jobs in LA for the past 2 months with no luck. I've sold most of my video games, music equipment and just about everything of value for food, but have finally run out of things to sell. Am finally giving up and will be flying to Florida next week to stay with my mother find a job and save up so I can return to school.  I would be eternally grateful if anyone could help me out with a pizza :)
214	False	a	Sold most of my records to have enough money for bills and to travel to an event in NY to sponsor. Don't NEED a pizza, but would like one. Will take care of a fellow RAOP user next week! 
215	False	a	My husband is at work for the next 4 hours, using our only car for the rest of the night. It's raining, I'm cold, and my puppy and I are hungry.   Won't anyone take pity on me and our sob story??
216	False	a	I've been out of work and I finally just got a job. A friend I know who works at 7-11 gave me a application today to fill out and turn in tomorrow for a job and I would be extremely grateful if I could eat well tonight (it's been a while) I figured this was the place to post! Much love and I appreciate what everyone does here. I lurk a lot but reading here usually makes my day! Thanks for reading.
217	False	a	I am a mother of two a 3 yr old and a 5 month old we are in tough times living at my mothers house trying to find a place to live. I am a stay at home mother while my fiancee works a full time minimum wage job to try to scrape by. due to the past few tough weeks my mother has decided that we have to leave by the beginning of august. I have just spent the last of our food stamps and money on our baby boy to buy him formula.  we are broke stressed out and in need of someone to raise our spirits. 
218	False	a	I have a jerb but the bills and car repairs ate up all my funds till next week, Roomates are all out of town and I was hoping a fellow redittor could hook me up with an online order for a Dominos medium pizza. It's only like 6 bucks! :/
219	False	a	I have been low on cash for the past month, and with that i've also been hungry having to pay rent insurance electricity and all of my bills I have no room for enjoying a hot meal, so if any one with a kind heart can help me out, I can do the same as soon as i'm back on my feet 
220	False	a	A pizza would give me a couple of days' worth of food that's a little different than what I've been eating for the last few months. I'll do whatever verification is necessary.
221	False	a	Making it month to month on Government Disability (proof upon request) and any help is greatly appreciated! God Bless!
222	False	a	This may seem like a strange request, but there's only one place that delivers to where I am in SF and my phone isn't working and they don't have online ordering for where I am. If anyone could help me to order pizza, I would be immensely grateful   Edit: many thanks to MusicsFan!
223	False	a	Hi RAOP I'm a student in Florida and I would like to request a pizza. My situation is that I've run out of money basically paying tuition for summer classes and have to survive for two weeks on about $15 until my financial aid check comes in the mail. I would greatly appreciate a pizza or gift card in order to make surviving a bit easier. Thanks for reading
224	False	a	My girlfriend and I are living in a trailer with my brother while we go to school. If any of you have lived in a trailer, you should know that a little bit of heat goes a long way, especially when there is no AC (which is our case). Turning on the stove or oven raises the temperature to the point where my greatest fear becomes spontaneous combustion. I'd be glad to pay it forward when I can!
225	False	a	Hi all,   We just moved across Canada and are moving into our new place here in Edmonton, Alberta. Long story short, the movers completely botched our move and we are not getting our property for another week. The move has been tough on us financially and emotionally, we could use a break. Wondering if anyone out there wants to send some pizza over our way. We will return the favour in two weeks once we get settled into our new place.
226	False	a	Hey guys, 2 stressed out students need your help! Starting final exams tomorrow and the revision isn't going well! One of us is reading Ulysses all tonight and the other is trying to learn statutes and cases off! Very stressed out and panicked over these exams! Will be pulling an all-nighter for tomorrow so would appreciate a pizza to save us cooking time! We will return the favour once exams end and we can earn money again!  Thanks :)
227	False	a	Straight up budgeted poorly and now I'm starving.  I'm in NYC, and would love a pick me up pizza pie from a fellow Redditor.   Help me out with some of the delicious kind of dough.
228	False	a	Hi all! The past few days I've been getting pretty creative putting meals together but it's getting tough. And my older girl's having a hard time adjusting to 1st grade so it'd be a nice surprise for her tonight. If anyone could help that'd be awesome and I'll pay it forward right after I restock the fridge! Thanks!
229	False	a	I have only had Pizza Hut and other cookie cutter style.   Tim
230	False	a	Hello fellow Redittors,  I'm a long time reddit lurker (started last summer with the keanu meme) with one favor to ask one kind redittor.  Last night I found out that the pasta box in the counter was empty so I ate my last sandwich and I don't have anything for tonight's dinner.  I would be extremely grateful if one of you generous redittors offered to help me with dinner tonight.  Any type of help is appreciated.
231	False	a	Leaving for a flight early tomorrow (I can show you my online boarding pass) Needless to say flying makes me a little jittery and pizza is a big comfort food for me, would probably help me sleep.  I also have a confirmation code thingy if you want to see it.  Many thanks pizza givers!
232	True	a	Hey all,  My life is in the gutter right now.  I've been trying to find a job while trying to take night classes, but neither are working out very well at this point.  I've got a little bit of my reserves left, but that has to last me for the unforeseeable future, and I don't know when or where my next job will come from.  I know it may sound a little sad, but I've forgotten what pizza tastes like, it's been so long since I've had any.  And being transplanted from Chicago, this is not a good feeling.  Anyone have it within themselves to help me out?
233	False	a	(Los Angeles)  Hey all, I'm running low on food and money until my payday next week and I could really use a pizza to help tide me over. July is tough for getting work but August is supposed to be better for me, I'd like to return the favor when I can.  Closest Pizza place is a Dominos  Thanks
234	False	a	Wife and newborn are out of town for the night at relatives and I'm home alone. I have some tuna of hers here I could honestly make but I'd rather have a pizza.   Thanks for taking a look :)
235	False	a	Hey redditors. I'm going to be hanging out with a couple of friends tonight and watching a movie. I've been off work sick for a while now and don't really have the spare cash for pizza currently. I'm not really struggling or starving. I just like pizza and haven't had any in a while. I would enjoy it greatly. 
236	False	a	Hello, my name is Lauren I'm a 21 year old pregnant college student studying for her finals in psychology. I was not fortunate enough to have parents who can help me financially. Anyone who lives in New York knows that monthly metro cards are $104. My paycheck went to that and my cell phone bill. If there is anyone who can help me by purchasing a pizza so I can have some fuel to study for my exams. I attend school in manhattan New York
237	False	a	It would be amazingly appreciated and make both of our days. Will provide verification code if requested.
238	False	a	Long story short, I basically ran out of money back in late June. I spent essentially the entire month of July eating things like empty taco shells for dinner, my roommate's scraps from the night before for breakfast, and some days simply eating nothing. Yes I know boo-hoo, just wanted to say I found this subreddit today and it's one of the best ones!  Again, I do NOT want a pizza, only giving props to an awesome sub. You guys are kewl.
239	True	a	Hello!  I haven't had pizza in the longest time and I have this *huge* craving for it. If there is someone who is in dire need of food please skip me and go to them! But if not, I'd love to celebrate the end of a day with some awesome sauce pizza. 
240	False	a	Hi, I'm new here obviously, found this through a random acts of kindness group I participate in.  My family has had a rough patch the last few months, we had some friends stay with us for what was supposed to be a couple weeks but turned into a couple months where they took advantage of us and basically left us in a really bad place financially because they broke our furniture, took almost all of our childrens toys and really didn't help pay for anything except about $600 in groceries a month when they were a family of 6 not very small people.  Needless to say though we're in the last week of the month and our kids have been troopers through all this and we'd really like to get them a special pizza treat but only have $4 to our name.  My husband and I have 2 beautiful kids a 6 year old girl and 2 year olf boy. Starting next month we'll also have my 9 year old stepson and hopefully by then we will have finished recovering financially from all this.  Thank you ahead of time and we look forward to giving the gift of Pizza to someone else who could use it or needs it on the first. We are in Colorado.
241	True	a	I'm a 22 year old guy living in the outskirts of Seattle. I lost my job a couple months ago because of anxiety issues and have been barely making it by. I'm practically down to my last packet of ramen. =(  I have an exciting job opportunity now, and if everything goes well, I should be starting next week! I'll dedicate my first pay-check to you guys and offer someone else in need a free pizza! Please help me out, reddit! =)
242	False	a	The three of us live in a tiny house (dubbed: The Hobbit Hole) and all are bicycle mechanics in the area. Obviously, it is not the most profitable of seasons for us- although I have taken on a job working the door at a local bar (as has another of my roomates), as well as an after school assistant in a town nearby. But Paychecks are two weeks away, and will finally make life easy again! Two of us are finishing getting our degrees.   It's been a long day, and we Just managed to scrape rent together, but don't really have a great amount of food in the house (save some rice, eggs and oatmeal, that we need to save for the rest of the week and until our next paychecks)   We Just really want to enjoy a pizza together on a sunday night!   Thanks RAOP!
243	False	a	I'm not asking for pizza for myself (I'm vegan) but for my friend. He lives in LA (I live on the east coast) and has fallen on hard times. He's going to school and will graduate in December, but was laid off a couple of months ago and will soon be evicted. I don't really have any expendable income at the moment. Maybe some internet kindness can lift his spirits. Thank you. 
244	False	a	Hey guys, my per diem check never came and we were counting on itWe are paying rent today (late as is)And we won't have any money left for the rest of the week. I budget like crazy but my SO had to go away to.work for a week, so he had to pay to love separately from us. So we are very behind and broke.Well the check hasn't come and was suppose to be here a week ago.I will return the favor in a few weeks when we get all caught up.Anyone want to help a girl out?Much appreciated! 
245	True	a	I just spent $75 dollars paying to get my application seen at the school I'm applying to. I also just payed out the wazoo for a deposit for a rental house and I don't have any more money coming to me for the rest of the month. I barely have enough to make it to the end of the month, a pizza would really help. 
246	False	a	I'd buy it myself, but he lives in Washington and I live in Texas, and I don't have a debit card. Since the technology to email a pizza hasn't been invented yet, I'll thank anyone who orders him one by drawing them something in return :D
247	False	a	was walking to the store  and saw this beautiful cat  and i couldn't just leave it there .He look so hungry  so i took him  in .I named him Gabriel  i stood up all night trying to bathe him and  spend the last of money  i had to go out just for him i brought him food , scratching post and a bed and toys.   ny,ny 
248	False	a	It seems i got two tickets from toll violations and now i have to pay $285.40 each ticket before the 11/27 or my license will get suspended, i am a broke college student and i am not really sure how i am gonna pay this, could use a pick me up pizza for lunch, thanks a lot....
249	False	a	 My sister and I haven't had a decent meal for the past 2 weeks due to our sick parents who lives in the Philippines. We've been sending them money to get the medicine they need. However, we're in a very desperate time in our lives and we really need a decent meal.   Btw : We live in CT.  We are willing to pay it forward as soon as we get a chance.
250	False	a	my uncle and best friend just died in the past week all of my money is going to medical bills helppppppp pleasssssseeeeeeee  
251	False	a	I don't even think it could work, but I would be really thankful because I'm starving, penniless and sick of eating whole grain bread. As far as I know, the only way to get pizza here is over the phone. We have pizza hut, Domino's, Papa John's and some other local things. 1 dollar is about 500 Chilean Pesos. If we don't make it, at least we could have fun trying to figure out a way!  ps. yep, i've posted it before, but I'm still poor and hungry!
252	False	a	Been working for a month and my job hasn't paid me so I can't buy food . Would love a pizza to get me through this weekend of house sitting.
253	False	a	They are being fussy about it, Won't get sorted till August 12th at least.  I would normally be paid on a week to week basis but well not at the momment...  Requesting Thursday nights dinner.
254	True	a	She loves pizza, and I'm really low on cash. Would gladly pay it forward. Thanks
255	True	a	I've never posted here before so I hope that I am doing this right. This request is actually for a friend, not for me. She recently broke up with her long-time boyfriend and moved back in with her parents. The ex-boyfriend is moving out of state. She is doing her best in college and has always been a good student but the stress is getting to her and she is starting to slip. I think that a pizza would help her out.  **Edit: horny_toad2006 hooked me up. Thank you so much man, she will appreciate it.**
256	False	a	Dear reader,  I would really love to eat pizza on a special occasion like Halloween since I haven't eaten pizza for several months now. It might be a strange request to send a pizza to Japan but it would make me so happy.   I found an English guide for the Japanese Pizza Hut site. http://www.pizzahut.jp/common/pdf/menu/menu_eng.pdf   It would really help me a lot and I wouldn't mind sending you a Japanese postcard back. (they also have pokémon postcards here)  Thank you in advance for all the trouble to be taken.
257	False	a	I just got out of the hospital a few days ago and immediately spent all of my money on a variety of new prescriptions that I needed to start. I'm out of food now and don't get paid until tomorrow. I'm type one diabetic so I'm kind of afraid that if I don't eat anything at all today I'm going to be in rough shape tomorrow. That, and after over a week of hospital food and dry cereal pizza sounds amazing. So if someone would be generous enough to provide me with one, I would appreciate it greatly.
258	False	a	Hey RAOP, My friend's house was robbed last night and I want to do something to ease the shock of it all. I figured the best way is through the power of pizza. The delicious power of pizza.  
259	False	a	Camping out to win free piada for a year. I'll take you with me if you send me pizza thanks
260	False	a	Heyall, basically title says it all. I'm bored, at home, in my basement with very bad internet for the moment. A pizza would really amuse me :P  General location : Massachussets (specifically Eastern MA)
261	True	a	so, yeah. im prayin someone finds it and gets a hold of me, til then, its just a waiting game i guess. im pretty pissed at myself. i have no cash whatsoever until thursday, i was supposed to go shopping tonight but that obviously isnt happening. we're basically out of food, my mother is bringin over some groceries tomorrow to hold us over for the week. can anyone help out for tonight? its for me and my 2 daughters. more than happy to take it as a loan and pay it back thursday. youd really be helping a ton. need verification/proof? ask away, many thanks
262	False	a	I was kicked out of my house a week ago and my girlfriend broke up with me a few nights ago. I'm sitting in my friend's house with not much to do and would love to go on a walk to pick up a pizza for us to eat tonight.
263	False	a	I'm waiting for my G.I. Bill to come in, hopefully by the end of the month. Until then I am stuck with 99 cent loaves of bread and peanut butter which has also run out. I have 3 dollars in my account and I'm starving. Make a random request and I will fulfill it!  Since I made this post so late I don't think I will see any response. Thanks for those who read this post. Good luck in your RAOP!
264	False	a	Please I'll &lt;3 you forever.
265	True	a	First time making a request. Money is tight recently thanks to a shift change at work and losing my 10% night shift differential. I'm off today and tomorrow so no rush :) thanks in advance
266	False	a	I don't ask for any pizza I only ask for your vote in a local pizza poll.  My girlfriend is an Italian immigrant and thus her dad is also Italian. Her dad is the owner and founder of Ciro's New York Pizza in Centerville Virginia. I find the man honorable and look up to him and want to do something for him as a small thank you for his daughter being in my life.  Please if you have a minute of spare time, vote for Ciro's pizza [here](http://www.northernvirginiamag.com/pizza/). Help an immigrant build the American dream.  (if this post is too much a violation of the rules, I understand)
267	False	a	Is it true that people are just giving pizza away on this subreddit? I'm not quite sure if I'm supposed to tell a story about why I need pizza or what but unfortunately I don't have one and I'm not the kind of person to make one up.  I mean I am in college and as an RA I have been on duty all weekend forced to eat the tasteless cafeteria food if that's not worth a sweet greasy pizza I don't know what is.
268	False	a	Not sure what else to say, this is my first time posting here, I am just hungry and can't afford much. A pizza right now would be greatly appreciated. Haven't eaten today and I'm super hungry.
269	False	a	Hello everyone! We are a family of 4 and we are completely out of food for the rest of the month. Is there anyway at all that someone could help us out with egift card to Dominos for today? That way we can at least have something to eat today and try to figure something else out for the rest of the week. We havent had any luck coming up with anything for today. It would mean alot to us. 
270	False	a	I'm crazy broke. Payed on Friday. Can pay back or forward. Dominoes is the cheapest in my area.
271	False	a	HERE IS THE STORY!   So, I'm a broke, recently unemployed college student dealing with some stress.   I did something i've never done before, and asked for a Pizza.   And then I had second thoughts, because I felt really horrible asking for a pizza when there are people out there with REAL problems. So I deleted my post.   Then, an amazing redditor Pizza'd me anyways, So I am redoing this post so that the proper flair can be assigned.   Thank you, Lordelf, I will repay your kindness as soon as I am able to. 
272	False	a	My parents died when I was young and I have been living in fostercare since I was 6, I now work 3 jobs just to make ends meet. I am really hoping someone kind will spare some american pesos and spare a girl a pizza  love  Sammy 20/f/MA
273	False	a	Would like to have a pizza tonight
274	False	a	I have posted in the food pantry to try and get some help for my mom and brothers, but I am asking if anyone could get them a pizza or two, they ran out of the food I gave them to eat while on a bus back to El Paso, yes, it wasn't much, but I was able to get them each a protein bar and a water for the trip, but money is so tight I am struggling myself but this is not for me just them please, they are my only concern. Mom and my brothers are good people but they fell on hard times and I didn't have the money to come home with them yet I know a pizza by itself won't solve their problems, but after a 24 hour bus trip from my home in California back to moms home in Texas, it would be a blessing and I am trying so hard to find a way to help them, I miss them so damn much. Well it is most likely too late to get a pizza for them this evening, but I still have faith, i talked to them and that made me happy, just wish i could do more right now. Please help me if you can. Nicole
275	False	a	I wanted to lean on the community really quick for some pizza tonight.   Lost my bank card on Saturday afternoon and I am really sick of oatmeal and frozen veggies, since that  is the only thing left in the fridge.    I give my word I will pay it forward by the end of this week if not sooner and get some else pizza.  Thanks for reading 
276	True	a	domino's is fine, really anything. just super hungry!! pretty please, and thank you so much. umass amherst, by the way. USA. Massachusetts. 
277	True	a	With Boston and all I'm pretty much on the bottom of the food chain but I'm at the point where I'm returning bottles to make Bus fare to get to work. Working while starving is killing my performance to point people are noticing and the spiral downward is starting. I'd have pawned the machine I'm typing on if could have found a shop that would take it. I'm getting paid soon and I'll be sending out pizza as soon as I can. I'm in upstate NY.
278	True	a	It's been a rough few weeks due to an unexpected bill, and I've been completely out of food for two days now. I get paid tomorrow (actually 12:45 am tonight, woot!) but oh my god I'm starving today. Can anyone please help me out? I'm at the end of my rope and desperate. 
279	True	a	So after being a year and 4 months clean off of a serious opiate addiction, i started realizing alcohol was starting to take over my life.  checking myself into rehab on thursday and will be there for the next 60 days.  not trying to gain sympathy for that, as most will say that being in this position is my fault.  but nonetheless, i'm broke, and want to eat some pizza.  would love to return the favor when i get out.    i'm a 22 year old male in texas in case anyone wanted to know. thanks :)
280	True	a	Please, I've tried this before but I never get a pizza :( I've been unemployed for 4 months. Welfare covers just the rent. I haven't had pizza in ages.  
281	False	a	So, I made a throwaway account for this, I hope that's not against RAOP reddiquette. A ton of my friends are on reddit, and none of them know about my financial issues, and I'd like to keep it that way.  I don't have it as bad as some, but I'm freaking starving and this check went totally to other bills. I spearfish to supplement store bought food, but there has been a red tide in San Diego for the past week or so with horrible visibility so I haven't caught anything. Lobster season opens soon though!  So long story short, if you are looking to send out a pizza, I would sure be thankful!  
282	False	a	It took me some time to figure out where to make this post. My friend Mary has received pizza from here, and told me this is where I should post. I worked with her husband at a distribution center that has closed down, and I am at the point between choosing buying medicine and buying food. I was diagnosed with CHF congestive heart failure and underwent triple bypass surgery last year. Going without my medication is not an option and I'm willing to provide pictures of my empty and nearly empty pill bottles. My son is going to help me with food when he gets paid on the 17th, but I really can't go another night without eating. 
283	False	a	My fiance Chris and I (Laura) just moved across town to a new apartment. Unfortunately we got screwed over by the moving company (quoted us around $30 for the truck, costed $80 -.-;) and we barely have enough money to get by until pay day (Aug. 1st). I can barely move let alone cook anything and Chris is in worse shape than I am. We would greatly, greatly appreciate even just a single cheap-o cheese pizza so we can eat. Please help. :(
284	False	a	Schools starting again, i've barely got enough money to pay for it...and there was an antibiotic screw up with my girlfriend...  So now i'm freaking out and theres not going to be much food in the hosue for a week.  Pizza would be a small pick me up.
285	False	a	After a tiring two-weeks, including an ambulance ride for one kid, a hospitalization (she's okay now), 1 with a head ache (she's only 4, and has cluster head aches), and 1 that's home schooled due to bullies (Autism). This mommy is TIRED and could use a pizza night! We can't afford it right now. I'll make it up to you guys and pay it forward when things are not so crazy around here!   Also, for verification of the medical stuff I can forward you to our facebook page for our kids medical updates, I just don't want to post it publicly.   Thanks in advance! 
286	True	a	Hey Reddit,  So my co-worker has been engaged for a while and is moving out to Arizona so she and her fiance can be closer to her fiances daughter. Yesterday she, out of no-where, announces that she is going to get married THIS MORNING. No friends, no family...they just signed a paper at town hall and she even had to come into work after.   My request? This girl is obsessed with Margarita Pizza and Pizza in general...she eats it everyday. She didn't come in with any today though. I'm guessing it's because she just got married with no party and miiiiiight be a little sad about it.  I don't know why they didn't have a ceremony as I'm afraid to bring it up.  Personally, I just started working here and haven't gotten my paycheck yet so I'm broke. Would anyone be able to order a large Margarita for this poor girl?   This is my first post to this r/ so forgive me if I am breaking any rules. I can provide any verification you need but I want this to be a surprise for her!
287	False	a	"Give me your mission and if my response pleases you, feel free to send me a pizza.   Or just make me do something for free if you decide to not send me a pizza, that's fine. Go on a power trip to see how far I will go for a potential pizza? That's fine. I am not ""in need"" but I will do some random things for random pizza.   "
288	True	a	I am Yet Another Poor College Student attending school in Portland, OR and times are tough.  I have had rice and potatoes almost every night for the past week and I would kill for some variety (and some scurvy prevention). I just got hired for a new job today, but I don't begin until the next semester in January, which is kind of a long time.  I mostly stay in lurk mode on reddit but if I get a pizza I solemnly swear to pop back in here when I have spare cash and pay it forward to some people.  In conclusion, http://i.imgur.com/KSzts.jpg
289	False	a	Me and my family never spend time together so i want to try and get a pizza,watch a movie and talk about our day
290	False	a	So I'm a massive idiot who didn't bother checking my new debit card worked before moving away from home and to uni. So at present I'm living off my supplies and roommates good will. But classes begin tomorrow and I think my stomach is in danger of imploding from lack of food :O  I would be infinitely grateful if this was answered. I might make a nice little card on Publisher. (If I have publisher? I'll do something)
291	True	a	This has been a hard week. I don't want to bore you with details, but I'd like to smile and believe there's still good people willing to do good things. I'd love to pay it forward after Friday. Thank you.
292	False	a	It's cold, I'n hungry, and to be completely honest I'm broke. My mum said we're having leftovers for dinner. A random pizza arriving would be nice.  Edit: We had leftovers.
293	False	a	I often buy pizza and ramen and things like that for IRC friends, but they are usually too broke to help me out when things get tough on my end. I have $10 in the bank until Friday.  Order me something from Dominos?  (redid topic after reading formatting rules :p)
294	True	a	My family is so nice and awesome I would love to surprise them with pizza. &lt;3 thanks -Tif
295	False	a	I am a broke college student. I currently don't have enough money to buy any food. I have been eating very minimal since I can't afford to eat. Any help would be appreciated. 
296	False	a	I'm in a transitional phase where I'm looking for my first job and I can't spare any money to feed myself because all my savings need to go to my portion of the rent. My room mates are refusing to share any of the food they can easily afford with me and I'm very uncomfortably hungry. I'm not sure how this works but a friend suggested I try it and I'm offering whatever I can in way of art in return for being able to afford lunch today. I can draw animals and stuff.  Please and Thank you. Your consideration means a ton to me.
297	False	a	My partner and I just moved to this town recently after living out of our car for a while and are really struggling to get by. We put everything we had into getting an apartment so we wouldn't be homeless anymore. I haven't been able to find a job since moving, and my partner just finally found a job this week and won't get his paycheck for another two weeks. Rent is due tomorrow so we have nothing left for food. We have applied for assistance from other programs but haven't received anything as of yet. (Also normally my boyfriend recieves the GI Bill, but we had to move so he couldn't be in school this semester.)   Anyways we have never asked for help before and honestly it's hard even writing this, but we are sitting here trying to scrounge together a meal and it's just not enough. We would love a helping hand until we can get back on our feet - then we'd be happy to pay it forward! Also I'm new to this sub and read the side bar, but if I'm not doing anything correctly just let me know :)
298	False	a	Hey! So I just moved across the country for school. I had a job during the summer, but I just spent every last dime (and maxed out my credit cards) to pay rent/gas for the drive/utilities. I don't get my last paycheck until the 1st on Monday. I won't even have Internet/cable until I get loan disbursements in a month (phoneposting... sigh)  The only food I have available is a cup of butterscotch candies the complex gave me. I'd really appreciate any help I can get. 
299	False	a	Ok I'd like some pizza and thought maybe I could entertain some people to get some.  Hell even if I don't get pizza I'll entertain XD  So make a root comment, with a few topics you want involved, and I'll begin an interactive adventure with you!! 
300	False	a	I am usually the one who gives, but unfortunately like so many others in this economy my family and I have fallen on hard times and would love the special treat of a pizza for dinner. We would be so greatful and appreciate it so very much. I was always taught to give back what God gives you and I would look forward to returning the favor when the clouds part and the sun shines upon us again. God Bless!
301	False	a	We are sitting in the bottom of the library, hungry and none of us want to leave to get food because we might miss part of what we are studying. 300 question with short answer and essay questions suck. Located in Metro-Detroit area.
302	False	a	Hi RAOP! This will be my first time requesting your service. I'm currently a senior up here at the University of Idaho, located in the unbelievably small town, Moscow, where the plains are rolling and the smell of cow ass is abundant.  Anyway, this is my second semester of living in an apartment and I'm still working on getting a budget together. Normally I do a fairly good job, but this semesters worth of books cost about double what I had originally planned for. Normally this wouldn't be too much of a problem, but in a town this small it's very hard to find a job. So I was hoping that a nice meal would be just the break I needed before I get back to struggling through the rest of the semester.  Thanks for listening and have a wonderful day. &lt;3
303	False	a	Am I FLUSH with luck to get a pizza STRAIGHT from a complete stranger? My gratitude would be ACE HIGH...okay that one was forced
304	False	a	Out of money until the first of the month.  Used my last £10 to buy loads of noodles for me and my girlfriend!  I've not been this skint since I was 19 years old, and it's really trying.  I live in Sheffield, any offers would be massively appreciated!  Thanks to all you RAOPers :D
305	True	a	I'm a bit tired of my pantry of noodles and my paycheck comes next week. There's no real sob story, but I would seriously enjoy a change of pace ;)  I will pay it forward on Wednesday :)
306	True	a	The last few weeks have sucked and I could use a pick me up. A pizza would actually make my day.
307	False	a	I'm 38 weeks pregnant and unexpectedly broke after a dr bill I wasn't expecting came up.  I've been living off peanut butter sandwiches the last couple of days and pizza sounds unbelievably good right now. I can provide proof in a pm to anyone who wants it. 
308	False	a	Hey there. I want to thank you in advanced for reading this post and commenting. :) I appreciate it.   I would love a stranger to make my week with a pizza :)  My baby is sick with a cough cold and fever, she has been having horribal nights meaning I haven't gotten much sleep for a few nights. I would love a warm hot pizza so I could get a break from cooking and giving her medicen every four hours.  I am willing to send a handwritten note or take a picture of the box with a special message for you. :)   xoxo
309	False	a	I don't eat the baby animals but I do enjoy me some cheese. Vegetable are for salads. [edit] My apologies, forgot to mention I am from Canada. Thanks to HOTMAMMA for trying anyways!!
310	False	a	Hi I am in need of food for my 4 children we are a military family that has really hit hard times and we have exahusted all means of help just to be able to feed my family and make it through another night is all i ask i know our blessing is coming so whatever u can find in your heart to give is greatly appreciated
311	False	a	1. I might get evicted because my place of employment cut back on my hours.   2. I found out that there is a good chance that I'm not going to celebrate Christmas with my family this year (after not celebrating Thanksgiving with them as well)  3. I'm super broke  4. I made a fool out of myself trying to impress a girl I really like.  Pizza sure does sound nice for lunch.....please help a guy out....:(
312	True	a	Money is scarce this time of year. I've had a lot come up recently, including gallbladder removal. Since then, I haven't attempted fatty, greasy nor cheesy foods because I'd feared for the reaction my body may have, but I'm not sure what else I could request aside from pizza. Money is super tight at the moment and I just can't spare the money to purchase much in terms of food until Wednesday. I made a request on Monday that went without a response and I deleted it. I wasn't aware that was a bannable offense, but learned so from the RAOP chat! Just wanted to bring that to light!  Thank you for your consideration!!!
313	False	a	I've never done this before, but, it doesn't hurt to describe myself. 18, living away from home, barely enough to cover rent in the bank and starving. Pretty, pretty pleaseeee. I'd kill for some Domino's, right now.
314	False	a	  I do have a couple XBOX games I dont play anymore. Halo 4 and Far Cry 3
315	False	a	Reddit please give me A bit of your time, I've smoked my last smoke And spent my last dime  I'm hungry and sick of My bowls of rice, A pizza I think Would be pretty nice  Though my wallet is empty My heart is full, For I met a hottie In my social lull  I'm selling my Playstation To take out this girl, A sacrifice That might make me hurl  Provide me a break A bread cheese duet, One night of pizza I'll be forever in your debt
316	False	a	I am sooo high... I ate my last puppy on Wednesday and my last kitty yesterday. I  have a few more bowls to get through and dont have no fooooddds. I tried to catch my neighbors cat but it ran away. Id go have some Chinese food to match my love of cat and dog but I have no moneys. PLEASE PLEASE I need a pizza, Im seeing stars and rainbows and aint close to emptying this bag yet.   Edit: Forgots me location: Im in Bangme, Mars.
317	True	a	sorry, i am a reddit noob - trying to remember all the terms of the reddiquette so i hope this is okay.  all i can say is i'm just rather short of money right now - i can't tell you how much a pizza would cheer me up while i'm writing my dissertation. it would be sincerely, humbly appreciated.  thanks for looking :)
318	False	a	Not going to lie, I honestly want to see if RAOP is what everyone says it is. Also Pizza is delicious.      PS I live in New Brunswick, Canada.
319	False	a	I have about $2.47 in my bank account because I just paid all my bills, rent, and other school expenses today. It's getting late here, but I have some more studying to do. Would love some pizza to keep my energy up.   If anyone can help, that would be excellent. 
320	False	a	My location is Dublin, Ireland. 
321	False	a	I've been trying to figure out how to send fellow canadian AridDecay a pizza or two - he posted in r/Assistance looking for help and I wanted to send him a warm treat for halloween.  Unfortunately it seems my plans have fallen through - no one will let me pay with CC online, has to be in person.  If anyone could help him out that'd be super cool. I feel mega-bad at failing. =(
322	False	a	that is all. HALP!@#$%^%
323	False	a	bored, kinda crappy week, would really appreciate a pizza. don't have a domino's here, so either papa johns and pizza hut. thank you in advance &lt;3
324	False	a	Title says it all. I will for sure return the favor after my next paycheck. Thanks either way ;)
325	False	a	I haven't been able to go and get paid yet because my boss won't let me near the store for fear that I will infect him.  Plus I've been off work for 4 days now which means I won't get paid for that time.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
326	True	a	I got fired from my job (car broke down and I worked about 25 miles away from home) about 2 months ago and have been managing but the money has just finally run out.  I literally had cheese and pickles here to eat last night.  I'm starting a temp job on Sunday (finally :D) so hopefully I will be able to give in the near future.    This is a great subreddit btw.  It really restores my faith in humanity.  
327	False	a	Hey everybody,  I stumbled into this subreddit yesterday, and the kindness and generosity that is flowing through here absolutely warms my heart.  I don't have a sob story or a starving family to feed, just a kid putting himself through college, so I'm saving every penny I scrape together.  If someone saw it in their heart to help a complete stranger out, I would be incredibly appreciative. 
328	False	a	So, I wouldn't ever think to actually do something like this, and I don't post that often.  But I'm hungry and just about of money and getting very tired of ramen, beans and rice, and ham sandwhiches. The fact that my girl left me this morning makes me even more desperate. (She usually cooks my dinner) If there's anyone out there that could help a fellow redditor you could bring a lot of help to sad soul.  Thanks in advance to anyone kind enough. Will post pics of the pizza and my happy face enjoying them :)
329	True	a	I'm not the best cook in the world and my husband works a 12 hour day, so we would really appreciate it!
330	True	a	I have 4 more days until payday, and I am back on my feet. I'm currently almost done what ever food I have left, which has been bread and peanut butter. I hate to ask this, but can anyone help me with pizza tonight? I am a huge believer in paying it forward, I would gladly do the same for anyone in my position. I just need some help these last few days.  -Thanks to whoever takes the time out and reads this. :) 
331	False	a	My family went to peru and i have to take care of the dogs while there gone, i have run out of food and have no money to buy any. (ontario, canada)
332	False	a	Broke, pregnant and hungry. We won't get foodstamps till the 4th. Would be awesome to get a pizza or two.   Thanks guys!
333	False	a	This is the first time I've gone to RAoP, but I'm kind of in a bad spot.  So I have no electricity to cook anything, and I'm completely broke for the next two days.  Anything at all would help immensly, and I would be more than willing to pay back in any way, shape, or form come Friday.    Thanks a ton for reading and have a great day!
334	False	a	(Request) I have given a few things on reddit, a copy of skyrim + 1 year of xbocks live, and soon to be a binder full of magic cards, when i can mail it. I would love, if possible, a kinder egg. I cant get them in the states, and I want the joy, and wonder, and hell, german chocolate. if you think I am lying, check my submissions and comments, please direct me to where i can get some of this chocolate goodness.... Texas - USA
335	True	a	My poor cat [Pandora](http://imgur.com/onbwp) fell ill a few days ago, so I took her to the vet. She's on Endro Floxacin (22.7 g) for the next week. It took the last of my cash ($100) to get her some help, and I still owe some but it's not due until February. I'm currently in school but will be working soon. My mom is sending me some cash in the mail but it won't get here for a few days. Any help would be nice :)
336	True	a	I've been unemployed going on three months now, and unfortunately my student girlfriend's part time job at the pharmacy doesn't leave much left over for anything but rice. Here's hoping for a hot pizza.
337	False	a	It's been a rough past few months, was down to my last 20 bucks again the other day, and had to buy dogfood, which in turn means I can't eat till Monday. A pizza would easily feed me thru the weekend. If anyone could help that'd be SO appreciated.
338	False	a	I haven't been able to afford much in a while and it would be awesome if someone could help a brother out! The person who buys will get a drawing and a song, both of their choice sent to them via the interwebs.
339	False	a	The year has started great so far. I've moved in to a new apartment , freelance business is picking up, and my part time job is giving me more hours!  Unfortunately I'm without food until my paycheck goes in next week.  Anyone interested in helping out?  I'm willing to pay it forward once I have the means.
340	False	a	I stopped in at purple east to visit the staff, theyre dog tired celebrating their 38th anniversary weekend as a head shop! There is 3 of us and were broke! Please help us eat reddit! Doors close at 7 which I realize is short notice but we shall be here until 7:20. Please help us eat!
341	True	a	"Hey all, I am in a real rough patch. Hopefully for only another week or two. Basically my story is I was laid off a month and a half ago. I had a little bit of cash and my unemployment so everything was looking not great but at least ok. Well an employer from last fall is contesting the fact that they should have to contribute to my unemployment. I had the phone hearing, I know I am in the right, I got a w2 from them with taxes taken out. But until the final call is made, my unemployment checks are being withheld. It has been 2 weeks now, well 3 unemployment checks. I have been steadily looking for work. My phone got shut off the other day and I had to use $80 of my last $100 to pay it so I can receive phone interviews.   I bought some ramen and have been eating it for most of my meals for the past week now, my Thanksgiving dinner looks like more of the same.  I would really like some protein, something tasty and feel full again after a meal.  I live in Chicago, IL which has a million and a half great pizza joints but I am by no means picky, just hungry. Could anyone help a guy out? Once I find a job and back on my feet I would be more than happy to ""pizza it forward"" or pay you back. Thanks reddit."
342	False	a	I am currently broke and working full-time, I am hungry and Dont get paid till Friday, If you could help i would appreciate it. I live in Springfield Mo. 
343	False	a	Hello everyone, my buddy wanted to help me out so he told me about this fantastic place (hence this account being made today). I am a single soldier stationed at fort campbell. Today I've noticed instead of withdrawing the normal $150 for my car payment my bank has taken out $600 dollars leaving me -$527 in my bank account. They said they'll fix it but not till they open again on Monday. Normally this would be alright because I have a meal card except this weekend my on post dining facilities have closed for the Easter weekend. I haven't eaten since breakfast on Friday and could really use some food. Anything would do. I don't have a car or I'd try and forage around. This is literally my last option at this point.  If you want proof of the bank account I can send you a picture, if you can tell me how to take a screen cap of my phone (my only internet access).  Again thank you, and if you don't trust a new account I fully understand I'm just desperate.
344	False	a	The boyf &amp; I have about $15 until Thursday, which has to be put towards gas for getting to work. I am having a crap time lately and especially today I could really use some kindness and food. My dream would be pizza from my favorite local place, two because the boyf is not a veggie person, but let's be honest...I'd take anything. 
345	False	a	Have officially used up all my gas trying to find a job as of today, and the only thing in my kitchen is a loaf of old bread. Paying forward pizza will be at the top of my to do list, but nothing is expected seeing all the help going out to Boston:]  &lt;3
346	False	a	Trying to save a couple of bucks by not going anywhere cool for spring break, and missing home (which is in California, and I'm in Pittsburgh). Pizza would be pretty cool, just thought I'd ask!
347	True	a	Work is horrendus. Not only that, but that stupid time between school ending and work picking up means i have zero cash. You guys seem kinda awesome. this'd be an interesting first reddit! X) Thanks even if you just read this X3
348	False	a	My boyfriend and I are moving to a new neighborhood and this is our last night in our current house. We've got almost everything moved, and are consequently very broke and have been munching on Triscuits, as we aren't able to go food shopping until Friday. A large pizza would set us up for today and tomorrow!  We were thinking about what to do for our tummies and I remembered: Random Acts of Pizza! I've never done this before so I'm pretty excited. PM me for more info. I will send you a picture of us with the pizza and one of our cat Sid the Squid doing something *very* silly. One does not regret pictures of Sid the Squid.
349	False	a	Ok, first of all, I just made this account, A really good friend of mine suggested that I might be able to find some help out today.  i'm 4 hours away from my wife and daughter, because of my job.  I don't get paid any kind of money until tomorrow.  I Would love to have a pizza, I'm in a place i don't know anyway, and i'm only here for work.  I work outside all day long, and i'm starving!  if someone could help me out, I will gladly return the favor when i get my paycheck.  i'm just tryin to get some help today. thanks so much!
350	False	a	I've never done this before, sorry if I'm breaking some rules, though I'm pretty sure I got it all correct.  My 3 year old daughter never really asks for specific meals, so I was surprised that she asked for pizza this morning. I've already done our shopping, and I don't have the supplies to make any, and our food budget is depleted.    Anyone out there feel like making a family's night? We're a family of four, though the little one is only 16 months old, so he doesn't eat THAT much :-)  Got a verification code if that is required.   Thanks a ton for reading!  Edit: Fulfilled! Thanks to /u/DiscontentedFairy!
351	False	a	Braces are expensive, and I got them very late (18 currently). So I'd love to have something solid I can actually eat while feeling better about myself. Por favor?  
352	False	a	I was expecting to see a dramatic increase in my checking account at midnight…no joy. Anyone want to be a kind soul and loan a recent college grad a pizza?
353	False	a	Hi, I'm a retired Army Sargeant going through a tough time. I need help feeding my family this evening and if anyone can help I'll be gladly appreciated. Thanks for reading this hope someone can help us out.
354	False	a	I have a part time job but Pizza Hut (ironic?) Corporate is forcing our store to give less and less hours; I only got around 13 this week. So any offers with pizza hut and I get a 20% discount (I think so, they took our 50% break discount so I don't know if I still get the 20% one). To see my girlfriend costs 150 dollars in gas to pick up and drop her off back at her house. Kinda want the cheesy bites pizza because my co-workers get pissed off every time someone orders one! XD Seriously though they are a huge pain to make...Oh! I also have to save all of my money because I may be homeless/living in my girlfriends closet soon... :(  EDIT: I should add today has been a really depressing day, and frozen chicken isn't exactly comfort food  EDIT2: I actually don't like pizza hut pizza all that much, at least not compared to dominos  Any pizza would be appreciated!
355	False	a	Hello fellow redditors things have been tough but I know they will get better eventually. Was wondering if a kind and thoughtful soul could help a family of 5 with a decent meal this Friday evening. Food is almost nil around here and will not be able to buy any until Monday. There are 5 of us. 2 adults, and 3 children if anyone can help. We have a pizza hut that is not too far from the house so an egift card would be perfect. I want to thank you all so much for reading my post.   ((Hugs))
356	False	a	Spent all of our money for food on rent. Only one of us is working and we have a lil one to feed too. First timers, please help if you can, GOD bless.
357	False	a	Just an average engineering student doing the full load summer class thing. My food stores have been reduced to a few cans of vegetables, oatmeal, and coffee. I've had a pretty rough week and could use some pizza + faith in humanity to help me power through finals this week. If anyone out there is kind enough to indulge me I would be very grateful. :)  Oh yeah, I'm in northern Minnesota
358	False	a	Hi! I've had a crappy pay period. Got paid today and poof, it's gone. I would dance with glee if someone gave me a pizza for me and one cat (she will get one pepperoni, which she will beg for, but then lose interest once I give it to her.) Anyone care to build me a smile?
359	False	a	I'm a college student with a midterm worth 30% of my grade tomorrow morning as well as two papers due. It looks like I'll be spending the whole night in the library working, and I could really go for some pizza. I am located in Wisconsin (USA) and Papa Johns is located on campus. If anyone would be willing to donate a pizza, I'd really appreciate it! 
360	False	a	Hey guys. I hate to ask for hep but Im kinda going through a rough time atm. I'm a single mom with an 8 year old autistic son named Logan. I've been struggling lately since I got laid off from my last job and we are literaly out of food now. I am starting a part time job tomorrow morning but it'll be 3 weeks before I'll receive my first paycheck and I'm currently awaiting results on my food stamp application. If anyone could please help us out with a pizza tonight it'd be a huge huge blessing, ty so much!
361	False	a	Trying to hang, but severe stomach pangs are making it hard, and our jester pockets are, alas, empty.
362	False	a	I don't have much in the cupboards, I have no transport and it's pouring down with rain that won't stop for a few days... A Random Act of Pizza would be like a blessing from above! (geographically speaking, America appears to be 'above' New Zealand on the world map :P)
363	False	a	so I get off in an hour of posting this and still have a ton of things to do around the house, I have no idea when she will be home, but I would love to have something there for both of us to be able to eat. If anyone would like to help us out I would be grateful!
364	False	a	Just started a new job but all my remaining money was put into my gas tank. Just need some food to get me through until payday. You would be helping out a military member in need. =) Please and thank you!
365	False	a	Dear reddit:  I am a long time follower but have only recently just registered. A long story short is I am fucked!!! I am a 30 year old male from St.Catharines, Ontario (Neil Peart, Linda Evangelista, Paul Bernardo, Karla Homolka, Dave Thomas (SCTV), Alexisonfire, The Trews, etc, etc) who was evicted as of today and my place to live just fell through! I have no where to live so as soon as the sheriff shows up I'm homeless and though I have $40 on me I  want to save it incase I need a ghetto hotel room for me and my girl.  A little back story here, as I feel it's needed to shed some light as how I got to this point; when I moved into this place I was working steady overtime in sales but got laid off soon after I moved here. Not to worry I quickly found full time work, working midnight shift for a company called CCSI which had a contract to clean the New Food Classics plant here in St.Catharines. I have worked since I was 16 and am now 30 so no work was driving me nuts so I took first job I could get.  The job itself wasn't bad but the amount of corners they cut was very noticable. My very first day of work they told me the safety video was broken so I would have to do the training in a few days... I didn't get training until after I called Ministry Of Labor (Ontario) which was after I was already injured, but I I'll speak about this later.   I did the work no problem and was quickly promoted within 2 weeks, though that was partly due to the high turnover there as most people hated the job and quit.  While working there I requested training weekly with my manager to which he would reply some excuse about the dvd still being broken or doing it next week. Not wanting to be a bitch I kept working despite my concerns.  Fast forward a few weeks and we have an inspection from CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency)so everything has to be tip top. One of the duties when CFIA comes apparently was the ceilings of the plant had to be squeegeed dry as to not have any condensation from the cleaning drip into the frozen foods that were being made there (ie; burgers, ribetts).  While I was squeegeeing the cook room while my co-workers were out smoking, not working, I spent 2 and a half hrs doing it myself with a squeegee on the end of a 20 ft pole. Afterwards I couldn't move my neck without severe pain and later after my shift I couldn't sit in a chair without severe pain. I tried to sleep as it was the end of a midnight shift but my muscles would spasm to the point I couldn't sleep. I then called TeleHealth and they advised I go to a walk in clinic.  There I was diagnosed with a sprain of the left and right traps and lats, I think, traps for sure though.and sent for 3 months of physio due to the severity of the sprain. I did the entire 3 months but still no relief but the entire time my pysiotherapist is telling me there is something more there,  A month later Im at a hospital with insane back pain after vaccuming which I hadnt done since injury and I get x-rays. Doctor at hospital I need to see family doctor and have MRI.  See family doctor a month later, do some tests and he sends me for MRI. MRI results come back a month and half later. 2 herniated discs, spinal stenosis and degenerative bone disease caused by injury at work. Prognosis: No bending, No lifting, No twisting... FOR LIFE!  July 4th I see a neurologist for an EMG to determine whether I have back surgery but I have already been told they can't fix my back it will only be if it can improve my quality of life.  Oh and because WSIB says my back should be healed because its only a back sprain that takes 3 months to heal, I am all better, I have no income, no food, am being evicted as of today (June 25th) for back rent 3 months ($3300) but on the bright side I do have a lawyer but it's taking forever and welfare is not enough!!  Can reddit help with a pizza for what may be my last night indoors for a while?   I can prove anything I just dont have a scanner so I would have to take a photo with cell and upload it.    
366	False	a	Wife &amp; I are splitting up for good, she has gone for the weekend to spend time with some of her family for a bit.  Using a throwaway because we haven't notified most of our friends &amp; family yet of our situation, and I know a few people know my primary reedit account.  It's an amicable split, but that doesn't make it instantly easy, either.  That all being said, it's not only rough emotionally, but selling a house is rough (especially with the nature of the economy and us not being at a point where we were expecting to sell).  I could probably spare the $10 for a small or medium pizza, but I'm *really* trying to save every penny to help with all the costs.  Plus, right now, a lot of things just feel like it sucks.  A little more right now since I'm in this house by myself.  If anyone thinks I'm a troll/scammer, I'd be happy to give you the name of my primary reddit name in private and verify through there and/or through the verification system.  FYI, I'm in the U.S., if that matters to anyone.  Thanks, guys and gals.
367	False	a	Hi there. My name is Naru, and quite frankly, I'm really, really hungry. I just lost my job last week, so I have no money. :( I would really appreciate a pizza, even just a small one. Thank you for your time.
368	False	a	"I know sappy stories are sometimes made-up or used to take advantage of people.  I hate to admit it, but this sappy story is true.  Today, my wife and I lost our youngest cat Tula to liver failure (that is assumed, waiting on the official results).  We rescued her 2 years ago after a fox attack her in the wild.  The vet was going to put her asleep , but my wife, the lover of most living creatures convinced me to take her in.  This week she refused food and eventually last evening passed away.  My wife did get to see her Thursday, but she looked ""vacant"".  We both agreed we would donate her to the local university for them to perform the autopsy and possibly see what caused her liver to fail.  I am asking for her for some pizza from the reddit community.  This is really for my wife because of the attachment that she had with her.  I can provide verification of Tula and the autopsy (when we get it).  But Pizza and bread sticks would cheer up my wife.  Thanks for at least reading this.  I will pay it forward sometime soon down the road.    **EDIT**  As promised here are photos of Tula.    http://imgur.com/acXQSIY http://imgur.com/r7FaJfG"
369	False	a	Been applying to jobs for the last two weeks with no luck yet. I would love a pizza to boost my spirits.
370	True	a	Title pretty much says it all, would love a pizza to share amongst my roommates while we study!
371	True	a	So ya i posted in that offer thread but too late i guess. More details there..id link but im shit at phone redditing...tldr is unemployed veteran student waiting for va to unfuck themselves and pay me..just had enough for rent but crackhead roommate spent electric bill money on crack so they shut power off yesterday. Been eating potatoes for almost 2 weeks. Would kill a puppy for an mre let alone a hot pizza. If anyone wants to help ill pay it forward when im able.
372	True	a	with pizza.  ehh??   Watching Star Trek with the person i'm going to marry, have both been up for 24 hours, and are getting really sick of oatmeal... haha so if anyone has a spare pizza laying around we'd be much obliged...the end. 
373	True	a	Today is our 4th wedding anniversary! We don't get paid until next Friday and the money we had set aside for a nice dinner tonight begrudgingly went to various bills and gas in the last few days. She thought this subreddit was an awesome idea when I told her about it and I'd love to surprise her with pizza as opposed to the now planned spaghetti. We're in Florida, btw.  edit: [Pizza received!](http://i.imgur.com/5dcGb.jpg) My wife went from confused to angry to amazed hilariously fast. Thanks to MsFit for making our anniversary dinner delicious and awesome.
374	False	a	"4 18-20 yr olds living off of one of our roommates BF's mom's shitty frozen diet foods. We could really use some ""real"" food. Only one of use has a real job, 2 work part time and barely make enough for rent, and the fourth (me) is unemployed, and has officially run out of money."
375	True	a	I'm a college student, so I don't have much money, and I'm home (in Texas, if that's important) over Christmas break. But I've been sick this whole week. My whole family is gone to work or school and I don't have much energy for making food. A small pizza, even just bread sticks, would be nice. Thanks for reading this :)
376	False	a	hey guys:  I love this sub. I think it's great. (Except the sob stories. I miss when this place was fun!) Anywho, I've given a pizza out before so thought I would try my luck at getting one. My friend, who lives an hour away and our schedules do not let us see each other too much, decided to come down and visit me for the night! I would love to be able to be a good host and order her a pizza to go with some beer!  Again, no sob story. Just looking to share a pizza with an old friend :)
377	True	a	fridge is looking pretty fucking shabby, will prove. I was fucked by a previous employer out of $3,000, now broke as shit with little food until at least Monday when i have a phone interview for food stamps but i've been denied before because of my past drug related crimes and how California laws are. You can rape and murder someone in California, get out of prison, and get food stamps, but you're fucked if you sell someone weed once. I know that won't get me much pity but I could really care less about that, i just want pizza and i heard this was the place for that......
378	True	a	I hope I posted the title correctly. I've been unemployed for most of the year, and I will be starting a new job in 2 weeks. I'm very excited about this new position, however I won't be receiving my first check for another month. My son has been my rock through it all and he continues to grow into a wonderful young man. I know this pizza would mean the world to him as it would be a vast improvement from what we've been eating. Would anyone out there be willing to help me surprise my son with a good meal? Please consider us. Thank you.
379	False	a	I'm broke hungry spent all my money on rent and power.and don get paid till Monday will pay it forward monday
380	True	a	~~Reddit has given me a lot lately, and I am very thankful. So if you are going to choose between me and someone that needs it more, go with someone else. I have a 6 person family - me, husband, and kids 10, 5, 4, and turning 2 next month - and with me having to buy the parts for a new computer (I make my living online) and trying to buy xmas presents, we aren't going to be able to eat anything that isn't homemade for awhile. I normally make pizza myself, but we're out of cheese. My 4 year old has asked me every morning for the past 3 days if we can have pizza for dinner...~~  Someone that wishes to remain anonymous sent me some pizza. Thanks so much!!
381	False	a	I'm a full time college student at the University of South Carolina. I've got lots of homework tonight and would love to get hooked up with a pie! 
382	False	a	Payday is on Friday but until then we could use a random act of zza. The fridge is looking a little barren... (please excuse my kitchen floor, it needs to be replaced badly) http://i.imgur.com/Q4iAJ.jpg
383	False	a	My wife just lost her job, and her medication is failing her bipolar. I've just gotten a crappy grade on yet another test in managerial accounting. Its days like these that keep kicking you in the balls. A pepperoni and sausage pizza would make life so much better.  EDIT: Just found out that students don't qualify for food stamps. Stupidest. rule. ever.
384	False	a	"I'm stuck dogsitting at the last minute tonite with no (human) food, and I can't walk this dog to the store (he's trying to eat everyone he sees) and I can't leave him here, because I have ""no pets"" on my lease, and he will start HOWLING every time I leave...help!! I'm so hungry, this is insane!!!"
385	False	a	So this is what happened (long story short)! My girlfriend rang me yesterday and said we needed to sort things out, went to meet her and she blurted out how she hasn't been happy for a while and that i'm not the same guy I used to be - dunno how i'm gonna get through this one, I loved her to bits.  To top it all off I don't get paid till friday and even then It will be a tiny amount, I don't do many shifts because I suffer from depression, all money goes on living and its never enough - some pizza would really perk me up right now in this dark times.  George
386	False	a	Hey guys my name is Dwight I live in Kula, Hawaii and would like to have some pizza tonight or sometime this week. Last Friday I found out my dad's house which I live at is being foreclosed on. I didn't even know that that was going to happen. I'm pretty broke and I would really like a pizza if you guys are ok with giving me one. Ask me anything and thanks you guys are awesome! Edit: Just got a gift card from Paulinator. Thank you all so Much!
387	False	a	This is the last night that all of my friends will be together for Friday Night Magic.  Four out out of the five will be leaving town to either go to college or another state.  I am trying to make this the best night I can with very little money, I just dropped 1000 for car repair.  A  simple cheese would work.  Many thanks to anyone that looks, and everyone else that considers, you are awesome!  I will repay the favor to someone else in the future!
388	False	a	My gf and I had a little bit of a crisis lately (car accident) which used up all of our money. We get paid tomorrow, but we've barely been eating this past week. We would love a hot pizza to tide us over! :)  Location: Virginia, USA (thanks Tarable!)
389	False	a	So I've never posted in RAOP before but a friend suggested I come here. Yesterday a pair of pits attacked me and my dog while walking around my neighborhood and I just paid off the vet and hospital bills this morning. It really has left me with $6.88 and means I have no money to eat for a week. I'm going to try and find a way to get food for the meantime (food pantry perhaps?) but after the stress a pizza would be amazing.  If you are willing to help me make it through this week with offers of pizza until I get paid, every single pizza will be paid forward after pay day.  This is Indiana:  * http://imgur.com/IP70c * http://imgur.com/xIAiv * http://imgur.com/smJNf * http://imgur.com/x5dmS * http://imgur.com/rgmFX  Photos of bill available if that kind of thing is needed. I have a verification code to give as well. This is my first time ever here so, apologizes if I've broken a rule I didn't see.  ***P.S. To any one out there considering getting an pitbull terrier THIS SHOULD IN NO WAY AFFECT YOUR DECISION.*** Indiana is part pit and pits are absolutely lovely creatures. The owner trained them for defense and fighting then let them get loose. I am already broken up about them getting destroyed. Responsible and loving dog owners know that pits are wonderful.
390	False	a	It's 4/20, I'm in Ithaca NY, and I just smoked an 8 bowl session with 12 of my friends and an awesome mom, so I have pretty serious munchies but no food and would be very grateful for the donation of a plain pizza. Happy holidays fellow stoners. 
391	False	a	Wabash, Indiana. Family is away so i'm sitting at home browsing Reddit and I get hungry. Pizza sounds glorious!
392	False	a	Im a 15 y/o babysitting my sisters kids and I can make them some noodles but I was clumsy and dropped the sauce on the floor so they would have to eat them plain which sucks. The only place to get pizza nearby is Dominos but its not within walking distance so I cant get them anything since I dont have enough cash to pay for delivery and a tip. If anyone could help us out we'd consider ourselves blessed. Thanks.
393	False	a	"Ohhh that tense wait for blood test results, at first 6 months apart.  Brutal.  Even after being declared Cancer free, the nagging worry of a return just festers inside of you.  I finally made it to only having one test a year, and no more nightmarish CAT scans. Today was my first yearly result call.   You expect anything but good new, because you prep yourself for worst thing he could possibly say.  You brace yourself in defense of it, for weeks after they draw the blood from your veins.  It builds and builds up until that call.  And then it comes.  That intolerable small talk when the Doctor first gets on the line.  It's a pleasant exchange, though the entire time, you're mind is screaming ""SAY IT, SAY IT DAMN YOU, WHAT DID THE BLOOD LOOK LIKE!?  YOU SAVED MY LIFE BUT I WILL LOSE IT IF WE TALK ABOUT MY COLLEGE OR THE WEATHER FOR ANOTHER MOMENT!"".      ""No changes, which is a good thing"".  Deafening relief.  The world just somehow looks better after this call, it smells better, everything is vivid, clearer, more alive.  Please help me with a celebration meal worthy of this feeling.  My favorite pizza, I do not have the funds for it.  I can think of nothing else right now that I would enoy more than a simple Large Bacon Pineapple Pizza from Dominoes with BBQ sauce instead of marinara.  If it was a wild animal I would hunt it with my instincts and wits alone.  But alas.  If you see fit I thank you for any help you may give."
394	False	a	My wallet got stolen two weeks ago and due to complications with my address can't get my new card until friday. Bank was closed all weekend and burned through all my reserve 20p noodles.  Haven't had anything today and need to walk over 4km tomorrow (edit: to the bank in town) because cant afford the bus, would appreciate the energy boost
395	False	a	I'm a student it's my first day back and I'm broke I'm in the uk can I get a pizza?  haven't heard of this site before but i'm starving and i've run out of food in my house, don't know how this works so if someone could help out i'll love you forever and possibly name my first born after you
396	False	a	So, i'm a student with no summer job and currently no money either. I'm returning to school tomorrow (free food!) but at the moment I got nothing to eat. I can offer verification or whatever info you need.  I suppose omething like pizza-online would work? Thanks in advance!
397	False	a	Hi RAOP'ers!  I go to school part time and work full time.  My night class doesn't interfere with my work hours but my daytime class is in the next town over.  Since I work full time and my daytime class takes up a few hours on 2 days of my 8-5 schedule, I use my lunch hours to go to class.  That leaves me with no way to leave work to get anything or go home to fix lunch (which is all I can afford atm :).    So dumb poor me left the house this morning with no food for lunch and I can't afford to order anything.  Any pie for poor forgetful me? :)
398	False	a	First time poster here. I get paid tomorrow and would like to treat my family to pizza tonight for being patient.  Things are slim and I think they would really appreciate it...I know I would. Thanks a bunch in advance.   
399	False	a	"So yeah... employer just told me to be packed up and out of here in two weeks this past Friday.  I'm backed up on my finances because of kidney stones that were so painful that I couldn't work a full 40 for a few weeks.  My job has no benefits and I couldn't afford to go to the doctor, so I manned up and gritted my teeth through it without awesome drugs...      Now my power, internet(which I'm downgrading soon) and TV service(i'm cutting the cord as soon as this stupid contract is gone), cell phone bills(on contract so nothing I can do here) are all late.  I've been late on my car payment twice in the past 5 months.  I can't afford to pay any of them right now because my rent is coming due, and if I don't pay that on time they charge a $50 late fee plus $10 for every additional day late.  I also need gas, and my car insurance is going to be due in full soon.  And I have a huge student loan in my mother's name with myself co-signed that I haven't been able to make the payment on for a few months... so I'm just hurting her.    I live alone and haven't really made many friends since I moved to this state.  I've been begging for part time jobs for over a year and no one is hiring me.  Now I'm close to being unemployed and my employer(staffing firm) hasn't found me a replacement yet.      I'm subsisting on Ramen, buttered pasta, the cheapest hot dogs I can find, and any other sale items I can find for less than $1 per dinner, around .50-.75 for lunch, and I don't even eat breakfast.      Before the troubles started I loved that new Dominos pan pizza.  I'm a cynical, pissed off, ""hates everything"" manic depressive who doesn't like to smile.  But that stuff always puts a smile on my face.         I'm going to join this sub, and as soon as I can I will return the gesture if someone can help me feel good again for a little bit before I start looking for stuff in my apartment to sell to pay these stupid bills.      If you live in the area I would be happy to try to help you with any technology issues that you may be having in return."
400	True	a	I'll be honest, there are other people here who probably deserve a pizza more than I do, but at the moment, a pizza sounds really good. As background, I'm a college student living in Hesperia, CA (AKA: One of the most boring regions of California), who is currently composing a sonnet for his Creative Writing class. I've been craving pizza for the past few days, but I haven't been able to buy any because of the financial aid office holding out on student grants/loans. A recent switch to a college debit card system has pretty much put a lot of people's money in limbo for the time being. This has been annoying, to say the least, since I have books to buy, a gas tank to fill, and an oil leak to fix as well.  Right now, I would only have my gratitude to offer as thanks. Anything would be appreciated.
401	True	a	This is just a shot in the dark, but does anyone want to buy my husband and I some pizza for our wedding anniversary? 
402	False	a	No sob story here, just two guys hanging out plaing some NHL 12, looking to have a pizza. I've been a member for a bit now and will return the favour next weekend!
403	False	a	Finally getting around to having a night to myself (no gf) and video games. Little did I know that we haven't gone food shopping in over a week and neither of us gets paid until this friday.  Would definitely appreciate it and have no problem returning the favor or paying it forward once i can afford it :) 
404	False	a	It's been too long, I'll take anything! 
405	True	a	I hope it's okay to request on behalf of others. My friend in Aberystwyth has several thousand words to write tonight, but she's got no money, ran out of rice and lentils yesterday, and doesn't get her student loan until tomorrow.  I'd buy her something myself but I'm also out of money, and I live in Cardiff so I can't bring her food.  She'd be very grateful for a pizza, and I'll pay it forward when I can.
406	True	a	I know this is a new acct willing to do whatever to prove not a troll. e-mail is irishred1825@hotmail. I have athritis in my spine and neck. my wife works full time and takes online classes in the evening and we take care of a 2 year old. some food besides mac and cheese would be fantastic.
407	True	a	Fulfilled! Thank you Paisley8827! From the bottom of our hearts (and bellies)!  The money: We've got a negative bank account, my wife is due two payments from her company (she's a freelancer for a subsidiary of Penguin Books), and both of our parents have already helped us financially. We've got a 2nd account with about 30 bucks in it to last us until Tuesday.   If it were just she and I, we could scrounge. We've both been hungry before. But it isn't just us, we've got an eternally hungry 7year old, and a 1 year old who might be the worlds largest importer of milk.  I know it reads like a sob story, but it isn't. Normally things are good, and they'll be good again soon, but right now the stress of how to feed everyone is very, very taxing. Hell, starting Monday I'll be making my twice-a-week trips to the local Talecris Plasma center for the extra cash.  So, all that being said, would someone be willing to help us out tonight?  edit: We're in Pensacola, Fl for what it's worth.
408	False	a	Unexpected dental work has tightened our family of four's budget this week and there's not much left to buy groceries. If anyone could spare a pizza, we would greatly appreciate it.  Forgot to add location to the thread title: Central Ohio
409	True	a	Got caught up in some debts that have kept me from getting food for the past month, leaving me with whatever I've had in my cabinet, which is almost at its end. I finally get paid next Friday, and was hoping to get some food for tonight
410	False	a	Happy Veterans Day! I'd like to make a request that someone out there make Ramen illegal. My family and I have eaten nothing but ramen for a week and it has slowly but surely drained everyone in my household. We try dressing it up with canned sauce, but it's still really bad. Can you help a brotha out with something that doesn't taste like wet cardboard tonight? My wife, kids, and myself would appreciate the kind gesture. My kids can also make you a you tube video if you like laughing at silly things. Nothing too graphic or obscene (they're 10 and 12), but I'm sure they can make you a funny video of just about whatever you like within reason. (Daddy has to approve of the theme.)  If you can't help, thank you for checking out my post. I was joking about ramen being a crime - We are thankful to have it, but wish we could have something different. Thank you and hope ya'll enjoy your Friday. 
411	False	a	Fact is, no food in house. We requested a local Food Bank provide some and have to wait several days. Alas, empty stomach is now.  First time asking help here, insofar right now because things escalated. I am looking for/without work temporarily, my roommate got laid off yesterday.  Hundredthoughts of please and thank you.
412	True	a	It's my Dalmatian's birthday. He's 13 years old, and loooooves pizza bones (crust). Would anyone like to make his birthday pizzariffic?  Edited to add:  Who can say no to this face?  http://i.imgur.com/Mepk60f.jpg
413	False	a	We've just moved into our new house for our second year of uni and we have NO money until our loan comes through in October! Please help us all we have in the house is bread!
414	True	a	After spending two and a half months unemployed, the universe seemed to have the BEST sense of humour, and I landed three interviews today (two face-to-face, one over the phone). I absolutely NAILED them, and feeling like next week I'm going to have jobs fighting over me. (Longer success story [here.](http://redd.it/ojvu1)) So I'm feeling pretty damn good. But you know what would make me fly on absolute Cloud 9 right now? A good ol' pizza!  First time asking.
415	False	a	Okay guys so I'm kind of in the mood for some pizza, but I'd rather buy one for someone else! And I'm in an extra good mood today so I want to give two Redditors down on their luck some pizza today, and would also like some for myself. So if some lovely person would like to give me a pie, I will give two redditors of their choice a pie!  Edit: I'm all used up for my offers for now. But I'm still taking an offer for some pizza myself if some kind soul would oblige:)
416	True	a	I will receive my second paycheck at my new job (recent graduate) on the 10th! It's so close! But my last paycheck was on June 25 and all of that went to rent so we had to make $40 from my future husband's paycheck last us for groceries. I went shopping on June 29, but we have run out of all the food I bought. We would really love a pizza to hold us over today until my paycheck comes in.
417	False	a	Hello, me and my white best friend are sitting here dreaming about the scrumptiousness of melted cheese amongst risen bread. My friend and me are dreaming of little animals being murdered to be the topping upon our delicious oasis.  Okay, two broke seniors hanging out empty house, no food, no parents to give food. And we just got done mowing two senior citizens' lawns if it makes any difference. Thanks for the help
418	False	a	I feel weird asking, but my family would really enjoy a pizza. My parents lost their jobs after the devastating tornado here in Joplin. We currently have other family members living with us that lost everything. We have 12 people living here right now and were living off can goods and pasta or whatever is given to us. We would grately appriciate a special gift like this..  &lt;3 God bless Joplin &lt;3 
419	False	a	I've been in school for a few weeks and my food stores are running low, and can't be filled up again until my loans come in. If somebody can gift me a pizza today I will 'today you, tomorrow me' this weekend!
420	True	a	 I dont want to eat from the public park trash. Please we are sitting here anticipating eating.    Dont worry, the dog eats the cans i bought for him. Please someone help us, im on the verge of tears. We are homeless and our ebt does not come in until next week. I landed a job interview for monday, but dont want to celebrate with starvation. Please someone care.
421	False	a	I've never done this before, so I'm not sure if I'm even doing it right. 
422	False	a	Hey, my roommate and I are running low on cash. He lost his job last week and I had to pay his month's rent, and I'm going to have to until he finds another job. If someone could help us out with a pizza that would be great!  Thanks!
423	False	a	 If anyone would be the savior of our stomachs we would love you forever and we would draw you something on MS Paint &lt;3
424	False	a	I'm a student living in Boston and I've been terribly sick for the last couple of days. Cold stuff, nothing huge but it's made me miss class which is very annoying.  Being feverish and cold-stricken I'd like to turn the radiator on but the landlord insists on not turning the boiler on until late October. This is New England where things get super cold super fast. I am one of those things and the blankets aren't cutting it. :/  Because of the first couple weeks of classes, I haven't had a chance to grocery shop extensively, only buying fruits and cereal and bread what have you. I've now exhausted all of that. Now I'm out of money too, so I can't even get take out.  I do have money put away for college, but my mother back home insists on regulating it for me. She's probably right to do so, however her boyfriend surprised her with a trip to the carribean. Meaning, now I need money from my account, but can't have it transfered because she is away.  Today's just a shit day: I'm sick, I'm cold, and my money is just out of reach.  May I please have a pizza so I can lay on it to stay warm/eat it while sobbing?
425	False	a	Pretty much as I said, pizza would be an awesome way to make this first week of school easier and there is no way I could possibly swing it. PM me if you are feeling awesome.  For my fellow students; good luck studying, we are already two days down. 
426	False	a	This is a throwaway account, but I'll provide my regular account to anyone who asks for it over PM. It's just that I have a friend who's a redditor and I'd rather she not know of my predicament :)  Basically I've been eating ramen and macaroni and cheese for the past week because I have 3 cents in the bank. The reason for *that* is that I forgot that my student loan payment hadn't already been taken out of my account and spent the money on some pillowcases, pillows, and sheets instead of on groceries like I should have.  Anyway, I'm not going to starve by any means, but I've run out of macaroni and cheese (and milk) so all I have til Thursday when I get paid is ramen. Location is eastern NY state.
427	True	a	I live in a small house with my Grandma and my Boyfriend, He is visiting from Ireland and he is leaving in 5 days. My gramma has been low on work, and shes 58 and I haven't found a job yet. Finally being of age to get a job i figured it would be easy but in this economy its not.  I'm NOT starving, but I am hungry for that warm cheesy pepperoni taste of pizza straight from the oven. I've Mowed lawns around my neighborhood to put food in my house and i'm running low on cash. Food is scarce and i have to wait till my grandmas next pay day for gas. Please help me and my boyfriend and grandma have a delicious dinner tonight. It would be much appreciated.   Even if i and my family don't get one, when i get a job i will be sure to help others here. 
428	False	a	I really want pizza, but the only offer I have is a 48 hour all access pass to Crunchyroll. I have 3 that are unused.   Plus, OSU (OHio State) is playing today and Pizza would be the prefect compliment to watching them beat Florida.
429	False	a	I'm not gonna bore y'all with some long sob story, but basically it's gonna be a looong loooong time before I can afford a pizza again, and maybe I'm just cynical but I think it's amazing people would be so generous and when I've got a bit of cash I look forward to being able to make someones day.  So if anyone would be so kind to send me a wee pizza over, I would be so thrilled :)  EDIT: Some proof of my skint-ness! http://imgur.com/s5pKxmJ
430	True	a	hey raop...i already rec'd the hookup earlier last week before moving.  i was hoping that someone out there could hook up another pizza tonight.  we moved all weekend, and are tapped out until snap benefits hit on the 9th.  after i a job i'll be glad to pay it back or pay it forward.  i need to feed myself, my girlfriend, and of course the two cats love scraps of ham off the pizza.  edit: oh yeah i forgot, western ky here!  help a hillbilly out, ya'll!  UPDATE: om nom!  thanks to sbrinkley1104 me and mine are eating hot fresh pizza tonight!  thanks ya'll
431	True	a	I work as a security guard at a corporate building with 24/7 security. I work today, 2 to 10 pm central time, in an empty building and tomorrow in an empty building. I am living pay check to pay check so a pizza thrown in as a replacement my PB&amp;J sandwiches would be very appreciated! 
432	False	a	Starving college student who's eaten frozen fish-sticks for the past few days and just looking for a good meal!  In return, when money is available to me, I will buy the person a pizza.
433	False	a	Hi raop. If you couldn't tell by the username, I am broke. I have about 50 dollars to my name to last me until August 30th. If you're wondering why this is a throwaway, it's because I have family who know my main username and I don't want them alarmed at my current situation.  I was recently let go from my primary job and have about 12 to 16 hours coming in from part time work when I can get it. On top of that shitty predicament my car sprung a leak in it's cooling system and until an acquaintance can get to my city to help me do repairs i'm reliant on bumming rides off of people to get to/from work.  Suffice it to say a little pizza would go a long way for me while I try to get back on my feet. [Here is the only thing I can think to provide as far as proof](http://i.imgur.com/trd9c.jpg). Not really sure if there is something I am supposed to do otherwise, I just found out this subreddit existed a few days ago.
434	False	a	Left my GF of two years and moved into a new place, but spent most of my paycheck paying the first months rent. Have less than $15 to my name. Friend was supposed to help me with groceries, but she hasn't received the money from her loan yet, so I'm out of luck until then, or until my next paycheck, which is the friday after next, nearly two weeks away.   I was hoping someone could help me out, and in return I will mail you one of my [prints](http://imgur.com/a/S5q1Y) when I am financially able. The print would be of your choice. 
435	False	a	Exactly as the title says. Belt is tightened, but ramen sounds ghastly. Will be sure to pay it forward next month.
436	False	a	Hello reddit,  Here's our story.  We're at a friend's house in (essentially) the middle of nowhere. We've come down to stay for a few days, and none of us have cars, so we're essentially stuck food free.  Now, here's the tricky part. The two people we are staying with are currently having 'a relationship tiff'. Essentially they've left us downstairs, post several joints, and we have absolutely no food, and a tremendous, burning desire for it.  We're sat desperately hoping they aren't breaking up, as this would be seriously uncool whilst high, and it would firmly delay our chance to eat pizza.  Thank you.
437	False	a	We'll gladly pay this forward but in the meantime we're hungry and were wondering if RAOP could help us out. :)
438	True	a	I've been babysitting my youger siblings a lot recently and let's just say they're tired of Top Ramen. I feel bad for them and mom can't go grocery store just yet. I'm an avid watcher of this subreddit and send thanks to those who are generous to others. I get paid next week and would love to help out someone else who is need of food. I'd be much appriciative and will most definently return the favor. Thank you people of Reddit!
439	False	a	Will pay it forward asap.
440	False	a	Finally, Today after about 6 months, our foster children are here! We are so excited. We now have 4 children ( 3 foster and 1 Biological) After spending time with them, clothes shopping and etc, We are totally beat. Get this THEY HAVE NEVER had pizza! We'd like to treat the whole family for pizza, but from shopping , we're all monied out! Until our next paycheck. If anyone wants to share this moment with us, it would be awesome and we will TOTALLY return the favor as SOON as we can.! I see that people offer pictures. We will send some of our FOUR children ( it makes me so happy to say that) Enjoying that yummy pizza. We are located in Midwest City, Ok and have a papa johns right down the street.! Pepperoni is always a favorite. We have 4 kids, plus me and my husband! Like I said we will return the favor, we are just so happy for our blessings and shocked they have never had an american favorite :) 
441	True	a	Me and my fiancee recently lost our home. We were paying rent but the landlord was not paying the mortgage. As a result we had no where to go. We ended up having to stay in a motel untill we can find a new place. After the room is paid for the week and the car is gassed up so My fiancee can go to work just to pay for this room, There is close to nothing left. I have found work recently, but do not start for another 3 weeks. We basically live off of what food will fit in a mini- fridge. With morale being low right now, I think a hot pizza would lift spirits. There is nothing more soothing then some hot comfort food!  And in the next few weeks I plan to buy someone a pizza myself. ... Pay it forward they say!
442	False	a	I know I am in no way original or the most deserving of a pizza, but basically, here's my story: I met a girl awhile ago. We'll refer to her as an 80's metal musician. Let's say, Dave Mustaine. Dave and I started talking over a social media site, but for vagueness, we'll say headnovel. We met in real life shortly after, and became the best of friends very fast. About 3 months into hanging out, my ex-girlfriend called me while we were hanging out at my cabin, and I got upset because the ex was saying terrible things. To rectify this, Dave thought she should kiss me, and she did. Things went from best friends to Relationship pretty fast. But Dave had a boyfriend she never saw. Literally, NEVER. He asked her out, and from then on, it was a textual relationship. Eventually, I told her she needed to decide between the two of us, but she said she didn't want to hurt him. So I cut it off. Fast forward a few months ago, she came back into my life with a different boyfriend, one she actually saw. I wanted to hang out with her again because she saw eye to eye with me on more things than last time, which was a lot. She frequents reddit and other such sites, we laugh at memes and dumb things, hate everyone that is ignorant, we appreciate good music, and are very emotional. This time, reddit, she took my virginity while she was emotionally with her new boyfriend. I didn't regret it at first. I do now. Dave was made to choose between us once more, and she chose her boyfriend yet again. But for some dumb reason, I still talked to her up until about 24 hours ago. I wanted to fix it, to wait for this girl that I thought was the girl of my dreams. I still want to fix it. But she just hurts me. All day, I've tried to act normal, like hang out with friends and such, and I just feel removed from it. I just want some comfort food and to listen to punk music and be the stereotypical heartbroken teenage boy. TL;DR girl of my dreams breaks my heart and virginity and I would like some comfort food right now.  I'll pay it forward however you ask, if I can.  Location: Message for details. Thanks. 
443	False	a	I lost my job a few weeks ago and also just ended a very bad engagement. I am a single mom with 3 kids and we really would like pizza but I have no money until my unemployment starts. If anyone could help us out it would be great.
444	False	a	Hey there, RAOP!  I'm new to this subreddit and figured I'd put up a request since I have a tough couple days ahead of me.  I have exams in both of my 400-level classes on Monday and I'd really appreciate a pizza to get me through all the dense reading I have to do! In one of my classes we're learning about altruistic behavior in humans, so a pizza gift from a random Internet stranger would be especially appropriate food for thought ;)   Have a great weekend, everybody! 
445	False	a	I just heard about this subreddit and thought it was the coolest thing ever. Like the title said, I get paid tomorrow and right now my bank account is under a dollar. I've run out of food staples and there is a domino's up the street from my house. I could go pick up a carryout order and it would really make my day better instead of living off toast or buttered noodles another day.
446	False	a	My partner and main support system is out of the country for three months. Work has been especially frustrating and I'm waiting to hear if I got into the school I want to go to. Rent and bills have emptied my accounts and while I do have food at home, (rice and beans) I'm just feeling too overwhelmed to cook.   I'm located in Portland, OR. 
447	False	a	I am requesting pizza for my family of 3 plus 1 on the way we are currently out of work barely scraping by on state assistance and any side jobs we can get our power bill is currently passed due our cupboards are running empty and we don't get any food assistance till Friday we would be greatful for your help the pizza would be a great help to our family and give us a little bit of fun in these hard times our son will be 3 in October and baby due in january
448	True	a	My fiance and I just spent the last of our money on gas, and we're hungry - willing to do stuff to make people laugh for pizza.   Located near Indianapolis, Indiana  (edited for location)
449	True	a	Cooking dinner for one is a difficult task and since I'm alone I'd love to lay on the couch, watch netflix and have a pizza. Will pay it forward on the 15th (payday.)
450	False	a	Was heading to work today when i was rear ended. Rear bumper got completely ripped off and the other driver fled the scene. Car luckily is drivable but needs some repairs[whole rear bumper :(]. Spent just about the rest of my income on ER surcharge but im free of injuries thankfully. Nerves a little rattled after all this and got the rest of the day to lay around and recover. Funds are on low until Friday and would really appreciate the help.   http://i.imgur.com/yrqlV.jpg  -- Holding it down in the ER. hah
451	False	a	me and my family struggle every day to eat because of the economy we were forced to all move together 5 of us in a two bed room apt it would be nice to have something good to eat and to have a day off from the worry of what we are going to eat today 
452	False	a	I am under no hardships. I'm just a 17-year-old kid living near Chicago, and I just think that my sister would be pleasantly surprised by a nice pizza. It's been a while since we've had to share something. ;)  Donors, if you're looking to help someone in need, look elsewhere. Although I'd like a pizza, I really don't *need* one, and there's plenty of requests on here that really do.  That being said, if you're still up for helping me be the coolest brother of the day, I live in Naperville, IL.   Thanks!
453	False	a	i have 3 kids and i live her ewith my husband we are struggling my husband just got laid off from work and i would just like something to be able to reward my kids to let them have something special.
454	False	a	My boyfriend and I live in Saint Augustine, Florida and have been having a rough time financially the past few months.  In and out of various jobs, we've had to survive off of coscto sized ramen packs, and pasta and olive oil.  I applied for food stamps a couple days ago, and am waiting to hear back from them.  It's getting a little trite, and we're quite hungry tonight, a hot pizza would be a delight.  We'll happily pay it forward in the future.  Much love.
455	True	a	Hey guys,  This is a throwaway account, I'm more than willing to go through the verification system if need be.    I could really use a helping hand right now.  I've been unemployed for 6 months now, haven't been able to find much work in Birmingham other than some manual labor.  I'm not complaining, I'll do anything I have to support myself.  I'm trying to cut out all expenses in my life, got rid of my phone, internet, sold my tv, so I'm in the library using their internet and their AC.  To add insult to injury, rubbing dirt on the wound, I had to put down my chocolate lab over the weekend.  Layla was getting old, she was a great lab, and I'm torn up inside right now.  I know it's childish, but I would love to sit down with a nice pizza, something I haven't had in as long as I can remember and just kinda zone out, at least for the night.
456	False	a	My name is Victoria I reside in Great Lakes IL I currently have $1.19 in my account for me and my daughter until Tuesday morning, a counselor on base pointed me to this site, anything would definetly help me and my daughter. I definitely plan on paying it back to someone on Tuesday.
457	False	a	DnD group is getting rather hungry from adventuring, would really appreciate some pizza!  Can prove with pictures if need be.
458	True	a	As the title says. I start my first teaching job tomorrow! But until my first paycheck I don't have spending room for awesome things like pizza. I will gladly pass the favor along come first paycheck!  
459	False	a	I didn't know there was a place on the internet where you could even make a request like this. Reddit is truly amazing and the people here are so nice. I find myself getting lost in threads, especially about memes, iama, and askreddit. I have to admit, I browse more than I make actual responses because I usually don't have the time to sit down and type out a response.             So today I find myself with nothing important to do. I slept in, cleaned up the place, went for a walk and came back with nothing to do. Even the programs on tv aren't that entertaining. I have a choice between Keeping up with the Kardashians and Pregnant and Dating. No thank you. I think I'll keep the tv off for now.           I would greatly appreciate something random and delicious, since my Saturday has been pretty ho hum so far.  Nothing fancy, but I would totally dig a cheese pizza. I would be so grateful if someone would be willing to treat me to some pizza tonight. Thank you. 
460	False	a	I quit my job to go abroad for 30 days.  Not the best decision of my life, but I would never get the opportunity to take a trip like I did again.  While I was gone, due to circumstances outside my control, I lost my apartment.  So, I come back after 30 days to no job and no place to live.  My roommate was kind enough to start packing for me after he had packed his own things.  Now I'm here, living with my parents who can't afford to take me in.  I've just got a job (I made seven dollars yesterday! Yay!) but, can't really afford to spend anything on anything extra.  I'd really just like a pizza.  I live in Alaska.  If anyone is willing to hook me up let me know.
461	False	a	and ate all of mine and my girlfriends plates. Please send a pizza to help!  http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090215074230/friends/images/8/8d/9x08-ChandlerBreaksPlates.jpg
462	False	a	recently lost my job blah blah same old give me pizza attitude. but really, it'd be nice and help a lot!!!
463	False	a	This is a throwaway/new account, but please don't let that scare you away. I am just your average 30 something unemployed, unpublished, unshaven (the 3 U's) author wannabe with a dream of getting published. I don't believe that things in life are free and I won't start believing that now. I'm offering to write a small but entertaining fantasy story for you. And yes, it has to be SFW and such as I will post the contents of this story for all to read.  If you'd like to read about a murder/mystery with break dancers or prefer your gnomes to carry gnome-made machine weaponry while riding raptors, I'm your man. You can toss some ideas my way if you're looking for something extra strange.   Please note, I am hungry but I feel much more comfortable working for my food. Thank you for reading my post and remember a day above ground is always better than the alternative. Make each day count! 
464	False	a	I'm majorly fatigued right now with a headache and a sore throat, and I don't feel like cooking at all (and all I have is ramen to cook anyway.) It'd make my day if somebody could hook me up with a pizza. Thanks in advance :)
465	False	a	My money should have come in at the beginning of May but it hasn't and cheap as they are, I really can't afford takeaways. I live in England and there are quite a few near me still open (according to Just Eat). If anyone knocking about would be able to help it would be much appreciated, this was done on a whim so no worries if no one can.
466	True	a	I appreciate all of you.
467	False	a	Been going through the same old routine for months. It would be interested if a random stranger on the internet gave me a pizza. I can promise to pizza it forward this Friday.
468	False	a	This is a throwaway account because I know people from real life on reddit. I have been having a LOT of financial trouble and I barely have enough to feed the kids, the wife and me. I have no problem letting the kids and wife eat over me but the thing is we barely have enough money to feed the kids an pay the bills. After I get done paying the bills I only have about 20 bucks to feed my family. I go to the dollar store and buy them some food but they are getting tired of eating the food from there. I would be so happy if someone were to give us a pizza and would gladly repay you when I get back on my feet. I'm at work right now but I'm doing this now because I don't want the kids to tell me how they want to eat something else. I live in Austin,Texas and if you read this thank you for taking the time to read my plea.
469	False	a	Roommates and I had to pay rent on Friday, and I am now broke until I get paid on Wednesday. Totally willing to pay it forward on Wednesday.   Looking for something to add a change to my rice and ramen I've got.
470	False	a	After paying rent this month, we are both short on money and grocery funds have been cut dramatically. If we eat anymore ramen we might go insane. We would be greatly appreciative if anyone could help us out! Thanks!
471	False	a	Let me start off by saying, I'm taking online classes to become a fully registered nurse, some of my expenses lately have been piling up at home   (I live with my mother, also a caregiver although she is full-time whereas I'm part-time because of school)   Honestly, I've been financially strapped this last month, and had to cut some expenses on foodstuffs at home, as well as the lunch I pack to work.   Finished my ham sandwich this morning I packed, and still dealing with the bipolar flare-ups of my patient, if anyone could provide some much needed brain-fuel so I can make it through this day a little easier, I'd really appreciate it :)  I promise to try to gift someone back next month when me and my mother get our paychecks from our patients' family.  
472	False	a	Rent is due tomorrow morning so I'm short on cash. All I have is some frozen chicken and rice but I'm about to begin working on a paper, a prelab, and study for a midterm. I just got back from football practice(I work for the team, UMD TERPS!)  I would love to have a pizza to get me through all this work I have to do.  THanks!
473	False	a	"I don't want a pity pizza, so I'll just list one awesome thing that's happened to me today and try and have an awesome moment pizza.  Loads of bad shit happening, deportation, ect. Really sad. Find a wallet on the street. Look inside. 800$+ dollars. Decide to steal it. Few minutes later, reconsider and take it to the bus station. Lady there looks inside and see's the $800, looks at me surprised, and gives me a smile. She asks for my name, and I say ""Your friendly neighborhood Normalman."" She laughs and wishes me a good day.  In Quebec, Canada, so I don't know how international pizza orders work, if it can't happen, no worries. Good day c:"
474	True	a	So, long story short, I have had a lot of medical issues in the past year, including 3 back surgeries since november.  Due to this, I lost my job 2 weeks ago.  I have no food or money to pay bills and was really hoping someone could help me out today with a pizza.  Thanks in advance.  -Keith From the US
475	True	a	Thought I'd ask for a pizza to make me feel better. I've been closing up at work for going on two weeks now, getting paid minimum wage and putting almost every cent toward rent next month. Coming home to a bowl of ramen and sleeping until time to do it all again is starting to wear on me. Anyone out there the kind of person who wants to give a random internet stranger[me] a pizza for troubles that, I'm sure, sound less troubling on a screen?
476	False	a	Hope I get a response!
477	False	a	Really nothing more to say. Been inside all day studying and all of us are hungry.
478	False	a	"My boyfriend, Kyle, is a very sweet guy. He recently moved in with some relatives (so he could be closer to me!), but they are having financial troubles, and in consequence do not have any food in their fridge, or cabinets. They usually are gone, and he feels bad asking for money/food.  I am a poor college student, and barely am able to afford my living expenses. But right now he is looking for a job (very diligently), and hasn't found one yet. He tells me every night that its ""okay"" 'cause he's living closer to me now, or that ""I could stand to lose a few pounds"". But this just makes me sad. He lives in Bellingham, Washington. If you are able/willing enough, post here/message me. It would make his (and my) day...maybe our week? If I can do anything in return, let me know. "
479	True	a	Hi RAOP! I'm currently a grad student and I don't get paid until next week and really really hungry. If anyone could help out with the gift of pizza (trust me, I can make it last for at least a few days), I will buy someone a pizza the day I get my paycheck in (I think it's next Friday). Thank you :D
480	True	a	anyone out there feeling generous to help me out with a amazing pie? starving over here. thanks for looking =D
481	False	a	Hi! My friend and I are crashing at our friend's place while she is on her honeymoon. We don't get paid until Christmas Eve (can prove if nec.) and are hungry. We don't have a car to drive anywhere to pick up. Would really appreciate some pizza :) Thanks a lot in advance. 
482	True	a	I will go ahead and say that I got a pizza meal from here before as to not seem like I'm scamming anyone. I have been promised 2 well-paying jobs and one minimum wage + .40 to fill in the gaps of unemployment of a second job, if that makes sense, but I'm waiting until they call me in for that expendable job, a background check for one, and a test request for the other. I will be able to pay forward this one and the previous random act of pizza when I can get my life straight. I will pay the previous one forward whether I get food from this or not. Didn't want to sound like I'm taking that promise to pay it forward hostage. Anyway, it would benefit me, my roommate, his brother, and his mom greatly if we could get some pizza.  Edit: Not caring what trolls like francewinwars say, especially if all they do is convince people to NOT help the less-fortunate. If anyone wants to roll the dice and buy us pizza for the day, I will pay it forward as soon as I get spare cash, which should be within the next couple of months.
483	False	a	I've noticed that the acceptable custom in RAOP appears to be to post your desire for pizza along with a compelling story of trial and hardship which validates your worthiness to receive said gift.  I don't have such grand aspirations.  My desires are pure, transparent, and fly in the face of this custom.  I want a pizza.  I want someone else to pay for it.  In some cosmic way, doe this warrant an x-post in r/firstworldanarchists?
484	False	a	So I'm in college now and am on a very limited budget...unfortunately, it's all been expended on books and food from earlier this semester (mostly books, they're about $100 a pop now).   I'm really living off of a stockpile pasta and this point...which gets VERY old fast. So, I would like to request a random act of pizza tonight! I can't tell you how happy it would make me!!   I'm in Washington, DC, by the way.  Also, I can submit you a picture of my bank account...which has a mere 87 cents in it now. I'm not sure how to post it on this page!!  
485	False	a	I got no one to blame for my situation but myself. I've been unemployed for a couple of weeks now after quitting my job at the mall over some really petty garbage. I was an idiot for doing it and now I've put myself in a place where I'm sinking fast. I've got no money, bills are okay but that wont last long, and I've got almost nothing in the way of food. My family doesn't speak to me anymore because I came out two years ago, so I can't fall back on them. I don't even know where my brother moved to last year, he didn't tell me before he left.   I go to to school full time at BCC and without income the gas money getting to the campus in downtown Ft Lauderdale three days a week is killing me. I have interviews lined up but there's no telling how long it will be before I get another check. I'm really ashamed of myself for thinking I could just quit and find a new job overnight. I haven't told any of my friends yet but I'm going to have to if nothing changes for me. The sooner the better I know, but I'm just terrified of telling them how badly I'm doing right now.   I'm asking for a handout in a big way because I've got nothing going for me right now. Even my grades aren't that great this semester. Can anyone on here help me this one time?
486	False	a	Just want to see if this place works!  Some pizza sounds great!
487	False	a	I'm new here so please have patience while I figure this out. I'm having a pregnancy craving for pizza but flat broke till payday. (Can show pics of the cobwebs in my wallet) I'm really cheap! Dominoes only costs me like $15ish to deliver and I have $5.97 in the bank so all I need is $10 in a dominos ecard or something! Would gladly love to repay the favor on payday! I think this is a great idea! Also I'm in the southern California area. 
488	True	a	Rather hungry and also broke. I sure hope I am in luck. I wish the very best for your requests, fellow hungry redditors! 
489	True	a	I live in Iowa. I have never posted on RAOP but the very idea behind it helps to instill my faith in humanity.
490	True	a	Just rescued two cats (http://imgur.com/fBpUELb) from our neighborhood and brought them in for vaccinations today. I ended up having to empty my bank account (~$200) for the FVRCP shots, parasite tests, exam fees and IV Fluids for one that was dehydrated. They're home now and finally warming up to me!   I'd love a pizza (and I'm sure they'll be fighting me for it).   Thanks!
491	False	a	Hey, RAoP. I'm a musician looking to have a little fun and get a little more experience with recording. I'm not personally requesting any food, but I'm rather offering my services for those of you out there that want a little more of an incentive to buy someone else a pizza (as if the real life karma isn't enough lol).  So here's the deal: I will write and record you a personalized (to your username) jingle/song (depends on if the creative juices are flowing) if you buy someone else a pizza!  This doesn't have to start and end right now. Let's make it a project! Buy someone requesting a pizza in this thread and I'll write you a song for it! If you want to know my capabilities, check out some of the stuff I've written and recorded at [www.jonmiklues.com](http://jonmiklues.com). If you want a song in a specific genre or style, let me know!  I'm looking forward to the challenge!
492	False	a	Yea, there's nothing too it. I'm honestly just hungry and pizza is my favorite food in the world.  will be sure to return the favor asap  Maple ridge, BC, Canada
493	True	a	hello! i just subscribed today, so maybe this is a shot in the dark, but... i'm a severely underemployed freelancer with way too much time between work/checks... super hungry at the moment, and would love some pizza. the only place around here is dominos, but that's fine cos they're pretty cheap. i submitted invoices this week for $650, so i would gladly repay double the pizza when i get my checks, which will hopefully be later this week but no later than the following. anyway, thanks for reading, what you guys do here is awesome :D
494	True	a	I'm currently 25 weeks pregnant, and between checks.  I've eaten dry Kix today, and nothing else.  I could really use some actual food.  Any help would be great.  We have a Papa Johns, Dominoes, and Pizza Hut in town.  Thank you so much!
495	True	a	Hi all.  It's my first time posting here, though I've been a redditor for a few years now.  I wanted to make sure that I didn't post here until I absolutely needed it.  I've been broke all summer.  I've been looking for a job, but so far I've found nothing.  In two weeks my financial aid will come in.  I have an amazing job lined up for fall and winter.  But right now I could really do with some real food.  It's been over a month since I've known where my next meal will come from.  Thank you, good people of Random Acts of Pizza, for truly understanding the value of community :)  Edit:  Wow!  Thank you!  Logicday not only bought me pizza for the night, but also a $100 giftcard at Target so I can support myself these next two weeks.  There are no words.  I am truly grateful.
496	False	a	"After getting what had to be hundreds of ""We're sorry"" letters (and that's only the places that bothered to reply) I've finally run the gamut of interviews and got an offer!  I've been stretching my pennies quite far throughout this process, but the job is in another part of the country and I need to make sure I have enough scratch to make the trip.    I'd love to be able to celebrate a bit and have some tasty pizza, and I look forward to being able to pay it forward before the end of the month. (I start the 22nd)  I have the big three close to me, and anything would make me so grateful!  Thanks for reading, and good luck to other job-seekers out there - it can seem like it's futile, but just keep at it!"
497	False	a	I was going to take them out and get something to eat but its raining and my tummy is grumbling for some pizza. 
498	False	a	Im going home for the holidays tommorow, but im completely out of food! I would have to walk 25 minutes to buy one meal. A pizza would make my night awesome! Thanks  I live in Quebec, sherbrooke!
499	False	a	Basically the title. I was in Baltimore looking at some potential apartments for my junior year in school. I think the pick-pocket got me while waiting in line at KFC because I didn't have it on me when I got up to the cashier to make the order :/ New card (and ID) is being sent but won't get here for a couple of days. I would really appreciate the help, you guys.  Thanks in advance to anyone :)
500	False	a	My summer job at a college orientation didn't pay me in time to pay most of my bills, and I'm actually still waiting to see that paycheck because when it finally got sent out it go sent to my grandparents' house two hours away. In the meantime, my roommates at my apartment are on a health kick and I haven't had red meat or anything greasy in weeks. Pizza would be a very, very welcome break from my circumstances right now!
501	False	a	So I am currently home alone, having a miniature break down about the fact that I have no real friends anymore and that I might or might not be a complete waste of space. Pizza in my opinion is the ultimate comfort food. My day, well my whole summer, has been pretty bad. I've pretty much been black listed from my home town and I feel more alone and worthless than I have in a really long time. A pizza would definitely cure me of my constant sobbing that's been happening all day. So if anyone is feeling like cheering up a sad nobody in Colorado, I would be sooooo happy.....
502	True	a	[Edit:  Fountain, Colorado]  My wife and I live on my social security, and anyone out there on it knows the dates for benefits always suck because it never pays on the same date, always making things bad.  Our families are several states away and they're broke too.  My grandmother sent us cookies a few days ago and that's what we've lived on other than some instant rice.  We even started googling whether we can eat the cat's food.  We usually only eat one meal a day and a pizza would get us so much closer.    I have been pizza'd before in a contest and we gave that away months ago to someone who needed it a lot more than us.   Thank you RAOP.
503	True	a	"Okay, so I'm going to try to keep this short, and stay with me because it really is a series of slightly unrelated events that landed me in my situation. Sometime on Sunday, my Xbox Live account was stolen, and almost $140 dollars worth of Xbox Live points were charged to my debit card. I called Xbox and got help getting a claim filed as soon as I realized. THEY said it would take 25 days, and I should contact my bank if I want a speedier return of my precious monies. They also said my Xbox live account would remain suspended until their investigation was complete.  Today after work, I did so, getting another fraud case opened by my bank. The banker said, or so I thought, that my card would be closed **in** 5-7 days. Mission accomplished, I head to the grocery story to buy something for dinner.     I had my food items rounded up and checked out, when BAM! My card was declined. Okay... maybe they went ahead and turned it off for purchases. No worries, my bank is across the street, and while they may be closed, they have an ATM.    Maybe you see where this is going...    OM NOM NOM went the ATM, gobbling my debit card and spitting out a mere slip of paper in its stead- in essence it said ""this is **our** card now, criminal.""    So that's it. No entertainment (by way of online video games), no food (by way of the cancelled card), and not even a way to get money (by way of the gluttonous automatic teller machine) until sometime tomorrow when I can physically walk into my bank and withdraw the cash from their electronic grasp. "
504	False	a	I am taking the GRE this week, so in the midst of midterms I am also studying for this test that will determine the next several years of my life, and ultimately, my career. I don't really have the time or money to deal with food at the  moment. I'm also a small girl, and a pizza will last me several days. Thanks for reading.  Edit: Forgot location... Idaho!
505	True	a	So Let me just start off with an introduction. I live in a house With 13 people. We all Pay for everything together. Including food, It's basically part of our rent. We also have 4 other houses that are run this way and we all work together. Well we went to place our monthly bulk food order this week. we go through this guy who used to lie here because he does it for a few places and get a discount this way. well anyway this week we get a notification that our bulk order didn't go through because the company didn't get our money. So we call this guy and he SWEARS he paid them and its a company error. So of course we called back the company and they did a thourough search and found nothing. Now the man is not answering us or anyone. So We have no food money for this month and no food. It's my turn to cook dinner tonight and i dont know what to do. Can anyone help us out? Thanks in advance
506	True	a	Hi my fellow redditors. Stuck in a college dorm at my uni in Grand Junction Colorado. It's been a rough year for my parents and I wasnt able to travel home for the holidays. Would be awesome to enjoy a yummy pizza with my roomie who is in the same boat. Happy holidays to each and all.
507	False	a	I am a student in Atlanta. I am out of meals for my meal plan (i paid for it) and was just wondering if anyone could help me out today. I'm figuring out  my money situation now, but until I get funds, I can't eat. I would really appreciate anything at all.
508	True	a	If someone comes through, I will give you an awesome shout out in a YouTube video tonight! (3,000+ Subscribers)
509	False	a	So, here is my story. I am a 19 year old college student that has been trying to get various jobs for 5 years now. My town is at a low point for a while and even getting hired at McDonalds is a competition between young kids and elders. This, however, is beside the point.  I want to surprise my dad with his favorite Large Cheese Pizza from Pizza Hut. I want to do this because he recently quit smoking. This is pretty big as my family as a huge history of addiction. He quit drinking 2 years ago after 3 years of nearly killing himself. He has liver cirrhosis and if he cannot get a transplant within 6 years, he is guaranteed to die. So, I want to reward him for cleaning himself up and being strong for the rest of our family. If someone can help, that would be great. I have seen some awesome things done here, and you are all fantastic.  Thank you
510	True	a	anyone could please feed a starving girl from south florida. last time i asked i went to sleep to forget my hunger, so i dont know if anyone responded. Ill try and stay up this time.  thanks in advance
511	False	a	I'm an educator who is also a student.  I'm usually the one to help others out when they are in need.  But now I find myself who is the one in need.  After paying the mortgage, and the Phone bill and the light bill I found myself not able to pay for or buy any food for myself.  That was all most two weeks ago.  A friend of mine told me about this website so hear I am.  I hope that some one see's this post and is kind enough to help some one like me out with a pizza.   I'm in Conyers, GA       
512	False	a	Two families living together 10 people 4 adults 6 kids ages 11, 11 , 9, 7, 6 , 4 would love some pizza tonight we're broke and being evicted soon (can show proof) we get foodstamps but we're out of food and won't get foodstamps till the 10th . any help would be greatly appreciated , thank you ! i won't be able to check my messages again until about 3pm so i might not respond withing minutes , thanks
513	False	a	No particular sob story here, just had nothing to eat since yesterday afternoon, and I dont get paid till tomorrow night, dominoes &amp; papa johns are the ones in my area.  Thanks folks.
514	False	a	I'm embarrassed to ask because I'm always a giver, but I would love to receive a large meat lovers deep dish pizza from Cottage Inn with mushrooms and onions on the whole thing and jalapeno on half.   My boyfriend and I have been craving pizza the entire week, and he's coming over tonight but I can't afford to buy one. I don't have any meal plans left for the semester (ends Monday the 19th), and I can basically only feed him a sandwich or Cheerios. It would be awesome if someone could help out. I just spent all of my money on my monthly bills and books for next semester. Please and thank you!  EDIT: I can verify that I'm human or whatever. I will also try to do a random act of kindness for someone this weekend.
515	False	a	We have a problem. We desire Zza, yet we lack the required funds. Please help us impoverished college bums with our urgent dilemma. 
516	True	a	I just graduated and realized I have no job and and $35000 in student loans. I haven't even been able to celebrate my graduation much at all because I don't have money.  A free pizza would really make me feel better about my situation in general, at least for a little while.  I know there are a lot of people in more need than me and I want to leave this subreddit better off than I found it. So, I definitely plan on buying pizza for random redditors in need once I have a job.  Forgot to mention: It's my last 48 hours in NYC before I move upstate.  **Edit:**   The good news: A very kind person who wished to remain anonymous sent me a $20 e-gift card to Pizza Hut!  The bad news: Even though I live in New York freakin' City, there is no pizza hut close enough that delivers to me! And I don't have a car. So, as of right now, I am unable to use it.  The second good news: I am moving soon. So, I will either use this in the near future or I will just pass it on to some other individual in need!  So, thank you RAOP! I am pretty happy right now, even though I am not eating pizza at the moment!
517	True	a	So, I haven't been able to keep anything but crackers down for a while now, and nothing has sounded good to me.  But I woke up today, and all I could think about was how damned good a pizza sounded. Except I'm broke until Thursday.  So, if someone is feeling generous, I'd absolutely love a simple pepperoni pizza.  I have a verification code, if that sways anyone's decision?
518	False	a	Some stuff came up and we've been eating ramen noodles so long we've run of of things to put in it to taste better.  It'd be a great day to get a pizza.
519	False	a	I got fired over a stupid coworker messing up. He stole my swipe card, signed into the cash till and $300 went missing. Because my name was on the register, i got canned. It's been a really bad day and I just need a pick me up in the form of pizza.      I live in Canada if that helps. I fully plan to pay it forward when I can, I just can't spend anything right now.
520	True	a	Got booted out of the military several months ago due to downsizing and been waiting on this new job since then. I got it, just waiting for the spot to open and hopefully it's within the week. All our savings are gone and barely subsisting in this 1k rent apartment, cost of living is ridiculous and I can't move cause i'm getting the job anyday. Borrowing from family to make the bills and ramen and other asian staples are managing to get me and my wife by. Just a little something to cheer her and the baby up would be nice. Not used to asking for stuff just I'm pretty sure she's tired of rice and soup. verification code, also new to this so I don't know the procedure pm me.
521	False	a	Hi I a m new to this site hope that I do this right.  Im wishing for a pizza today for my family.  We have not have anything as I am awaiting approval for snap and currently no food pantrys today.  Hope someone out there would grant our wish. We have a Dominos.. pizza hut in our town.  Thankyou so much and godbless
522	True	a	Like the title says, I plan on eating some ramen and frozen veggies, but a nice pizza would be great. Papa johns is close by, but I don't think either of the other big companies can deliver. 
523	False	a	We're broke college students. If we don't get pizza soon I fear we're gonna start eating each other. But we have a guitar and shitty singing abilities!  Edit: We're in Greeley, CO
524	True	a	I've got $0.90 to my name. And her next few paychecks are going to medical bills. I don't get paid till Monday. We'd be more than appreciative if we had some real food. Thanks.
525	False	a	No food til Saturday and could use a yummy pizza. Anyone willing to help??
526	False	a	hey raoh i was hoping someone could hook me up with a celebritory pizza for finding out today i got a job after 9 grueling months of being outta work. naturally i wont have any money til i get paid so a pizza  would be double as great! oh and u better believe it will be paid forward with first check!
527	False	a	I'm a father of 2 kids, a 5 year old boy and a 7 year old girl.  Its summer break so im home with them during the day.  No cash until Friday and, though they wont complain if I give them another PBJ, I know they'd really dig some pizza! 
528	True	a	I get paid in a week, so I've got rice and beans, ramen, and pasta to last me until then. If you've ever seen the movie Pay It Forward, I'll be sure to do that when I have any money at all. Any kind of pizza sounds amazing! D: 
529	True	a	Hello, I was informed about this site through someone. Both my roommate and I share funds and our bank account is at 4 dollars till Friday. We thought we would just be able to go without food till then but our rumbling tummies tell us other wise. If anyone would be kind enough to send a pizza our way we would greatly send someone a pizza once we get paid even tough our pay will be cut short being my roommate had taken a week off due to being sick . Thank you to anyone who is willing to help.
530	False	a	Long story short, I came to a retreat, and could not stay due to health problems. I am now stuck pretty far from home with no ride until tomorrow, and I spent what little money I had on a hotel. Im really in need of something to eat, and will gladly pay it forward when I get home and have the chance.
531	False	a	Hello RAOP! As the title says we're two guys, just finished highschool, starting college in two weeks. We're from mid Europe, spending the end of our holidays in Canada, Montreal, staying in a 2-starred hotel.  Respecting the rules - no making up stories - I can't say we are completely cashless. But I sure can say we're running short with it, and we still need some for subway, and buses.  We'd appreciate just anything! Thank you very much guys.
532	True	a	Not really a sob story, just paid bills so I can't afford pizza for my wife and I. Really craving one. Thanks if anyone finds it in their heart to help out. :-)
533	False	a	As the title says, broke, alone and would love a pizza. I'll answer all questions :)
534	False	a	I just got into bellingham this morning, trying to find a job on a fishing boat, and ended up spending several days worth of money on the taxi/hotel so i could have a recuperating night. anyone willing to float a pizza my way? i'll most definitely pay it forward when i get setup. plus i'll love you. 
535	False	a	Long story short my husband and I both worked at the same company driving medical supplies to and from hospitals. We were required to use our own vehicles because the company only had so many (that were breaking down anyway).  The transmission went in my husbands car and our boss told him that he refuses to pay for the gas to run the stuff in a van instead of his car that he can't afford to get fixed and fired him.  We were in a tight spot in the first place because we're constantly spending our money on fixing the cars (that we still owe $10k on) + necessities. We have an infant, 9yr old, 11yr old and a pet dog. Ever since he lost his job we've been eating nothing but cheap things (hamburger helper, ramen, hot dogs) for at least a month.  We were accepted for food stamps but with my income they only give us $150 per month which lasts us a week with the amount of food my boys consume. My husband has had interview after interview with no luck whatsoever. I think they'd be really happy to come home from the pool tonight and have a great feast of pizza.   Tldr; We're broke and sick of the same dinner table scenery and would really like a couple pizzas tonight.  We were taken care of! Thanks so much to MamaGrr!
536	False	a	Bank account at -36. Still looking for a job. Haven't eaten since Saturday morning and no gas to get to foodbank. We get a little bit of money on Wednesday for gas and milk for one-year old son.  Pizza or job in Dallas area would be very appreciated.
537	False	a	Hey all, I'm paying for my own college and trying to keep costs as low as possible. Therefore, there is no room in my budget for pizza, but I am seriously Jonesing a pepperoni pizza right now. If you can help me out, PM me and we'll get something sorted out. Thanks for looking!
538	True	a	So, I didn't find out my wife was leaving me today, I found that out a couple weeks ago, but, I did find out it was for another guy today. Worst day of my life, and I need something to eat, but I don't feel motivated to do anything, not even cook. I would be appreciative of whomever would like to help me out, and I'll pass it on when I get paid on Thursday.
539	False	a	I've been friends with Sam for about 5 years now. We run together, we game together, I wingman for him every week, but it's his 22nd birthday tomorrow and I have absolutely nothing to give him. I'm out of dinero, got rice and oatmeal in the cupboard. Mother Hubbard up in here. I'd love some help!
540	False	a	"My friends and I are working on our High School Senior gift, an enormous mural. (Even though we have already graduated). I recruited a bunch of non- artistic friends, because my original ""art"" partner totally bailed on me with the entire thing. We would love a pizza! PM if you are feeling generous! (No Pressure!) We are willing to carry out!"
541	False	a	haha true. culinary student with a pretty sad looking fridge at the moment, could use some pizza in a temporary time of need!
542	False	a	Pregnant and craving pizza!! Will pay it forward on payday! :)
543	False	a	Unfortunately I don't get paid until Friday, but I have under a dollar in my bank account, no cash, and an empty fridge. I'm off to work until 7PM ET, but I just thought I'd throw this out there. Thanks for your time RAOP &lt;3 
544	False	a	      I'm new to Reddit and a friend a few weeks back told me about this when we were watching YouTube clips about 60 inch pizzas but I could barely believe it existed until I saw it today.        Sooo basically a few weeks back I had a job interview for some Christmas hours to get money for peoples presents... I was supposed to start on the 3rd but was told I couldn't until I sorted out my work reference. That was all fine and dandy until I call them up 3 days later to see what is going on to only get told they have filled all spots even though they said my job was guaranteed. Oh I also got hit with woman problems this week... PIZZA won't fix things but it'll sure help!    
545	False	a	if you can i will really appreciate it. i have looked and saw that only Pizza Hut has a way to buy pizza with online payment. if you can buy me a Vegetarian Pizza i will be happy.   Thanks.
546	False	a	Working hard is not paying off. Got ripped off on a car deal by my own brother. Family is Jehovah's witnesses so no thanksgiving foodz for me. Never had a birthday celebration. I'm 23 yo security guard that refuses to snitch people out for infractions. I smoke weed when I can afford it but I don't drink. I've sent dvds and and other oddball gifts to internet strangers in the past. Honestly, I don't know if this will work, but ill give it a shot because I'm really tired of ramen and peanut butter an jelly sammichs. Topeka, Kansas. Redditor for three years. This account is newer. Like the handle better. Maybe a little much to write. Fuck it. I say what I feel.
547	True	a	I've been down on my luck lately. I have a job but I just can't get hours :&lt; (I'm trying to get a different job right now) not to mention that they didn't even pay me for my work last week (I've talked to them about it and I'm waiting for my paycheck but who knows when that will show up).  I did get a check to help pay for food from a non profit group my mom deals with but I was stupid and didn't cash it but deposited it. So I may be able to use it Tuesday or so but I'm running out of food. Overall I would love a pizza to nibble on for the next couple of days. I also do plan on helping people out here once my financial situation is all settled :3
548	False	a	Okay , title was a bit dramatic.  But he is really sick.  He's been sniffling ,  dizzy , nauseous  and pathetic for the last couple days (his only days off this week)  His family is in a tough financial situation  (Living on savings for the next 12 months until his mom's out of school and into a new job) so he's been eating jello  , and the chicken noodle soup I dropped off for him.  Can we please get him something solid , delicious and pizza shaped to eat so he can get better and return to work tomorrow!? :(
549	True	a	i received once before from raop and i thank you, but i seem to have found myself at your mercy once again. up till Wednesday i had bout $30 to get me till payday. found out the hard way that businesses have up to a year to actually collect funds from a card purchase. it almost over-drafted my account but thankfully took some from my savings luckily saving me from a fee but also draining that as well. i am by no means probably the neediest person here, but today was another horrid day at my dead end job and some pizza love or hell even some kind words would help my mood. Again thank you all you everything you do here.  verification code available if anyone wants it.
550	True	a	A few weeks ago my head gasket unexpectedly warped and repairs wrecked my savings for the summer. I had been prepared to remain unemployed until I return to school in the Fall, but at the moment I'm operating on a shoestring budget and scrambling for jobs. I've been able to pay my rent, utilities, and internet, and buy cheap staples like eggs and PB&amp;J stuff. Ever since I repaired my car, my boyfriend and I have been applying for jobs diligently, 5 or 6 a day, but yesterday my check engine light came on after some trouble accelerating from a stop sign. I haven't driven it again and I'm at my wits' end. I wouldn't have repaired the head gasket initially, except we don't live near enough to grocery stores where our food stamps stretch the whole month to live without a car. In the meantime...we'd just love a slice. Additionally, when I get my first paycheck in the Fall - sometime in October - I will PM you, and buy you pizza. I am a man of my word. I also plan to frequent this subreddit after every payday from now on because I honestly never thought I'd be here. Thanks, Reddit. :)  Edit: I'm in Southern Oregon. Is there something else I should include?
551	False	a	"hi my names Alex (""Angel"" to friends) i'm 23, just moved out of my house today because my roommates didn't want to pay their half of bills and in the process of going through my first eviction even though i was the responsible one. payed for myself to have a hotel for the week so i wasn't in the street (no family here and not wanting to go to a shelter) and realized there was no left over money for food. i was talking with an old friend of mine and he said something about the site. i couldn't believe it lol kinda crazy when u think about it but i wanted to try it out and see if it was a real thing. So if there is a ""Giver"" who wouldn't mind, i would be more than appreciative,                                                                     All my Sincerity,                                                                               ANGEL &lt;3   "
552	False	a	This May I got pneumonia and ended up in the hospital for 4 days because my immune system wouldn't kick in and fight the infection in my lungs.  Fast forward a few months and I am in the college of my dreams, but my immune system has taken a pot shot at me again.  First it was an ear infection in week 2 of Fall Quarter, now it is the flu.  I've missed so much class I may have to go on medical leave.   My story is long and messy - my life really exploded this spring/summer, which is why I am a 30 year old living in the college dorms. *facepalm* I'd be glad to share more of the story if you'd like, but in the meantime it would be great to have some food other than the Easy Mac, stale tortilla chips and soda I've been living on since getting sick.  Maybe something a little better would help me get well?  I can only hope!  Thanks in advance, Reddit :) 
553	False	a	Hey guys, my roommate/partner in rhymes lost his job yesterday and I've been unable to find work for months.  We've no money (at all) for at least another few days and we're down to three potatoes.  These boys are heavily craving some za to break the monotony and lift our spirits a bit. Thanks in advance to anyone wishing to send some good karma our way!
554	False	a	I was away on business for the first two weeks of August.  I've been back for the last two weeks, but I've been extremely busy with work so I haven't been grocery shopping.  After leaving the office on about the 9th 14 hour or so day, I realized I had left my wallet in our Core location.  While this normally wouldn't be a big deal, that is the only location I don't have access to outside of business hours.  I found this out as I was at the grocery store getting ready to buy some food (I figured it was time).  Now I'm hungry and tired. Oh, and I have to head to the office for a maintenance window in another 7 or so hours.  Any generous souls out there?  Edit:  I should sleep instead.  I realize I can get back to my wallet tomorrow and a few hours hungry isn't going to kill me.
555	False	a	Canadian post-grad here, I don't really want to get into too much detail about myself suffice to say that I have bills racked up that I need to pay and no job to pay for them, increasingly falling into debt and I know it's crazy but I've been prioritizing paying down my student loans than feeding myself. I'm not sure how much longer I can go on like this, I've lost a lot of weight over the past few months and things just keep getting worse. If my father was still alive I'm sure I wouldn't need to ask for this help, but in the current financial state my mother is in I cannot ask her for help (she would help me, but then she would have nothing to eat, maybe even lose her house).  I feel disgusted with myself that it has come to this, my self esteem isn't usually this low but with everything the way it is, it's hard to feel good about myself.
556	False	a	My mama is in town,and we have no food...Someone stole my foodstamp card and we are waiting for a new one,if anyone would get us a pizza tonight,my mother and i would be so thankful...she just got off of a greyhound from GA that was a 22 hour ride and could use a nice dinner. Godbless
557	False	a	His business is not doing so hot (printing - just like from the show The Office hah.) and he hasn't been too happy about it. I know I could go out and get him a pizza but A) I don't have any money B) He would go completely crazy if he knew it was from reddit.   Thanks guys! This subreddit is amazing. I love you guys
558	True	a	would be a great surprise for my son to have pizza tonight! 
559	False	a	Hungry and would love some food but we're all broke and still working on homework. Any love for some Seattle students?
560	False	a	I would appreciate some carbs in the form of pizza to stifle my cravings and cramps!
561	True	a	My birthdays coming up here and well, I've got absolutely nothing going on. Everyone parties on my day while I stay at home and watch the ball drop. I know how odd it is to ask for a present but hey let's try it, a present of pizza!  Here's some [proof](http://imgur.com/VnXUH) that New Years is indeed my birthday. Really haven't a way to show my sad party... Just picture a person, in front of a computer and my cat wearing a birthday hat!  Edit: got pizza'd and had a fun time... even Que had  a bite :) Thanks morzinbo! 
562	False	a	Just passed the last check ride in order to get my License next week, Big day! anyway it's all paid for through the military, so I don't have a job/money to by my own Pizza. if your in Bend or want to come to Bend I will give you a ride in a helicopter, for free.
563	True	a	Hey, thanks for reading this post. I'm a college student living in Hamilton ohio, I've just finished pulling my third all nighter for a final project in the last four days. I'm really hungry and would LOVE a pizza tonight since it seems I'll be up again. I would love an e-card to larosas, papa johns, or marcos, since those are the only places within a reasonable driving distance for me.  Again, thank you for reading this post, and REALLY thank you if someone decides to make my fourth all nighter a lot less depressing. 
564	False	a	im strugglin out here livin with my mom whos never home cause she works all the time. anything would be appreciated,  please and thank you, god bless.
565	True	a	OP will deliver.
566	False	a	So my story... I'm a university student, busy doing homework, lectures and reddit.  I had to cut my work hours down to the times I was available due to school and I've been getting an average of 4 hours a week... ($10.25/hr).  I've been having problems with having enough money to even bring a lunch at school and I've been pretty much free-loading off of my buddy.  I'm just looking for some nice person to help me out so I can treat him back for all the times he's bought me food.  Thank you for taking the time to read my story.  EDIT: I forgot to mention location: Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada.  Thanks again to anyone who might consider. :)  
567	False	a	I've just gotten back from holiday today (Greece) which was a clusterfuck of disasters - I was robbed, my iPhone stolen and my money, and have several stitches above my eye to boot. While I was away my girlfriend had her apartment broken into by a lone male and she woke up with him assaulting her luckily she screamed and he was frightened away by her housemate running in, but it could have been a LOT worse.   she has some facial bruising and bruises to her hands, and from talking to her on the phone tonight she is pretty terrified. As a backstory, my girlfriend is from my town but is working 3500 miles away in columbus, ohio, until the end of next year, meaning I cant be there to make her feel better  &amp; thanks to my mishaps while abroad, I have no money to do anything about it and no way to talk to her other than landline calling (we've tried skype but it drops constantly - facetime is a dream come true for us but it will be around 20 days til my insurance coughs up for a replacement phone, so its going to be a nightmare until then!)  so basically I'd like some help in cheering up the poor girl. for obvious reasons giving her address out on the internet right now would be a big no-no, but i'm not sure if there is any other way to do it? if there isnt, then can someone from there give me some pointers on an online site i can order for her? i don't mind racking up some over limit fees if it comes to it &amp; last thing I want to do is come across as a scammer. (you can see I did post an askreddit about the incident yesterday, alas it didn't get a single reply! img-foreveralone).  if anyone can help, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks
568	False	a	The Detroit Red Wings lost their series with Nashville tonight, and Pittsburgh beat Philly again. This is not a good night. A pizza from a kind Redditor would really help ease the pain. And I WILL pay it forward this summer when I have more money again.
569	False	a	I'm 24, live in Missouri, and could really use some food with sustenance. I'm between jobs and living with a friend who is paying for the rent and bills until I can find work. Any kindness would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!
570	True	a	Exactly what it says. I've been sick for the last couple of days and would love a pizza seeing how there's no food in the house either.
571	True	a	I'm really high right now and love some pizza.  Morning after edit because I couldn't edit on my phone: Thanks /u/unaspirateur for the delicious noms.
572	True	a	I've been awake for around 56 hours for a little experiment that I'm doing and a pizza would be so great. I'm not entirely in need and I'm not gonna starve to death or anything but I don't have any cash lying around to buy myself a pizza. I'm in Eastern Canada. If you guys don't feel like buying for me, at least go help someone else :) I'll pay it forward when I get the cash.
573	False	a	I live on maui and pizza is my favorite food. Can play some acoustic guitar covers or would write an original track, got a couple GOPROs at my disposal could do some action vids or like some Fabio beach photoshoot album. first time poster, open to suggestions :) ~aloha
574	False	a	Hi, I'm a college student in Toronto. I've been saving for a while to go to school and my 2nd half of tuition is due in a month. I moved from my hometown so I had to give up my job and I am having alot of trouble finding a new job in my new home. And I would really appreciate a pizza :)
575	False	a	It's just been a shitty month. Been broke since I had to drive down to my sister's funeral. Was fired because it took me week of being stuck in MS with car toubles before I got back. Had to give my cat away because i can't afford to keep him. His name was Clegg and he was pretty much my best friend. And my real life best friend is moving away tomorrow. I hate giving a sob story, but i'm just really really down and hungry. please help. Thank you reddit.
576	True	a	I live near Wichita and the wife and I (and three kids) are on a super tight budget right now.  She would be ecstatic to be surprised with a pizza!
577	False	a	I'm not by a long shot the most deserving candidate on RAoP, but it has been awhile since I've had anything but cafeteria slop.      A hot greasy pizza sounds awesome.       In New Zealand, closest place is [Domino's](http://www.dominospizza.co.nz/). 
578	False	a	So me and my friend are stuck in our dorm while our friends are at a party that both of our ex gf's are also at. We're hoping our friend's didn't invite us cause of that reason. Either way, we're feelin a bit down, as well as sober, broke, and hungry. If any friendly Redditor would like to help us out a bit, we'll definitely return the favor to another hungry Redditor down the road. Thanks Reddit :)
579	False	a	My roommate and I are college seniors, finals week. We're both pretty much out of food aside from a few cans of soup and oatmeal. Some pizza tonight would be AMAZING. I will also pledge to return the favor in three weeks when I'm back home and working. Swearsies. [This is us](http://i.imgur.com/yYfXD.png) (sorry for the duckface)
580	False	a	I have nothing in my bank account and im hoping one of these really great givers can help me out. I just want something to eat for lunch, actually I could stretch a pizza for the whle week till I get paid thursday night. I will do any kind of verification you need, I'm just really hungry. THanks
581	False	a	I'm a broke college kid and today is my birthday. Most of my friends are out of town as next week is homecoming and all of my family is 6 hours away. Just looking for some random Pizza to make things better. Proof: http://imgur.com/0Swi9 Location: Vermillion, South Dakota
582	False	a	I've probably eaten one meal in the past 3 days. I am broke and don't get paid until Tuesday, and my house is devoid of any food. A pizza would be much appreciated right now. I will take a picture for verification is you'd like.
583	False	a	Hey guys. I hate asking for things, but if someone feels like helping a fellow Minnesotan, or a fellow musician, or just wants to be kind to a new member me and my stomach would be infinitely grateful. It hurts to be so hungry.... ONE pizza would probably get me through a week. Been applying for jobs for over a month, still no calls... I've been wanting to go out and apply for some more today, but I'm just so tired and it's hard to even get off the couch without enough energy. Just learned about this site and I think it's a beautiful thing that's happening here. I will surely donate a pizza someday when I have the means. I live in Maplewood, MN... my address can be given if someone would like to get me something. :) Have a good day everyone.
584	True	a	My close uncle is in the hospital. I don't know the full details but he more or less lost his mind. For the past 3 weeks he has been making up strange stories that got more and more strange and the other day it got very bad and he passed out and has been in the hospital since. Tomorrow me and my fiancee are driving 220 miles to go visit him and the rest of my family and I am using the last of my money to do so. I am out of a job and so is she and we would both love to be able to just relax tonight with a nice pizza to help cheer us up. I promise to pay it forward as soon as I get a job or some extra money.  EDIT: Forgot to include our location. We live in Plymouth, Indiana.
585	True	a	I'm a college student pulling an all nighter to study for finals. I'm pretty much broke at this moment I have $6.29 in my account and a dollar in my pocket. I would appreciate it if someone would send me a pizza. Please and thank you!
586	False	a	Hi RAOP. I'm starving, I could seriously need some pizza :/ I live in Denmark though.
587	False	a	I have no sob story here, just jobless right now no food in fridge and hungry,I'd love to pay it forward once I get back on my feet again. would love it if someone could help me out today, sick of bumming off of my friends even though they say they dont mind
588	True	a	My husband and I recently got married and moved into a new place, spent money on rent, furniture, groceries. I just recently found a job but I don't start until next weekend. My husband is in the military but don't let that fool you, they give us just enough to pay our bills and we've been eating rice for days. I would appreciate any redditor willing to help us out so we can enjoy our saturday night together once he comes home from work. I will definitely pay it forward as soon as I start work next weekend! 
589	False	a	I just want a little something to brighten the week up, and I'm getting pretty damn sick of ramen every day.  Pretty terrible week altogether, culminating in running out of gas on the highway last night with no money. Met with a few very nice strangers at a gas station a few hours later who knew a police officer that paid for a few gallons that got me home.
590	False	a	My parents come tomorrow, and I have $2 to eat.  A pizza would be very much appreciated, and I can pay it forward later.  Thank you all, and have a great day!  EDIT:  Should've read the sidebar better.  Forgive me.  I'm in Texas
591	True	a	title really says it all. Lots of tests, projects, and other assorted details to crank out over the next 2 and a half weeks.
592	False	a	Like the title says, had to pay an unexpected bill that I was going to pay this coming Friday on payday. We thought we had until friday but it turns out that we didn't. Wasn't able to buy food for us this week in trade of having gas to get to work. Anyone out there in a charitable mood today? :)
593	False	a	Working in Atlanta, absolutely willing to pizza it forward. Just want some grub. Thanks guys
594	False	a	Basically what the title says, I had a back spasm this morning and after seeing my trainer and having a little stim therapy I have barely left bed all day. Go ahead and give to that guy who lost his job first I'm sure he needs it more than I do but if you have pizza to spare I would truly appreciate it.
595	False	a	A person i went to school with posted this to facebook...I would normally help but I am pretty broke right now myself...but I still have food...if anyone wants to order them a pie I would gladly pay it forward when I'm not as broke   http://imgur.com/KZVYsc5.jpg 
596	False	a	Hey! I'm a recent college grad in Seattle and I've been having a tough time trying to live on my own what with trying to find a job, pay rent and pay off loans simultaneously. I've really been craving pizza this week and it would be amazing to not have to eat ramen, rice or beans for a change. I can provide any verification needed and I hope to be on my feet soon to pay it forward.
597	False	a	"My boyfriend ended our relationship of 7 years to go back to his ex. About 6 months ago he got back in contact with his ex and I really didn't think much of it. Alot of people connect on Facebook, Reddit, etc. so I didn't assume they were doing anything other than just chatting. Turns out his ""late meetings for work"" were actually times where he would go out with his ex. I only found this out a week ago when I called one of his co-workers who told me they never had any late meetings. I confronted him when he got home and he told me that he had been spending time with his ex and was in love with her. He moved out three days ago and I've been unable to leave the apartment. I'm so depressed and I still love him. I've been bawling my eyes out for days just hoping he would just talk to me, but I know it's over. I could really use some comfort food and I don't have the money to buy anything. I've tried to budget rent and utilities and with just my income, I'll barely have enough for food and gas to get to work. I know I have to get out of this bed, look for a new place and get my head together. Right now, I don't have the will to do anything. I hope someone can treat me to some pizza please. This would mean the world to me. Thank you."
598	False	a	Ottawa Ontario, Canada
599	False	a	After reading some of these posts, it really warms my heart to know there are such great people out there in the world. Figured I'd throw my request out there and see what happens.  I just finished up my junior year at the University of Alabama, I'm double majoring in Marketing and Finance, so I've had to take out a whole lump of loans to pay for everything. My mom and dad help out as much as they can, but I'm the youngest of 4 and they are tapped out at this point.  I'm working as a summer intern at a local law firm, but of course they don't have to pay me anything, so I'm essentially an indentured servant to them :(  But I'll scrape by, I always have, and always will, but if anyone had it in their heart and could manage it, I would love a pizza over the weekend. I've got some girlfriends coming over, and for some reason a wine and pizza night sounds pretty great right now.  Roll Tide 
600	True	a	We're planning a move across the country in about 3 weeks. We've got some money saved for the trip and getting set up out there, but we're pretty limited on funds now. Any pizza would be greatly appreciated. We're both hungry and any scraps will be fed to our two cats, who just happen to love pizza too.  [Here](http://imgur.com/tOHAK) they are right now. Look at those eyes, gleaming with the anticipation of cheesy delicious pizza. 
601	False	a	Really need a pizza been eating ramen. and the occasional kraft dinner.
602	True	a	Hate to lay the sad story down thick, but can if needed. Not much of an artist, but will send a pic of three little thumbs up if we get lucky enough!
603	True	a	Hi, folks. My friend and I are starving because our cafeteria isn't open this late and we have no money to buy food off campus. Tell me if I'm doing this incorrectly. :D
604	False	a	Currently on my last 12 hour night shift and finish at 08:00AM, I've forgotten my lunch and it will be a long night being hungry all night. I was hoping that a pizza would be able to soften the blow and fill a hole!
605	False	a	Single mom in central Pennsylvania looking for some help. I only have enough food in the house for my children. I don't have any money right now. I always make sure they have what they need, even if I have to go without. I am getting grocery money on Friday. I would really appreciate a pizza to help lift my spirits. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
606	False	a	i know it's a new account but i can do the verification thing i seen this posted on facebook and thought i would give it a shot.. no sad story or nothing just first night in my apartment after leaving my husband... and wanna give the kids something special.. they are still adjusting to not having him around.. i have a phone so i can take pics i just don't know how to get them on here. if someone wants to help that would be AWESOME! if not or if you do thanks for all you do for the people on here.. it's a great deed :) 
607	False	a	I'm a lurker, not a poster, so I'm not expecting much - but I thought I'd try my hand anyway! I really should go for a proper English breakfast, but I massively wrecked my knee when I was wrecked last night and now I can't even make it round the corner to the shop. No worries if it doesn't happen! Cheers :)
608	False	a	I've has been going through a bit of a rough patch financially and my cupboards looking pretty empty. Used all of of my savings to pay for my school for next semester. Thankfully, I'm going to be starting a new job tomorrow, but it'll be a while until my first check comes around. I think a pizza would really make things look a little brighter around here and be an awesome change from my oatmeal diet! I'll definitely try to return the favor come paycheck time.
609	False	a	Starving due to unexpected expense. Have been for a little over a wk now and would love a pizza to carry me over to payday. Will gladly return the favor when payday comes. Willing to do almost any task(nothing to hurt myself or others) Thank you so much in advance!!
610	False	a	Me and my friend are in desperate need of some food this evening, and we can't afford one of our own. We're stuck at our computers working on finals and a pizza would really lift our spirits!
611	False	a	hey r.a.o.p, were two seventeen year olds looking for something to eat. only problem is between the two of us we have a whole seven dollars. if you all would be so kind as to PM me il get you back a pizza when i come across some money. thanks and have a good day!
612	False	a	Hey my name is Andrew. Currently i'm unemployed and stream video games via twitch.tv full time to try and make some money here and there. I live in the Denver, Colorado area roughly.  I live at home with my mom after a few heavy life incidents led me to leave my job and move back home.  Streaming hasn't been making me much lately and i've been pretty broke, had to quit smoking cold turkey and can't exactly afford food at the moment either.  The last few days i've been really achy and sick and my mom didn't get child support for whatever  reason so we are scraping by until we get food stamps in a few days.  I've been looking for a job and working on getting my GED to help out on that front but no luck so far seeing as how I can't commute downtown every day.  If anyone would be cool and get me a pizza or something, that would be pretty legit.  Not really sure what else to put here, so sorry if anyone is looking for more info i'd be happy to edit my post for whatever reason.   Edit: I saw a contest for some bad MS paint art, i like to draw champions from League of Legends in paint for people who donate to my stream, so i'd be happy to draw one or more for someone who donates a pizza. (Doesn't have to be league related, but i'm terrible.) 
613	False	a	I live in Ohio
614	True	a	I've been incredibly broke the last couple of weeks, even had to bounce a $25 check last week to get some food. I've been without food for the last two days and I get paid Friday (finally!). Ugh. Please help me out!  My fridge! http://i.imgur.com/bL8RO.jpg, http://i.imgur.com/QrGgL.jpg
615	False	a	I unfortunately am having to spend the holidays alone, which included my birthday, this december. I made sure the fiancee could go see her family that is visiting from korea and i stayed home with our pup and am voluntarily working the holidays so that coworkers can be with family since i am unable to this year. I used my last funds to get the fiancee to her grandpas and won't have any more until after the new year. A pizza would make a really awesome meal for me and would keep me from having to munch on plain rice for atleast tonight and tomorrow :)
616	True	a	Throwaway for obvious reasons. So, I finally got a job!!! I really want to celebrate with my friends and keep my spirits up. I would love whoever could hook us up with a pizza please. I start on Monday and won't get my first check for at least 3 weeks.   I've been so down in the dumps wondering where my next meal would come from or how I would even get it. I've come from having a furnished living space to bare walls and a dream of being able to support myself again. I thought about committing suicide because I just couldn't see any end in sight to this.   I want to thank my friends who stood by me and helped me in my search. A pizza can't repay them for all they've done, but it's definitely a start. If you're in the Santa Fe area, you are more than welcomed to join us. I hope someone can help me do something nice for my friends. Thank you.
617	False	a	Hiya~  This isn't my main account, but I have some friends from real-life who know my main, and I want to keep this private. I'm using an old throwaway, as I figured it might help to prove a little bit that I really *am* an active reditor. (Promise! :3) I used this throwaway to publish a story to /r/nosleep that got a fair amount of attention. (Check it out if you're interested.)  Anyway, I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and I've been feeling like absolute shit for the past week, and my family doesn't even get it. They just say that I'm screwing up and I feel like I can't take it anymore. (╥﹏╥)  Some comfort food would be really nice, if some kind person (≥\^.\^≤) might be willing to buy me a pizza, to go along with my movie. I'll even write you a story about something you choose, if you want.  Thanks!~  **EDIT**: Oh, and fyi, I've never received pizza on my main account either. O.O
618	False	a	Hey, I was wondering if there was anyway that someone could PM me or write on this post in response to get me a free pizza from Dominoes or something. I am starving and a college student please help!
619	False	a	I don't want to post from my main, but I've been a redditor for some time now. I live with my boyfriend and roommate, and both are in between jobs right now. I've known my roommate since high school and I know that if I ask them to leave, they will have nowhere else to go. I'd love to have a roommate or boyfriend for that matter that doesn't stress me out and put so much pressure on me when it comes to money. I should actually be saying MY MONEY, but I never get to see any of it. My income goes straight to bills and food.   I am coming to a point where I no longer see both of the people that I live with as just having a hard time. They've been unemployed since February and June, and I've been paying for everything for months. I really can't take it anymore. I can't even put away enough money to take a trip to get away from everything and everyone. Between work and school, I am really at my limit.  I'm hoping that another redditor who has been here before in this situation will help me with something other than canned vegetables for dinner (pretty please? :D). I would love a pizza and it would pretty much make my entire year, because this would be the only nice thing I've gotten. If someone is able to help, you would be a hero! I should also mention that I'm in NYC (Brooklyn stand up!). 
620	False	a	Live on very limited income just can't afford a pizza right now and would love to have a pizza.
621	True	a	Hi, I'm Hungry. (joke here) I would love a pizza of some kind. I live in Shreveport LA so the pizza joints are Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, Dominos, and Johnny's pizza (Local chain)  I don't have the money to afford a pizza nor any meals for the next 2 weeks. I won't starve or anything. I have plenty of rice and soup. I just want a real meal.  I don't have much to offer but I have a website cazes.tumblr.com and I make crazy art thingies. I'll make you some if you can gift me with pizza.   I would be eternally grateful for anything you could provide.   Love, drcazes 
622	True	a	I need an e-gift card for Dominos, I will pay it forward as soon as possible. My situation: Lost my job a few weeks back and just ran out of money yesterday, I have a job interview tomorrow and I would really like to not arrive at the interview while starved. 
623	False	a	I've been anorexic for a couple years, and am in the process of recovery. My friend thinks eating pizza will bring me back to love food, but I don't have money at the moment. Whoever could send a pizza, I will repay you in 2 weeks, when I get paid. Thanks :D
624	False	a	Hopefully I'll have a job very soon and will be able to buy pizza for a nice redditor, but as of now I've got a little over $20 to my name. I'm very hungry and pizza would sure beat more campbell's. 
625	True	a	My friend has a foot condition that he was born with. He was operated on one of his feet last year, and they just finished the other one yesterday! He needs to go through a recovery period of two weeks before he can start walking again, and I'd like to brighten up his day with a pizza because I can't visit him today (when two of my other friends are going).  He's not in any real need, but I think it'd be a nice thing to do since he's just an all-around great guy and taking this like a champ (and always willing to offer us food!)
626	True	a	Upstate SC, she would really appreciate the gift and it would save her time from cooking! thank you RAOP!  EDIT: Thank you jimwll, you are a true hero to the people!
627	False	a	My friend told me about this and suggested it. I'm recently kicked out and staying with a friend for a while. I literally have less then ten dollars to my name and the last time i ate something was over a day and a half ago. I'm just seeing if anyone could help me out. I'm located in tennessee. Thanks in advance and hopefully someone could help me out
628	False	a	Hey Pizza people, I've just finished making sure that my neighborhood is ready for the upcoming hurricane, but in doing so, I had to spend my paycheck on supplies and such, so I'm looking for the kindness of one person to send a pizza and I'll be eternally grateful and I'll repay it back later. :)  Much thanks and here's hoping everything will work out!
629	False	a	"You know the feeling. Home alone besides the company of homework, three dogs, and the ""nothing to eat"" feeling. Will pass it on when I get the chance :)"
630	False	a	Recently among our other financial woes we lost our car to a colony of homeless people under the I10 bridge in New Orleans.  In addition to smashing almost all the glass and beating the sides with what we believe was a golf club, they also stole my SO's suits which were in the backseat.  While we noticed several of these fine citizens sporting some ill fitting business attire, we chose not to approach.  We found the backseat around 50 yards away, but decided to leave that behind as well since a couple of very friendly men were in the process of making it their fuck pad.  Everything that could physically be taken was, but they left us something in return!  They took a big poop in the trunk!  Alas we miss the Mitsubishi Lancer, and the only thing that could possibly dissipate our grief is a delicious hot pizza.   Can provide pictures of car as well as pictures of our really cute dog.  Thank you to fordgawn for the delicious Bacon Pizza!!!!
631	False	a	First time requester here. I know it's pretty cheesy but I really love this girl, I want her to remember that I'll never stop caring. Recently, her car has been totaled so I haven't really been seeing her much like I used to. It's been about two months so far and every week I come by on the bus to see her and spend a couple days with her. She lives about 30 miles away so It's a definite I need to bus it trip. This week I managed to find her a ride here for our six months together and she's excited cause I planned it all out for her. I'm the first boyfriend shes ever had. She never dated anyone in high school so she got lucky with not having to deal with childish drama. We're going to Frank and Sons in the morning (her first time there), coming back to my place and relaxing with a nice massage (she loves them)  while we finish up our last four episode of Game of thrones season three. I have an intention to cook, but since I've been taking the bus. My funds are low and I haven't been able to buy anything to cook with. So I'm stuck with Easy Mac and a cake that I baked for her. A pizza would really help me out so I can at least buy food for the rest of the weekend so we can eat and if I'm lucky have some left over for Handel's (best ice cream ever). I just want to give her a relaxing day and weekend since she's been working so hard to pay for a new car. Thanks for considering to read all of that if you did!
632	True	a	I am sure there are a ton of starving college students out there, but I am practically at my lowest right now. After the rent and bills, I have $10 dollars in my bank account. I work at an organic chemistry stockroom, and the higher ups are constantly finding a way to lower the amount of hours I can write on my time sheet. I work more than 40 hours a week, and I can only put in 20 hours. So all my financial plans from the beginning of the Summer went down the drain... I am hungry, and I would love some comfort food.  So that's my story. It would be nice to hear from anyone right now. Thanks for listening.
633	False	a	Hey Reddit, I'm a 20 year old female, I'm currently starving or at least it feels that way. I haven't ate anything since yesterday morning. I tried to go to the pantry today but they aren't open until tomorrow and tomorrow I wont need help because I get my check. I work a full-time job and currently drained my savings for a car so I didn't have to ride the metro back and forth to work.  I've been on Reddit for over a year and helped a lot of people out in r/assistance, if someone could help me out it would mean a lot, I'm currently extremely dizzy and I think it's due to the lack of food. Please PM for proof and my real account name, I'd be glad to pay it back or pay it forward.   Edit: If someone would still like to help I'd appreciate it, I can't pick up my check until 5PM tomorrow so it would be awesome to wake up to something.   Thanks.
634	True	a	Just had to shell out most of my paycheck on 2 new tires for my car, and now I am very low on $ till I get paid on Friday. I have plenty of baby food for my son for the week, but I am 7 months pregnant and hungry :) If anyone could help out, I would really appreciate it! I can provide verification. Thanks!   Edit: Im in Northern VA
635	True	a	Pizza is my feel better food, but I'm low on cash right now. Last night I broke up with my live-in boyfriend of 2 years because I found out that he had been interacting with his ex in a way that was less than desirable. I don't really feel like going in to the details because I'm still processing everything. This is the worst I've ever felt in my life and I just want to curl up with a pizza and have a good cry.
636	False	a	It's just me and my brother in the house tonight and there is nothing exciting to eat. Not to mention neither of us can be bothered to cook anything tonight and it would be great to just chill with a pizza.
637	True	a	EDIT! Thanks to jetboyterp! He provided us with some nice grub for the night. It amazes me to no end to see the kindness still left in some people, and pushes me forward to keep providing that same kindness to others whenever I am able. I'll follow up with some pictures of some pizza!  Hello fellow Redditors. I'm probably gonna rant and make a bigger deal of this than I should, and I'll try to keep it short and simple. But let me mention, I am NOT one to ask for assistance. But there comes times when we must swallow our pride.  I have a small family of three, just my daughter, my wife, and myself. I'm a mechanic by trade, and make an acceptable amount of money...normally. The last month has been very rough, with work being slow and hours being cut. We are in an apartment that costs us $325/wk, and that is killing us. We've had to cut off both phones, and recently our car took a turn for the worst and left us without transportation.  I've been able to keep food in the house, up until the last week or so. Mostly thanks to foodstamps, but those funds have run out. This last week I've had to pay back some small debts to my boss and father, and it's really hurt.  Also, our stove at this apartment doesn't work, so we've had to basically resort to microwave, cold prep foods, and a single burner hotplate. My cupboards and fridge are empty, short of some month old ice cream and leftovers that we've been too lazy to throw away. My family is hungry, but just for the day.  So here is my request, which I will counter with an offer. In exchange for a pizza, I will buy 2 other people in need a pizza in the near future. This is my way of setting aside the guilt of asking, and expanding the assistance of RAOP. I can provide any and all proof and verification needed. And whatever happens, I'd still like to thank RAOP for all their awesomeness.  NOTE: Come Monday, I can get my paycheck advanced to me. Yesterday we just barely slid by, and all will be well from Moday on. I've got a second job that I start Tuesday at. It's just rather...depressing(maybe even desperate) feeling to be hungry, have an empty wallet, and feel like there is nothing I can do. Thanks again Reddit. :)  EDIT: I'm so sorry, I completely forgot to put my location, and I kept saying it in my head. :P Anyways, I'm in South Florida, right by Ft. Lauderdale.  
638	True	a	I'm in Kent, Ohio. I haven't had a meal in two days for financial reasons. I don't get off work until 5 so the bank will be closed. I'd appreciate a pizza. I will pay it forward.
639	False	a	I'm short on funds until my next paycheck, which doesn't come until next week. I don't get enough hours at my job, I live in such a small town that there aren't many options for a different job. I don't drive, so I can't get myself to the grocery store very often. I've been living on ramen for most of this month. I can't say how much I would appreciate a pizza. I didn't even know this existed, and I feel bad for asking. This isn't what I do. This will be the only time I ever request, that is a guarantee. I hope someone will help me.
640	False	a	Bonus: bees. http://imgur.com/a/zjHQs 
641	False	a	My wife was layed off 6 months ago. I do side jobs and it's been hard to find work. With 4 children ages 10, 8, 5, 4 it has been really hard trying to make ends meet. I can't remember the last time we had pizza.  Pizza would be a real blessing. Thanks for reading.
642	False	a	Well to cut to the chase I am living with HCM (hypertrophic cardiomyapthy) and I have been having some trouble breathing lately.  Being uninsured, I go to the urgent care center and the doc tells me that I suffered a mild heart attack sometime last week.  It hit me kind of rough because I haven't had an episode in years and I've been really healthy. All my family is 8+ hours away and to be honest it feels good to just tell someone in general.    Anything reassuring would really boost my spirits/confidence in the matter if only an 'it's going to be ok.'  Thanks in advance and once my spirits pick up, I promise to pay it forward.
643	True	a	She insists on cooking for our family every night because she thinks it's her job. She's been working a lot of overtime though lately and I just wish I could surprise her and our family with a pizza to start off her well deserved week end.  Found a deal at pizzahut for a 5.55 one topping large, and tried to round up change, but fell well short.
644	False	a	so i was recently hired at two different places over the last week, started one job at a sandwich shop last Monday and start at this awesome gourmet pizza place called Pagliacci here in Seattle next Wednesday and after three months of unemployment it couldn't come quickly enough. Wells Fargo literally closed my checking account because it was dormant for three months! Im a hardworking guy who will be working 9am to 12am doubles next week, the recent unemployment has just been a crappy setback for me! pretty difficult. I've been going to foodbanks and primarily dumpster diving to survive, I would absolutely love some pizza and could pay it forward in the future, maybe when my discount kicks in at the new job?
645	False	a	i was gonna tell a story about how my wife cheated on me and threw me out of the house and i left my wallet inside, but instead i just want to see if i can get a pizza randomly. i live in fremont ohio
646	False	a	dear seattlites, and even those who live far away, I ask you just for one second of your time. I swear it wont take long, and I swear I wont ask much. All I'm pleading with you for, is a nice hot vegetable/meat covered sweet sensation bringing belly filling pizza pie. We are a house of 4 friends who due to unlucky circumstances have found ourselves jobless and on the verge of losing our home. This is all we ask, is for some food for our stomachs so we may have energy when setting out on our quest and turning in resumes. Our sweet loving dog Oliver has begun to suffer as we have resorted to eating his dog food and his supply is slowly dwindling. Please dearest humans with money in your pockets, dearest humans with food on your table, share your wealth and increase our health. Love surely, the inhabitants of the house on the corner.
647	True	a	i would love nothing more than a large pizza so i can cuddle on the couch with the boys and pop in a movie.  thanks so much in advance, it would mean the world to me at this moment.  feeling a little overwhelmed. 
648	False	a	~~I have managed to pay off tuition with 17$ left in my checking account and 200$ worth of credit card debt. I have been eating ramen noodles for the past week and would love some sort of meat on a pizza. Also lost my job and trying to find another so i need the money I have left for gas.. Help me RAOP, you're my only hope~~  Thanks to Stalked_Like_Corn, he is freaking awesome.
649	False	a	It's cereal or this. I have zero culinary skills and no money. It would be nice to have some pizza to feed family.
650	False	a	EDIT: Forgot to include location, which is CHICAGO SUBURBS!  My parents just went out to dinner, and I just realized that we aren't getting groceries until tomorrow, so I'm prettttty hungry.  These allergies are pretty awful, but I have some unfinished video games that I can revisit while I'm here, so it's not all bad.  But can you awesome people of RAoP make it better?  :D  It would make my night to be saved by reddit.   P.S. I've never done this before, so I don't really know how the verification system works.  I'd be happy to use it if you explained it to me though :)
651	True	a	I'm intimidated to ask for food like this, but my husband works five days a week to support the two of us and our puppy. He always does a great job managing bills, including our puppy, gas, etc. We try to buy enough groceries to last us the two weeks before pay-day and in between he gives plasma for extra cash.  This week he received a vacation for all of the days he's gone in early or when it was his day off and we've been waiting for Thursday (he gives plasma Thurs/Sat) for a night to finally have money for some good food.  On his way home from the Biolife center a few minutes ago he called me and said he was stuck at a gas station because he tried using the Biolife card to get gas. The pump automatically charges a card $75 dollars, I believe, and then puts back whatever you didn't use. My husband pulled the pump out to use it, realized the car was too far back, and put the pump back to pull the car forward. Somehow by doing that something got cancelled and the money is being withheld. When he called the card company they said it could be up to 7 days before it goes back into the account. My husband had to call his boss and ask if he could use the business card for $3 in gas to get home that he'd pay back Monday.  It would be so amazing if someone would provide us that awesome Thursday night we had planned. The favor *will* be returned by Saturday when he gives plasma again! We've never done this so if you're willing to walk us through how to go about receiving and then giving back when able it would be greatly appreciated!  **Edit**: We're in Texas! :)
652	False	a	I'm broke till friday and shes a full-time student. I can pay it forward on friday. I also have a few coupons for papa johns so im not looking for much just to get by. 
653	False	a	Hello, I was wondering if maybe somebody out there could help me out...I know these people that got kicked out of their house, they were going to take their dog to the pound since they themselves had no place to live and i didnt want the dog to be put down or live out in the cold in utah (he would die he is tiny), they were feeding him horrible food and couldnt afford dog food so i spent of the last of my money on gas and dog food and a leash for him and now i dont get paid until thursday  was hoping somebody could help me out and i can pay it back this friday   I dont know if this will work but here is a photo of the little guy, his name is otis: (his name was gizmo but i changed it)  https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&amp;ik=73f87cebbc&amp;view=att&amp;th=133a31a88fcafd49&amp;attid=0.1&amp;disp=inline&amp;realattid=1385474349507543040-1&amp;zw
654	True	a	Hello!  I'm Riley and I'm requesting pizza for my family.  It'd sure be swell if someone could help us out. We aren't totally starving, but it sure would be a treat. I'm a senior in high school and I work part-time at a grocer. I have 3 little brothers. Conner is 14 and the twins, Ryan and Brando,n are 10. I don't know when my mom was diagnosed with MS, but she worked every day until recently. My dad is a carpenter, but was laid off and has been doing wallpaper for a year now.  I'm going to college next year (don't know where yet) so I can get a good job and take care of my family. They deserve it. I pitch it where I can, but most of my money is going to car insurance right now.   We're managing over here, but it'd be so great if someone could help get us even just a pizza. My parents do a lot for me and helping them with one meal would make a big difference.  Thank you for taking this time to read this.  P.S. No I'm not cutting school; I'm on my friends computer during study.  I'M REALLY SORRY IF I REPLIED TO EVERYONE A BUNCH OF TIMES. MY COMPUTER IS KINDA OLD AND SLOW AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED
655	True	a	"Hey guys, I've been broke as a joke the last couple weeks. Raided the pantry completely and have made plenty of ""canned food and rice"" surprises. Last of the monies went in the gas tank and I'm now down to the last cup of applesauce and could use a solid meal and leftovers for the next couple days. I have payment coming this Tuesday/Wednesday and will gladly return the favor to my offerer!  Thanks!"
656	False	a	"Finally created an account on reddit for this post alone, basically the situation is that I was paid on friday, and my bank (Arizona Federal Credit Union) has placed a hold my payroll check for a couple of days now. I was told that it would be included in my ""available balance"" 6pm MST, however it has still not shown up. The banks are now closed, my account in still negative, and I am stuck at work till 11 pm. I was counting on ordering something once the funds were available, but alas I will be hungry tonight. Unless there is a kind soul out there who responds to this message.   P.S. - This is the first time I have done something like this, and would love to repay the favor for someone tomorrow. Its a lot easier on my conscious if I consider this a loan, rather than a freebie. Thanks again!"
657	False	a	Not the best week as you can see from the title. Money stresses making my relationships fall apart and struggling to get back on my feet. Pizza would not only cheer me up but fill my belly. Any help is appreciated : )
658	True	a	The title pretty much says it all. I start working at my new job this upcoming week and am completely broke until then. My power has been cut off so I can't even cook things on a stovetop.  The neighbors in the apartment next to me have been kind enough to let me run an extension cable from one of their wall outlets near the door to a power strip in the living room so I can set up my computer (was putting in applications), lamp, and charge my phone.  Shit's rough and I'd just like a pizza or two I can live off of for a couple days or half week.
659	True	a	My job barely pays the bills, my food budget for the week is spent, and she's been putting extra hours in at her new retail job... so she can buy/ship all 5 of her sisters(plus parents, grandparents, ect) Christmas gifts this year since we live in a different state and won't be able to get together like they do every year.  Even if it's just a simple $5 Little Caesar's it would make her day to be able to be able to 'eat out' instead of the same meals I cook(she works  evenings) day in and out :P
660	True	a	Life is rough as is but especially when your job shorts your check 8 hours.  I get paid again Wednesday though and that check will have the hours I was missing from last pay day added on.  I'm in Dallas, the Cowboys scored over 20 points last night and Papa John's has a promo for 50% off.  With half off, I figure I can be fed until Wednesday.  Help?  I will definitely pay it forward.  :EDIT:  Request fulfilled.
661	False	a	My last final is tomorrow, but due to Drum Corps stuff, I'll probably be living here away from home until next Monday. I'm out of university money and real money, spent the last of it on bills and a meal the other day.   I understand if this isn't going to happen, just hoping that some person out there will want to donate a bit of love to a Redditor and his friend.   If anyone can do this, I  live in Greensboro, NC
662	False	a	Hell week is finally over and a pizza would be nice to help forget the possible failing. Actually, randomly receiving a pizza from some unknown person would be just the boost I need to forget this past week.
663	False	a	If anyone is interested in my story here it is. I was kicked out of my parent's home a few months ago for religious reasons and I'm struggling to make ends meet living on my own. My mormon parents don't talk to me and don't want to have anything to do with me after they found out I'm not going on my mission. I have a job and a room but my hours were weekends only last month and I'm completely broke until the end of this week when I get paid and even then, money is going to be tight for the next few months. I was not really prepared to live on my own like this (I just recently turned 20) and I'm really struggling. I'm trying to eat as little as I can to save as much money as I can and pizza would be amazing right now. (I'm in Toronto, Ontario)
664	False	a	My power was out for about 3 hours earlier this afternoon. I keep trying to watch DVD's (Twister...I mean when in Rome, right?) but as soon as I get halfway in the power either flickers on and off or stays off for an extended period of time. I don't feel up to going out for food either since I've been sick for about 3 days now and Hurricane Irene is being a bitch...  Thank you all!
665	False	a	Hey RAoP  This is a throwaway account but I'd be happy to PM you from my real account as verification. I've given before and never received.  First up I'd like to say that pizza is NOT necessary and we won't starve without it. Not even a bit. We've got some leftovers in the freezer and a bunch of odds and ends in the cupboards and even a bunch of friends who'd take us out to dinner or have us over if we asked (but we'd feel bad asking because we're old enough to be meant to be beyond this!). So, absolutely no worries if no-one can give.   I'm asking because a bunch of unexpected grown up expenses just ambushed us. My boyfriend's grandfather died unexpectedly and we wanted to go to the funeral - but it was 5 hours away and we didn't have a car. So we bought a cheap car and made it to the funeral, but it turns out that car ownership is super expensive. Rego is nearly $1000! Add insurance, NRMA membership (needed cos we weren't sure whether our little bomb of a car would make the drive and we didnt want to be stranded in the australian outback forever), random fees for vehicle inspections and more random fees just for existing add up to be the value of the car again! What. The. Hell. (yes, I *have* lived a sheltered life, thank you for asking.)  Add that to the billion and one other things we're saving up for/need to pay (rent, bills, house deposit, wedding, honeymoon maybe, helping our families) and it's come as a bit of a shock to our financial system :P We literally have $0.67 in the bank and a bit of change in cash until pay day. This is an odd and disconcerting feeling.   What would pizza mean to us? Laughter and joy. The pleasure of knowing that there are good people who care about strangers. A memory to carry with us both when things are hard and when things are good and we can give again. A small easing of financial stress for the next few days.   I might also pull the request later because like I said - it's most definitely not a do or die type situation. And anyway, my credit card's taken such a pounding this week, what harm is pizza going to do? :P  But thanks for reading anyway, RAoP!  Also, please and thank you ;)
666	True	a	Just found out I got a job I just interviewed for but I don't get paid for another 2 weeks. My wife and I have been on brown rice and dry cereal for a while now. Anyone willing to get us a medium or large pepperoni pizza would be appreciated. Once I get my first check I will kindly repay the favor.   Edit: Pizza already received and currently being enjoyed. Many thanks godbless this fucking site. I love you guys.
667	False	a	We will compose and record ( not professionally but in a decent manner) an original song that you can pick the title, topic, and even give us other songs you want us to use as inspiration! This will include Lyrics, Vocals, Drums ( electronic) Guitar, and Bass The song will be sent within a week of pizza!
668	False	a	Hey guys,  I'm a student at Virginia Tech. Currently broke; would appreciate a pizza. Thanks!
669	False	a	I don't get my loan for 2 weeks, can't stand the sight of rice anymore. Can anyone gift me something with flavour for a change?  Edit: going to bed now, my rice was terrible.
670	False	a	we are cleaning/baby proofing our house for new foster kids. we wont have time to stop cleaning to go out and buy food and don't really have to money to spend on more then just cheap food.being as new baby necessities are very pricey and. we want to get this done and don't want to slow down our momentum and pizza we can eat as we are working. thank you in advance :)
671	False	a	Just spent my last $10 on food for my fish, and only have $1.92 in my bank account until Friday at midnight. If anyone can spare a pizza pie today, I will gladly pie it forward on Friday when I get paid. 
672	False	a	I posted yesterday but had no luck, sorry for the repost.   I recently moved closer to work, and lost my job, so now I have to try and pay bills instead of buying furniture, so I live in an empty apartment and could just really use a pizza. I know my account is new, i was directed here by a friend. I live in Oak Ridge TN. Thank you.
673	False	a	Basically I had unexpected expenses this month out of money and desperate for a pizza.   I Have a Tera account with level 48 Beserker and the account has founder status.Its not much but only thing i have right now that i can live without. Eating is much higher on my priority list right now than playing Tera.   If you don't want the account I will be happy to pay it forward to someone this friday when I get my paycheck.
674	False	a	House sitting Uncle's house. They mostly have health food, and I'm craving something unhealthy.
675	False	a	Elkin, NC
676	True	a	Proof - http://imgur.com/a/ra8GW  My father just recently got his 3 year sobriety coin, i planned on celebrating today but there was a problem at my work and now i wont be paid until monday, if there is someone out there kind enough to help us id be indescribably grateful.
677	False	a	I woke up yesterday to Marla gasping for breath, and Mia was just grooming her. Now Mia doesn't know what to do and honestly either do I. Ugh.  We live in Tacoma, WA.
678	False	a	Hey guys,  My story is no where as bad as everyone else's on here, but I would love to catch a break from someone if they are willing and able.  I was laid off last week from my job of 5 years, they are downsizing, which I guess means my boss is taking a bigger paycheck this year and I was expendable.  For the cherry on top, my old '93 Honda Civic broke down on me, it's sitting in the shop, and I don't want to pay for that POS to be fixed, but I have no other offers.  I'm a single guy, no girlfriend or wife or children that I know of, so I don't have a lot of mouths to feed, but I would love to at least stuff my face with something greasy and warm tonight and wallow in my sorrows.  Thanks reddit, you guys are all awesome.  
679	False	a	I started my new job on the 30th and we only get paid on the 15th and the last day of the month! I'm out of food and starving! I don't have any food till the 15th. Would like help please! 
680	False	a	Hey RAOP, we're not starving, but we're strapped this month and we've eaten chicken every way we can think of for almost three weeks straight, trying to stretch the dollars to the max. My niece, nephew and sister have a hankerin for some Dominoes tonight. I'd be grateful for a couple of pies for dinner tonight.
681	False	a	Having a throwback LAN party with couter-strike, diablo, warcraft ect. Running low on chips and hoping for something with more substance to fuel us the rest of the night. Location, NY USA Thanks for the help!
682	False	a	A series of unexpected expenses and some irresponsible account balancing has left me quite hungry.  It's days like this I wish I was a server!  Would be in serious debt to anyone willing to help out.
683	False	a	"We have three kids, two with autism, and one of them has been throwing a violent tantrum since about 8pm. Our townhouse is very small, and the other two kids can't be in their beds right now for safety reasons, so they're ""going to sleep"" in the rec room. Obviously they're still awake. I don't get paid until Thursday, and we could really use a pizza to make this less awful on the family."
684	False	a	I'm craving pizza right now, but no way to aquire.. I don't usually take handouts, let alone blatantly ask for them, but pizza...
685	True	a	I live in Sherman Oaks, California and have like no food in my small apartment. Gonna get hungry when smoking so it would be great if someone could send some pizza. Picture: http://imgur.com/lct7R  I would be super thankful to whoever would send pizza, and we can pm the exact location and address.
686	True	a	Hi, I am a married college student with no job or income, my wife doesn't have one either. Right now we have about 40 bucks to spend for the rest of the month until we get our school financial aid in the last week of August.  As I mentioned before it was my birthday a few days ago and no one bought me pizza :( sad day. On top of that I just went to go get the cheesecake my wife made for me for my birthday and someone ate it before I could. We are living with her parents at the moment because it is close to the school we both attend, but we recently moved here and haven't been able to find jobs yet, the only money we have been living on is the left over financial aid from last spring semester.  We can make it the rest of the month food wise, but not pizza wise. Without Pizza how will we survive?  EDIT: Location is around Sacramento California.   Also our favorite type of Pizza is a deal from Papa Johns we regularly get when we have money that costs around 15-20 bucks. I can't remember the exact price.
687	False	a	Looking for some pizza to help me with my cash issues. With the amount of time i have to dedicate to 4th year studies, i have been unable to find a job and am now literally paying for it. 
688	True	a	Title says it all mostly.  We spent that much because two of my classes required a revised edition of a book that started print this year and that came with a code for online software so we can do our homework online.  They were both $200+ each.   We literally have no money for food in our room other then Ramen Noodles and our cafeteria sucks.  They literally make more vegan options for lunch dinner then they do non vegan food.  Its horrible.  Could a kind redditor please help us out and provide us with some good ol Pizza for once?  The past 2 months have been miserable.  
689	False	a	I can't draw.. at all but I'd really love a pizza for me and my roommate tonight and I thought I'd try and cheer him up with some since he is pretty down today. I can try and draw you something in MS paint? I don't have kittens or cute cat pictures I can show so sorry to dissapoint :(
690	True	a	I had posted a request in food pantry and it was suggested maybe to come here. I just was needing help for tomorrow, I will be able to shop on Tuesday. It's just me and 3 kids and yes I'm new and I know that's frowned upon. If you can help I can send you the money back this week. If you can't help please don't be mean, I'm not used to having to ask for help and it's hard for me. 
691	False	a	Parents are at a party until much later - they forgot to leave us cash to buy dinner.  We're snacking on dry cereal but pizza would be great :D
692	True	a	We are in Cambridge, MD. I'm a single father and am broke until next Friday because of some car issues the past week. My daughter and I would love to nosh on some pizza tonight, but I can't afford the pie! Definitely looking to pay it forward this coming Friday when the cash comes back around.
693	False	a	None of us have money for a pizza and we are no where near one of our houses to get any food. Somebody suggested trying to see if we can get anything.
694	False	a	Would absolutely love a pizza this evening...not feelin' too hot, no pun intended and don't have the energy to cook. I'd be happy with a knuckle sandwich w/mayo about now.
695	False	a	[EDIT] I live in Mesa, AZ 85201 &lt;- thanks to [alliOops](http://www.reddit.com/user/alliOops) for the heads up!  I know there are guys worse off than me, so for what I have I am grateful. I have food, just haven't had pizza in too damn long...  So, here's where I'm at: I got fired because my boss found out I disproved of his business ethics, and then denied my unemployment. I have $3 to my name, and if I had $5 I'd get a Little Ceaser's pizza.  I don't care if it's just cheese or what - I'm not picky. Would just love some pizza right about now. I could go on about more crap-stuff in my life, but I don't like thinking about it.
696	False	a	My boyfriend and I have been unemployed 7 months and 3 months, respectively. We aren't starving but we don't really want to eat beans for dinner tonight. It would be a huge treat to have a tasty pizza instead. We would really, really appreciate it.
697	False	a	I'm sitting at home contemplating eating a tunafish and ketchup sandwich because that's all I have left in my pantry.  I work at a restaurant where I make 9.75 an hour but I'm currently barely paying for my rent (which includes my gas and water bills). I just paid rent on the 7th after having scrapped together the tips I make off the grill I work to pay for rent.  I've got a total of 2.71 in my bank account and I don't get paid until next Tuesday.  I've got the next 2 days off and while I will be able to buy some food Saturday with my grill tips I only usually make about $15 bucks after a 6 hour shift.    If anyone would be kind of enough to fulfill my offer I will be back next Tuesday to return the favor to some lucky human or humans. If I don't return the favor by Tuesday.  I will post a picture of my shame to /r/pics explaining my unconscionable behavior.
698	True	a	I've been unemployed but working odd jobs. I worked a job yesterday which I thought paid up front - it did not. Now I'm sitting at home dreaming of pizza (literally, I took a nap and dreamt there was pizza in my fridge, but woke up to nothing but leftover pasta). Will pay forward when I get a chance!
699	True	a	2011 is just not my year. Can anyone help a girl out that's down in the dumps? Ill have a few spare bucks next friday to pay it forward. It would be amazing if someone can help me out for dinner, cause im disgustingly broke. Please and thank you
700	False	a	As the title says, I would be more than happy to pay it back/forward when I get paid next week. 
701	False	a	Well this has been a let down and a half of a birthday. I'm 35, and sat at home on my computer watching my 3 year old daughter. The missus is 39 weeks pregnant and bedridden with blood pressure issues that had her in hospital for two weeks. There's no possibility of a celebration or even friends popping by as my work recently changed shift patterns and my mates are all on nights. Deciding to at least salvage something from the day i decided to defrost the freezer and threw my back out moving it to get at the power point. The final topping? Payday is 3 days away and i can't even order a takeaway for us this evening, resulting in me having to hop around like a bloody screaming ape to make food. Help me Reddit, you're my only hope!  (re-posted to fix the header, apologies)
702	False	a	This is my throwaway as I have family members who are redditors and dont really want them to know I'm asking for help. If you'd like I can send you a message from my regular account to verify. Just need some dinner tonight so I can get my son some shoes tomorrow. I know I could go to pay less and get him some cheapo's he doesnt want and wont last but I hate disappointing him.
703	False	a	Hey man. This subreddit is awesome! Might as well give it a try. Basically I'm out of money, and the only thing I have to eat for the rest of the months is pasta. Aye, I'll survive, but fuck it's boring.
704	False	a	The electric company turned off my power last night, I payed the bill, with what money I had left, but they said they won't turn it on until monday. I have little food, and what I do have is freezer stuff that I can't cook. I have two long papers to write for class and I'm pretty much running on empty and can't concentrate. What's a girl gotta do to get some pizza =\. This post honestly makes me feel so pathetic, took a lot of courage to finally post it, not a fan of asking for help.  It would really help if someone could send me an egift card or something, then when im back on my feet ill payt forward as much as i can.
705	False	a	This stinks... I'm a college student in Normal IL (Illinois State University), but I normally don't have much money for food. I'm living there for the summer because I have a job, but it's part time so almost all of it goes towards rent. Today was a bad day, especially because my friend bailed on driving me over to Sam's Club, and instead offered for wednesday. (my parents let me make grocery purchases up to 50 dollars every 2 weeks). I haven't gone for a month now. All I'm stuck with is frozen vegetables and milk. I'd love to get some decent food for now until wednesday. Pizzerias around here include papa johns, pizza hut and dominos (it's a college town, it has EVERY franchise available).
706	False	a	My kids &amp; my friend's kids are having a sleepover Friday night at my house. I'd love to treat them to a couple of pizzas since it's a rare treat for all of them. I'm unemployed &amp; my friend is on SSI. If anyone would like to help the kids would be thrilled! It's their last sleepover before school starts. 
707	True	a	I'm in Brainerd, MN. Anything is incredibly appreciated. Thanks, Reddit. 
708	False	a	(Bay Area, California) I just lost my job about a month ago. I'm at 0 in savings. A friend told me about this. I just want to eat some dinner. Hope everyones having a great day.
709	False	a	I will pay it forward as soon as I get paid, as this subreddit has helped renew my faith in humanity.  I'm one of those college grads (Master's degree) with a massive amount of debt working in a soul-sucking non-related field, and have not budgeted enough for food this month. I get paid on Friday, but would love a good pizza tonight, and low and behold my funds won't allow for it. So, any help would be so much appreciated. 
710	False	a	I'd rather not bore you with the details of my week and I like to have a policy of not dwelling on things :). So hey, if you're feeling generous let me know!  P.S. If anyone just wants to talk or play some games together feel free to send me a PM!
711	True	a	I would be grateful times infinity for the generosity! ;) I am 25 and back with my parents after a year on campus (off-campus apartment) at KSU (kent state university) in Ohio. I moved home June 1, tapped out financially, lost my apartment. While living in Kent, OH I experienced a break-up of epic proportion... my partner moved out mid-way through the Spring semester and I have not been the same ever since. To be completely honest I have no idea what direction I am headed next as far as continuing my education, making a career choice, and by some miracle digging my way out of this financial grave I have dug myself into. (car is up for repo, cell phone is shut off)... yes, it's that bad. Now i'm here, back at home, not a clue what my future will hold as of right now. (I thought my 20's were supposed to be the 'best' years... lol) They were good, however, up until the point I lost my way. To make matters worse... my parents are struggling to make ends meet. My younger brother also lives here (23) and corrals shopping carts at the local Wal-Mart part-time with an associates degree in IT. My mother is laid off from the Heinz manufacturing facility she works at for the next 2 weeks so money is even tighter. It would be nice to suddenly have pizza and surprise everyone here ;)... where it is ordered from doesn't bother me, I have never been picky.   Thought I would try this out and ask. It would sure brighten my day and the other 3 members of the household as well.  (Can send photos on receipt! :D and of course a [Thanks] post).
712	False	a	My son has been requesting pizza all day and I would love to give it to him, but my husband is at work so I don't have a car to go to walmart to pick up a frozen one with food stamps and we don't have the money to get a pizza delivered.  This is my first time on here and I promise to provide a pizza for someone else on a different day when I can afford it, but for now I am just looking for a pizza.  Thanks
713	False	a	I am completely broke right now and have no food to eat except an old can of corn. The last of the money I had from my last couple shifts had to go into my gas tank so I could actually go to work tomorrow. I would be happy with any kind of pizza whatsoever(I don't really like pineapple but beggars can't be choosers). I am not sure what I can offer in return I can take a picture of myself acting a fool or maybe my cat who has a split paw. If you can find it in your heart to help me I will be forever grateful.
714	False	a	Hi! I just found this amazing place, and thought I'd give a nice funny title to my post (Although I am an ethnic minority).   Anyways.. I've been sitting at my computer for the past 18 hours studying Calculus and Physics, both are tomorrow and I have a 1 hour drive to school to :( If someone can help a student who has nothing now but will have something later, it'd mean the world!
715	False	a	We are two parents and a school age child trying to keep cool on this miserably hot day. A friend told me about this site and said she had luck with it a few weeks ago. If there is a person out there who could help out our little family with a pizza, I would be eternally grateful. We get paid next Tuesday and Thursday and would be glad to pay it back then. Thanks, sure hope this works.
716	False	a	So, basically, I am a college student back from spring break.  I had my entire wallet stolen, so I have no credit or debit cards or any cash on hand to buy food.  Nothing in the fridge either. If anyone could help me out, I would happily pizza it foward when my cards come in the mail. Thanks Reddit!
717	False	a	Would adore a pizza this evening, haven't had any lunch and I do not think I can face plain pasta or rice for the 4th day in a row.  I have exactly enough money for bus fare to work tomorrow and Wednesday and that it, all my spending for the past 2 weeks has been calculated exactly so obviously no frivolous pizza buying! Would love a pizza whilst I pack up my room tonight ready to move back home at the weekend. (End of university)  I've wanted to buy someone on here a pizza for a while and I would love to do so (UK) on Thursday night! 
718	False	a	I got laid off over a year ago and I finally got hired for something that might stick for a while.  Just started today, I won't get paid until the end of next week and I just ran out of ramen.  Also, I like pizza.  If someone helps me out I will definitely pay it forward after I get paid.  Thank you!
719	False	a	I dont have any cash on my credit card, just on my paypal, if anyone on here is willing to order a pizza for me I'll send you however much my order  costs plus $10 through paypal, thanks.
720	False	a	I'm a commercial fisherman by trade. I was injured during this last crab season and am told I won't be able to fish again because of it. I'm pretty bummed and broke. I could sure use a pizza.
721	True	a	My family has it rough this time of the year, this mommy always gets sad cuz my parents passed away. Well to top it off Friday I was laid off not knowing if ill get called back and 2 weeks ago my van died. I wanna put a little holiday cheer into my family even though I'm down n out. My Lil one has an ear infection n upper respitory infection n I'm just drained. Pizza would.cheer.us up n help this mommy too. I do have Er papers and a title to a beater car that drained our funds for proof. And if my job calls me to come back ill buy pizza for sum one in need maybe even a few with my first pay check. We r in wi and have pizza hutt and little ceasers near us. 
722	False	a	All I have to eat is this chocolate my mom left me, our fridge is empty except for a door full of condiments(including hot sauce which would go terrifically on a pizza). I don't have any excuses why I am deserving of this pizza, but I desire it with all of my being!  
723	False	a	Out of work right now. Looking for a new job. Got home last night, ate lasagna, went to bed and woke up puking into my trashcan around 4 hours later. I've spent all day in bed feeling like shit instead of out applying at places. I only have 200 bucks in my account and I have no idea how long that'll have to last me. I'd be willing to repay the favor with my first paycheck.  Because I live in a guest house Dominos is a must. The pizza tracker tells me when to expect delivery and go to the main house, meaning I can wait in bed while it's cooking.
724	False	a	"I really hate to ask to ask because I'm such an independent person, but I got ""laid off"" (Problems with my boss, I won't get into it..) a few weeks ago and I've just been coasting on savings trying to find a new job. I'd be happy to entertain any requests or anything that could bring some happiness to someone's life as compensation for doing the same for me. "
725	False	a	[Long Island, new york] If someone would pull through, that would be amazing. i'm pretty much out of food/money until next wednesday.[ i'm spending the night over at my cousins friday but i have nothing to eat today or tomorrow D: just some easter candy.. lol, there are plenty of people who are in worse shape than i am but i thought i would give this a shot. thanks for reading :D    EDIT: also, i'll give you some cool TF2 stuff over steam, the only thing i have to offer :( i might have a 42 hour live card? I could mail you some xbox games like skyrim and stuff depending on your location :}
726	False	a	Hi, I actually hate asking for this but I'll pay it forward! Got laid off from my job and have ran out of food a week ago. I have been fine tho, but after losing weight my appetite has come back with a vengeance and I still have to wait another week before I get some support money. So have to put a request out there. Thank you (:
727	False	a	found this site through a friends post on fb, got hungry and fascinated *being totaly broke* decided to eat microwaved taquito's untill i burst.  having failed that, was encouraged to post this request in IRC. &lt;3 to all!
728	False	a	We were going to the beach to take pictures for our pen pal in the US and it rained so we are very sad and would love a pizza. So now I am going to watch Game Of Thrones! I can draw alright, so if you give me a cartoon character I will draw them for you!    Thanks for reading :)
729	False	a	Hey,   I'm new to this so I really don't know if I'm doing this right. I live in Atlanta, GA 30305. I just moved out on my own for the first time in July and during the 3rd week of July I lost my job. I have rent coming up next week and my first check from my new job is expected then. But I'm hungry now. I don't have enough food to last me til then. I'm just trying to learn how to survive on my own. So if anyone can help I will appreciate you til the end of time!!! When it comes to pizza i'm not picky especially not at this point.
730	False	a	This is my first time doing this but I could really use a pizza tonight. I am broke till friday and I will be living on spaghetti and ramen until then. Please help me with some delicious pizza. I promise I will pay it forward come pay day friday!!
731	False	a	That's my only request. This sub has turned into a bad episode of Dr. Phil... This is supposed to be fun and random, not acts of sympathy pizza.   I hate to sound heartless, but come on! Everybody has problems and should try and deal with them on their own time. If your dog dies, or you lose your job, I do feel bad for you, but that isn't what this sub is about. You should be with your family and feiends, not trying to figure out deep dish or thin-n-crispy from Pizza Hut...   It has become a pity party, not a pizza party. Let's keep the crying to a minimum...   Downvote if you must, but this is my only request. Let's keep this lighthearted... Sorry for the rant fellow pizza lovers... Keep on pizza-ing on...
732	False	a	I'm currently skint with only pasta in the cupboard fighting through the 5 essays I've got to submit in the next few weeks. Would really appreciate some pizza goodness to help feed the belly as well as the brain.
733	False	a	Hey, I'm a broke college student, would really appreciate a pizza.  I'll pay it forward when I can
734	False	a	Our family has been stuck eating sandwiches, cups of soup and cereal for the past three weeks since our car blew up and left us stranded in a hotel room. I would love to make my kids smile by having pizza delivered to them for dinner tonight. Can anyone help us?? We would greatly apprecaite it!! 
735	False	a	Hi! I don't consider myself particularly destitute, but some delivery, be it pizza or whatever else, would certainly be appreciated tonight. Story and circumstance below.  ---  I work at one of my school's IT help desks. It's our fall break, and I'm here alone from 2p-10p central. Normally, I'd get a lunch break, but as I'm the only one here (no supervisor, or anything), and I don't have a key, I can't leave the office.  Delivery is fine, but I'm running low on cash until payday. A tight spot to be in this week, but I'm usually OK. When I get off, there will be campus food I can get, so it's really a matter of making it til 10pm.  ---  Anything else you'd like to know, please let me know. Thanks for even reading =)  ---  I was helped out by a friend =) Thanks all, and happy pizza 
736	False	a	I know y'all don't wanna sob story, but I am pending unemployment benefits and could really use some grub. Any luck?
737	False	a	My bank account balance is negative and I have a craving for pizza. Humbly requesting some help with dinner.
738	True	a	I was wondering if anyone out there could bless my son with a pizza for dinner tonight. I'm a 27 year old single mom struggling financially right now raising my 7 year old son by myself. Just went through a long drawn out divorce but I wont bore anybody with my personal problems. I'm currently receiving a little bit of food stamps each month but i reallyy have to make them stretch just to get by, which means lots of ramen noodles for dinner. tonight my son is begging and beggingme for a pizza that i just cant afford for him. I was hoping to give this site a shot and see if anyone can make my sons night and bless us with a small pizza for him. thank you so much for listening to my long rambling but he wont stop bugging me about pizza tonight lol, you know how that is :)  I'm in Greensburg,KY and we dont have any pizzaq chains closeby as its a small city but I know we have a pizza hut in town if anyone can help
739	False	a	I'm at my friends house and we just had a craving for a nice pepperoni pizza. It would be awesome for anyone to send me a pizza, but please send one to someone who actually needs it first. But if you do send me a pizza I live in beaverton, OR. Message me for more info! Thanks Pizza givers!
740	False	a	just short on funds until 9/19. Going to pay it forward then!
741	False	a	Pizza is delicious, this is a simple fact.  I would totally order myself a pizza, but that costs money, which unfortunately I don't have.  (I also don't have the best grasp of grammar apparently).  Guelph, Ontario is my location.  Sorry I missed that in the side bar!
742	False	a	I did go out to eat last night to bond with my stepsister and I spent my emergency money and then I gave away my left overs to a beggar. I had such good pasta and bread in there man.
743	True	a	Hi, Reddit.  I'm here because I have a favor to ask.  Tonight is my girlfriend and I's one-year anniversary.  It should be a great night, and sadly I just can't make it happen the way I want it to.  I'm broke and can't afford so much as a few wildflowers, let alone dinner.  I'm not looking for something extravagant, but I was hoping I'd be able to find a generous soul willing to help me surprise her.  She knows I can't afford anything, so I know she'll be surprised.  I even made this throwaway account just so she doesn't see a request if she happens to check my reddit activity.    We're in Minneapolis.  It's a cold night out there and we could really use your help.  Please help me make this an anniversary to remember.  I guarantee that if you can help us out, we'll be talking about the time that reddit helped us celebrate one year together.  
744	True	a	My story can be found here: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/izeow/iama_man_who_has_lived_in_the_woods_in_a_tent/  Wasn't really looking for handouts or whatever when I posted that, still not really - this subreddit popped up in the sidebar.  I used to do a lot of work in SecondLife, and often I would get people to pay me in pizza.  When I was capable, I gifted people in pizza as well.  I like the idea of sharing a meal rather than being paid directly, seems more friendly.  I'll see what I can do to eventually become a pizza gifter here.  Anyway, if you feel like gifting me a pizza, there is a mom and pop pizza shop I can walk to here you could call and order a pizza directly.  They have a deal mon - wed with a medium one topping for $5.99, or large for like $2 more.  A while back, I had a friend order me a pizza directly with them, no problem.  I'm simple pizza wise - like pepperoni with extra sauce.  I've been living mostly off of ramen (cold-cooked as I have no stove) and dollar menu at McDs, so  pizza would actually be nice.  This is a really cool subreddit.  Hopefully I'll be able to repay the kindness sooner rather than later by passing on a pizza to someone else in need.  I live mid-way down the east coast, and will get more specific when I give whoever the details.  I wasn't asked for the card the time before, I'm thinking an out of state order would be fine.  Wow, if someone does this, thanks so much!  If not, still glad I found this subreddit.  Cool concept - great way to get some actual kharma :D
745	True	a	I prefer saucy to cheesy.
746	True	a	I know a hard drive sounds like a luxury but I do online classes and there's no way I would have been able to go two weeks without a new one and rent is due tomorrow. I brought all my cash together and have just enough to pay it and my water bill. I know it sounds kind of snooty, but I can't/won't eat ramen. I grew up poor and it was dbreakfast/lunch/and dinner for 5 days out of the week. It turns my stomach now. I understand that I've been pizza'd before but that was over a year ago and I have paid it forward. I would appreciate any help and will be able to return the favor either to you or a person of your choosing, or just a random hungry person. Thanks :)  EDIT: I have posted and received a pizza but at some point in my Reddit career, I deleted all mention of my ex, therefore, I have received before, but I have paid it forward. I deleted it without thinking I would use this subreddit again.
747	False	a	I wanted to surprise my roommate and girlfriend with some tasty lunch after they get off work tomorrow morning, and what better than some pizza?!
748	False	a	I'm just getting out of a three day gaming comma with the Uncharted Series. The game was so good I couldn't put it down. Now that it's over, I'll be making any repairs that need be done in my life and continuing it. Sad to say, this binge wasn't premeditated and I am low-on-funds. I haven't had a real meal in three days. I not sure how to say this better so: Please buy me some pizza! I'm so damn hungry!
749	False	a	"Family is losing their house due to foreclosure, was living with them and then they kicked me out because they had ""too much to worry about without worrying about you."" Staying with friend in the meantime, but there is no food anywhere in sight. Hungry and could really use a pizza to cry into/over indulge with. "
750	False	a	So im unemployed and currently living with my brother. He went out of town and left me with a little bit of food. but he got delayed and is staying an extra day so i am out of food. I had lunch yesterday but wont have another way to get food until tomorrow night so a pizza or 2 would really help carry me over until he gets back in town. I hope this works. I can even make a drawing of anything for you if you would like.
751	False	a	My family and I would really love to catch a break.  It feels like the last few months have just been nothing but bad news, from my wife losing her job, our family car breaking down and requiring over $3500 to fix it, my job cutting hours and pay, just a whole bunch of negative stuff we're going through.  My two daughters and son are my rock and my world, why I get out of bed in the morning to work a job where I'm underpaid and busting my back day in and day out.  I would love to be able to surprise them with a nice little pizza treat at some point, try to boost their spirits during this rough patch in our lives.  I would love to be on here with a different story, one in which I'm able to give out pizza to those struggling within the community, and hopefully, who knows, I might be able to at some point.  All I know is that I will pay it forward in any way possible when I can.
752	False	a	I feel terrible asking and to be honest if my girlfriend ever knew I was doing this she would kill me but I don't really know where else to turn. I lost my job and everything we have is about to go into rent so that we don't lose our home. If anyone out there can help out please PM me, you have no idea how much one good meal would help out right now.
753	False	a	I would really love some pizza. Actually, any food would be good right about now.
754	True	a	It turns out that spaghetti every night isn't as appetizing as I once thought it was...  Broke, hungry and lookin' for some greasy lovin's.  To cheer up after crazy bitch roommate jacked the T.V.  Will send smiling thank you picture!
755	False	a	AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!  [VA area, serious offers only please]
756	False	a	Hey redditors,   I saw the article on CNN.com about this place, and figured I'd give it a go. I know that as a new redditor I probably won't get anywhere right off, but I figured I'd give it a try as I'm tired (and nearly out of) of ramen.  Management at my work has cut all of the cashiers' hours down to 25hrs a week. As it is, I barely could afford to pay rent and utilities and get decent food before the cuts... and now, I'm living off of however much ramen I can buy with my paycheck and still keep my bank accounts open, which is not good since my car is still (hopefully) waiting for me to pay off its repair bills.  And to top it all off... I'm currently sleeping on an air mattress, as my regular one is infested with Bedbugs, courtesy of my apartment complex.  This year is not being kind to me so far &gt;.&lt;  For proof... an image of my pantry: http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/6219/photo0074e.jpg  To anyone who helps, a big thank you from the bottom of my heart.  --Christopher  *Christopher sets off to discover what Reddit is all about*
757	False	a	Hi guys  I was wondering if anyone fancied giving out a pizza tonight?  I'm currently having a LOTR marathon (on Two Towers right now) and could really do with a nice pizza to go with it.  It's also my cake day! :D
758	False	a	Been in kind of a funk lately. Had to pay too much for books I'll only be using one semester, I can't find another job to save my life, and me and my gf have been in fight mode excessively as of late... Papa John's won't fix my problems but it certainly would be nice right about now.
759	True	a	Hi pizza friends!  My stupid scooter broke down (Honda makes a great motorbike for people who like to walk!) and I lost my job.  My mechanic's ma is very ill and I'm being a good patient doobie while he takes care of business, but time, money, and food are running out.  Could one of you folks help me out out with a meal?  Many many thanks. :D
760	False	a	I haven't eaten in 2 days and have absolutely nothing in my apartment to eat.  I am almost ready to resort to eating Spicy Ranch sauce...
761	True	a	It's a dreary Sunday here, my mom and dad are off from work today however there's absolutely nothing to eat. We're strapped for cash until the next couple of days when they get a portion of their tax returns. I'd like to surprise them with some cheesy goodness that is pizza! If anyone could help with a pie that would be wonderful!
762	False	a	Girlfriend is at home, sick and hungry. She has no cash right now and I don't get paid until tomorrow or I'd order her some cheeze pizza. If anyone is able to help it would be much appreciated! Thank you!
763	False	a	So here's the micro story: lost my job in Florida, moved back up near family in Wisconsin and into a motel, had to changed to an even cheaper motel so now living in Rockford, IL. I'm now away from family, no friends, and yesterday my car broke down. I am a freelance web developer, so thankfully I can do my work as long as I have internet. But finding work is another story.   I have 89 cents to my name until who-knows-when. Unfortunately where I live, there are no places that deliver. Since my car's broken, I'm not sure I could even do pizza. I was thinking, if I could find the cash, I would walk to the nearest gas station and stock up on pasta-type stuff.   So if anyone out there is willing to help, I would be so very much appreciative. If you have questions on anything, feel free to ask. I have verification as well.   Thank you everyone for your consideration.
764	False	a	[Sob story](http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1gob8a/evicted_from_the_house_out_of_hell/)  Our pantry is almost empty and we're kinda wigging out. A cheesy pepperoni would be fantastic (Bonus points for stuffed crust ;D)
765	True	a	Car won't start and I need my car for work to feed my kids. I'm broke with no food in the house until payday. A pizza would be perfect for them until I can make further moves later this week. I will definitely pay the favor back.
766	False	a	Hi, no sob story for ya... thought i would ask for fun! i'm stuck at work until 1am - had my coffee and thought a pizza would be nice.
767	True	a	Simply put, I'm a broke college kid who hasn't eaten since lunch yesterday...and when I say broke I am not exaggerating. I was paid today and had to use the entire check to pay my bills. I'd kill for a pizza, especially since someone walked by me with a fresh one earlier and the aroma has stained my nose.   Details: I'm not a freeloader--I currently work on campus and am in the process of finding another job. It's surprisingly more difficult than expected, as I don't have a car or the money for a bus pass, so I have to stay in walking distance. I just got home from a 12 hour day on campus so this pizza would be the best way to end the day.   Please be my pizza hero!  
768	True	a	I was cut off by my parents a couple months ago because I've been fighting depression and they didn't like my behavior. Since then I've been struggling to finish school while blowing through my savings because of my nasty eating habit till they ran out at the end of the school year and have been living off the generosity of my gf since I picked up 2 jobs and worked 12 hours today but I haven't worked long enough to be paid. We're both broke and hungry and neither of us have eaten today (it's 9:30 here) and I need food so I can work more tomorrow!!! Once I have paychecks coming in I'll pay it forward. Thank you!!
769	False	a	Greetings, my generous redditors! I just got done with working three consecutive 12 hour shifts at Big Box retail store in IT for Tax Free Weekend.   I'm now in my first day off after the ordeal but 'lo by account is not large enough to bring forth to me a delicious pizza to melt away the sorrows of the weekend until Friday! If anyone would like to help in this ordeal please let me know!  Located in Tennessee.
770	False	a	I'm not getting any money until tmrw, I haven't eaten in a couple of days and then I had like ramen it obliterated my digestive tract. I would love some pizza
771	False	a	My mother left for work around 6:30 this morning and will more than likely be home extremely late tonight, being that my cousin is in the hospital &amp; she's gone to see him every day since he's been hospitalized. She left us $20 on the kitchen table, but my sister was called into work &amp; needed cab fair. Now my brother, sister &amp; I have nothing to eat today. We won't die, but help would be greatly appreciated.
772	False	a	Unexpected costs regarding my car have made it very difficult to keep up. If I can avoid borrowing money from anyone until Friday, I should be on track. That being said, I am tired of eating firm tofu or celery and vegan peanut butter. I have gas in the car to get to work, I just need a few nights worth of food (real food) to get through til payday. Once I am back on track, I promise to pay it forward here.  **EDIT: Forgot to mention I am in the Las Vegas area. If there is something you want from here/me let me know I am definitely willing to work something out.**
773	False	a	Hello redditors, I am very hot and in need of a pizza. I have been living off yogurts for the past two days, I need real food.  If I heat up the oven it just makes the house hotter.  I will give any kind of proof, just ask.
774	False	a	Hello there! My family and I have kind of hit on hard times, though things will be looking up next week. And a pizza would really be awesome, considering we've been on a diet of ramen for a couple of days now.   More than willing to pay it forward next week when we get some money coming in. 
775	True	a	I'm really enjoying this reddit.  Currently I am fighting off a virus and would love a pizza today as I haven't been able to keep anything down recently and pizza is all I feel like I can stomach at the moment.  More than willing to pay this forward once my tax return comes in as well as making a big thank you post. :)  ** Thanks odot522 for the pizza!
776	False	a	True, I'm broke at the moment (and therefore unable to buy it myself), but I'm not starving. I just want some pizza. And does anybody really need a reason to *really* want pizza? :)

We've been in here all day and haven't had a bite to eat yet. Some team pizzas would really boost team morale right about now so we can power through this project and get it done today! :D
779	False	a	I've been going to school at the art institute of wisconsin for about a year now, and since I don't actually live in Milwaukee and I'm kinda awkward, its a little hard to make friends. what better way than to offer them some free pizza and have a nice chat? would be much appreciated.
780	False	a	Just when I thought me and my children were not going to make it I just got a call for a job and start monday. The money I have is a little tight and would love to get some pizza for me and the kids to celebrate our life on the right track. Thank you
781	True	a	Pizza could mean a meal for my sister her family  My sister recently has had a string of bad happenings, Both of our grandmothers just died and her Car broke down on the way to the funerals (~500mi)... Its been very tough and we recently went over her financial standing and she averages -120 a month (more if you include her hospital bill that she dosn't pay)-- but Money aside what she needs most is food especially for her daughter(12) and step daughter(17). Thats what she really cares about..  She recently gained full custody of her daughter, the father sat in jail for the first 9 years of his daughter's life.. then upon regaining his freedom sought to take her away to montana, over 2,000 miles away. An ex-con with a new lawyer girlfriend and a seedy past of child abuse with his other offspring.. luckily she won that- but with that came a nice sized loan for her own lawyer  She's been denied by assistance and by the local food bank- she make JUST over the line for too much  Canned Goods, Cereal, Lunch items for school or anything else  I, her younger sister, am a designer (the starving artist) I gave her what i could of my savings to keep her in her apartment, but now i'm reaching out to the Web- She has pizza hut and papa johns by her home or  I can trade work for pizza/favors  Thank you for your time  -R  TLDR: Sister is desperately behind and needs help, especially with food for her 2 daughters
782	True	a	I'm a college student and I've run out of money, I have very little food for the rest of the semester and I rationing it so it will last (it's mostly oatmeal). I eat just enough to keep me going. I wish i had ramen and Mac n' Cheese, otherwise I wouldn't be asking for pizza.  Thanks for hearing me out reddit.  EDIT: THANKS!! I already got a eGift Card. I will enjoy it.

784	False	a	There's no getting around how few jobs require Kant and Nietzsche. Can I get a little help?
785	False	a	My kids love pizza but unfortunately I haven't been able to afford it lately :-( if anyone would be willing to get us pizza we would be so happy! I'm not sure how this works but we have both a dominos and papa johns close to us! Thanks in advance  Exit: we are located in southern New Jersey also here is a linkto a photo of my children http://imgur.com/qVN1Q.jpg 
786	False	a	I'm in Covington.  If anyone would give the gift of pizza, I'd be most most appreciative.  I'm a broke writer who only had ramen in his house.  Thanks!
787	False	a	I hope I'm doing this right. I waited before posting, because I thought I would have money for food tonight. I tried selling some textbooks on Craigslist, but the person who wanted to buy them never showed up. The money I was going to get from my textbooks was going to be used for food for the week. I am completely out of food and very hungry. One pizza would be enough to get me through tonight, and hopefully I'll be able to get these books sold tomorrow.
788	False	a	My roomate and i woke up to the pleasant surprise of an eviction notice today saying we have five days to leave and we are still broke but we are hungry and haven't eaten all day. someone save us
789	True	a	I'm starting a new job Sunday, don't have any money, and my internet and cellphone will probably be cut off within a week.  I'm going to school so I'll be getting my loan money within the month, but for now I'm cranky and hungry.  I'm an author, so I'll be willing to either pay you back by buying a pizza when my money comes in or including you as a cameo in my next book...  or even writing a short story based around any subject you'd like.  For an example of my writing: [My first published book!](http://www.amazon.com/Spliced-Bloodsoak-Chronicles-ebook/dp/B00795J83O/ref=sr_1_17?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359074784&amp;sr=8-17&amp;keywords=Spliced!)
790	False	a	Random poem for a random pizza and a random day....      * At work so busy all day, No time to eat gotta run can't stay!   * On my way home tummy starts to grumble, as my engine starts to putter and rumble.  * Oh no I need gas I say to myself. Have to reach for the pizza money up on the top shelf.   * Not rich, nor poor. I walked into the house like every man through the front door.   * I sit and look at whats on my desk, load up a bowl and take a deep breath.   * After a hit I see in the corner a fresh new wrapped game.. Maybe a gift for a foreigner!!!!  * I log onto reddit and draw up a post, I decided a contest is what I should host.  * RandomActsOfGaming is where it has been layed. For 36 hours is where it will have stayed.  * Post completed happy with myself, A pizza is what I want I look to my shelf.  * Oh that's right I spent it on gas, and the rest of my money has to last.  * Oh well no worries what can you do, should not have got the extra super jumbo sized corn dog thing while high at the zoo. So random acts of pizza I turn to you  * I am not down on my luck or feeling blue. Others deserve it more then me this is true.   * But if you find it in your heart to warm mine up tonight, I will surely do the same on first paychecks light.  **Edit 1:** I am not selfish oh no I am not, little ceases pizza 5 dollars OH I FORGOT. I have scavenged for changed and less I have found! 5 dollars worth of stuff enough for the crown. So now I leave to go get one my self. With the gas I bought for my pizza money shelf.  Thanks everyone Please skip this RAOP as I have figured out a way to achieve my craving. As that's whats RAOP is all about.... That pizza craving!
791	False	a	I've been applying to all the fast food restaurants (and other places too!) in my area but no offers so far. We have some food for the next couple days until payday but a pizza would help a lot. I can't offer anything besides my word that when I find a job I'll pizza someone too.   thank you! :)
792	True	a	Well I recently was retired from the Marine Corps for medical reasons.  I am having a really difficult time finding work and my bank account is danger low.  That's when I remembered about the awesome people here.  If you can help it would be greatly appreciated!

796	False	a	I'm going in for orthoscopic surgery tomorrow; and just found out earlier today that I have to pay a $100 copay when I get to the office tomorrow morning, this $100 was intended for groceries. I'm only 20 years old, and due to my knee disability, my employer has cut my hours to where I can barely make ends meet anymore. One of the deacons at church suggested this website to me when I called hysterical this evening trying to figure out how I would feed my family for the rest of the week. I have paper work proving my need for surgery tomorrow, if requested. Thank you and God bless.
797	False	a	Ok I am a college student and I live in a dorm but I don't have any money and I have been starving for 2 days already. The only way I'm not on the floor dying of hunger is because I have been drinking a LOT of water. I do have a job but most of that money goes towards paying for the school and the rest for food but I get payed next friday. I would really appreciate it if someone would buy me a pizza and when I do get payed then I will gladly return the favor. 
798	True	a	So we're waiting out for some money so we can get moved, but today my husband got his GED after three years! I'm so proud of him and he doesn't think it's anything special, but I want to reward him. Problem is we're pretty tight for cash after enrolling in college [waiting on loans, yay debt!]. If anyone would be so kind, it would really mean a lot to us.  Also just thanks for having such a nice subreddit for people. It's good to know people are getting help. :D
799	False	a	We're a bit poor at the moment! Two younger brothers and I would LOVE a Pizza. Mum is working late pretty much all the time and we're still not seeing any money from it yet.  We'd just love something tasty to cheer us up so we don't have to eat frozen leftovers!  Thanks to anyone who even read this!
800	True	a	"I've been lactose intolerant my entire life, and I just recently was given ""Lactaid"" pills (by recently, I just got back from the doctor's office) so that I can enjoy cheesy goodness (something I haven't done in 4 years.) Unfortunately, I'm a broke college student blah blah, you know the story. I'd really appreciate a pizza so I can thoroughly enjoy it :)  I live in the GTA area in Ontario, Canada. When I have some money to spare, I'm willing to pay it forward. And reddit, you can hold me to that :)"
801	False	a	So lately I have been having a hard time buying quality food, often times just eating a one bowl of cereal or spagettio's a day. I am getting tired of eating microwaveable/easy foods so I figured I would turn to reddit for some help!  It would be greatly appreciated if someone sent an extra pizza my way, and the best part about pizza is that I could always save more for later!!! Thank you ahead of time for any offers!
802	True	a	It's my birthday and I'm unemployed, out of cash, pretty hungry. One of my online friends sent me a link to this reddit page and said I should give it a try. I'm not expecting anything, but I'd be grateful if someone would help.
803	False	a	I am in the Los Angeles area and in need of some food.  I have no money until Thursday when my SSI check comes in.  Send me a PM and we'll work something out.
804	False	a	Sitting around playing pokemon emerald, thought that a pizza would be really nice right around now. I live in the Utah Valley area, if you are interested
805	True	a	**edit - uninvitedthirteenth gifted me a pizza. She's an awesome person!  Hello,  I don't have much to offer in exchange besides possibly creating a Sim for any Sims 3 players, but I'm stuck inside the apartment with a bad knee for the fireworks/festivities tonight and was wondering if someone might be out here who was looking to spread some cheer for the next year.  Thanks, and I hope your night is warm and in the presence of good company.  edit** In case you're wondering about the Sims 3, I submitted an album to /r/thesims a bit ago with some celebrity sims that I made: http://imgur.com/a/vYhfu
806	True	a	My dad passed away a couple of months ago. Since I'm in full-time school, I wasn't able to go back to work, I knew that the stress of dealing with dad being gone and school AND work would be too much. He was my best-friend, and the only one who helped me when I needed it.   My boyfriend has a job, which he was supposed to start 3 weeks ago, but due to the weather he's not starting until this weekend. We are completely strapped for cash, and our cupboards are bare.  If anyone is willing to help us out, we can pay it forward with his first cheque.  I hate asking for help, but I figure, what the hell, it's just some pizza and I'd love to pay it forward.  -Ally 
807	False	a	economy sucks here and ive been out of work for 2 years after moving over here, could go for a thin n crispy

812	False	a	Hello, RAOP. Nothing particularly wrong is going on in my life at the moment other than I am craving pizza and don't get paid until the 10th. If anybody wanted to help me out, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. 
813	False	a	I just got home from a weekend at my parent's house to find that the my refrigerator stopped working. Everything is spoiled with the exception of unopened cans of pop. I spent all my money while I was out of town and am looking for somethin to eat. Thanks for reading

815	False	a	Any fellow hockey fans out there?
816	False	a	Hi my cousin kellie told me about this website cause she had received a pizza for her and her son when they were in need.. well i'm going to be completely honest on how it all happened.. my friend took me to a party i drank a little much for myself and jumped off a hayloft in a barn into some card board boxes and snapped my fibula and tibia in half and had to have surgery with a medal rod and four screws in my leg. it happened on june 30th and i have been out of work ever since i work and at lions choice they are holding my job for me but i still have a good four months before i can return to work. i understand it was my stupidity that put me in this place and i am completely flat broke since ive been out of work if someone could help that would be awesome :)
817	True	a	Today is my 1 year anniversary to my amazing wife. We live paycheck to paycheck and my paycheck didn't come so I can't even get her dinner. When my paycheck finally comes, I will do the right thing and fulfill 2 requests on this sub-reddit. Cheers to paying it forward!  EDIT:  Thank you Threedice!  We will be sure to mention your kindness when paying it forward in the next few days!
818	False	a	I understand there are other requests, and it's cool if mine doesn't get fulfilled. Just felt I might try to make someone chuckle. You don't even have to send a pizza if you just want to joke around. :)
819	False	a	I snowboarded all day, and made dinner at like 5 cuz i was starving. No more pasta left and don't want to drive to grocery store since i'm drinking. And now i'm really hungry again... If it is in my fate to get a pizza tonight, I will be very happy and grateful, and pizza it forward :] 
820	False	a	I've had a lot happen in the last year but I'm always trying to be positive and keep my head from sinking. I rode my water bill too long this time around. Now just a few days before I could pay them it's been shut off, and they've made it clear they won't cut it back on without payment first. I live mostly off instant noodles and macaroni, now I can't even boil water for a cup of tea. Right now my sink is loaded with dirty dishes that'll probably be ruined by the time I can run the dishwasher. I don't get anymore cash until this weekend, so the water isn't coming back anytime soon. I'm not working at the moment and I don't have wheels anymore either. My bank account is literally drawn down to the 70 cent mark, even if I had transport I couldn't buy anything substantial.   When I asked a neighbor I get along with just to let me fill up a milk jug he told me no instantly. He acted like I was asking him at gun point. So he can borrow my edger, but me asking for a gallon of water is the line, apparently. I don't know what I'm going to do when I inevitably need to flush the toilet. I got a lot of time to come up with creative solutions but food isn't something I can come up with a fix for. I was going to live off spaghetti and macaroni until payday but now I'm stuck with no water to boil them in. I ate an uncooked ramen brick for a meal earlier, if I don't get some real food I think I'll go nuts. I can provide proof if someone needs it, I'll scan the note the left for me or whatever you guys wants. I'm being real here, I'm in a bad way and the end isn't in sight quite yet. Can anyone help me?
821	False	a	The current heat way somehow fried my car and i havent been able to go to work this week. Money is now at a minimum. The nearest restaurants/grocery stores are almost a mile away from my house. i was kinda hoping someone could send me a pizza. I get paid friday and can use that money to fix my car, and then pay the pizza forward. Please help im a long time redditer that wants to remain anonymous. 
822	False	a	Hello fellow Redditors!  Saving up for the $350 co-pay to have my wisdom teeth removed (too close to nerves).  A little light on cash for dinner today/tomorrow.  Anything would be appreciated!
823	False	a	My names Marcus and I live in Georgia. Basically I got uninvited to a dinner party tomorrow and I'm stuck out of luck in the food department until Sunday. I got some tuna but no bread or mayo, 2 cans of chef boyardee, a few hamburger pattys but no buns, and a can of black beans. That's the literal contents of my fridge and pantry, and while it's better than nothing at all like some folks have I'm a little less than thankful this year.  My mom died last year and I'm still paying out of pocket to get everything situated with that. If I have any other family I don't know them so spending the holidays with anyone is out of the question. My girlfriend went up to Tennessee but I couldn't get off work so eating with her family is out of the question. And my best friend of over three years told me flat out today his wife doesn't want me to come because her parents are going to be there. So for the first time in my life I'm completely alone on turkey day and it's depressing the heck out of me.  So yeah, no family or friends or money means no black olives, turkey, gravy, those little marshmallows, etc for me tomorrow. Any way I could score some pizza money today so I can get some wings or something? I'd much rather warm something up tomorrow than eat a can of plain tuna or some lousy canned spaghetti. Thanks for any help or well wishes you might offer.
824	False	a	I got called in on my first weekend off in forever because my coworker is an idiot, and claims I was supposed to be in today. It's fine because I need the money anyway... but I'd really like a pizza when I get home, so I don't need to worry about cooking so late, or getting to bed at a decent hour for classes tomorrow. Plus I just would like some pizza...and I promise to share some with my dog. 
825	False	a	Well, i don't have a life threatening disease, i'm not poor, i'm not anti-social and have friends... I mean, there's nothing that makes me stand out to want a pizza more than others. I just want pizza because it's fucking delicious.   I go to school at Ohio University and i just want pizza. Any acts of Pizzaness will be returned to another redditor.
826	False	a	Hello. i'm an artist out of washington state. i make art on postal stickers, screenprints, paper (hand-drawn), and digital photoshopery.   I'm willing to exchange pizza for art.   20bux worth of dominos pizza gets you: 8 postal stickers 1 screen print or 1 logo(this one may come later) 4 hand drawn pieces (i use crayon and sharpie like a champ).  more than 20 bux in pizza=more art  whether you like the art or not is not up for me. if you like to sample my damn fine works, you may find them at drobotart.com  thanks cool people.
827	False	a	My little man was sick last night and we both got little to no sleep. His fever is finally breaking and his appetite is coming back. I asked him what he wanted to eat and he said either pizza or Pogo's (corn dogs on a stick), neither of which are in my freezer. I am exhausted and if I didn't have to cook it'd be amazing, but I don't have the money to order out. 
828	False	a	Hello /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, how's your international coverage?  I'm home alone in Glasgow on a Friday night with nothing to look forward to for the next two weeks except sitting staring at my final year maths notes, hoping something starts to make sense before my exams kick in. I'm tired, stressed and frustrated, and could do with something to put a smile on my face :)
829	False	a	**edit:** nevermind.

With not a single win...This is no Beggar for pizza, but A challenge We play a are 4th last game tonight at 11:30pm Atlantic time.(10:30 Eastern). If we win our first game tomorrow night someone buys us Dominoes pizza. We have a fairly small team of only about 12 guys. So anybody feeling an underdog victory? The scores will be posted online hopefully not to long after them game.  TL;DR - My hockey team has gone they entire season with no in thus far. We play tonight if we win someone grateful soul gives us a Dominoes gift card...I'm willing to do verification, and I can prove the score when the game is posted on my university website. 
831	False	a	Hey,  I live in Moscow, ID and had a ton of bills this week that ate up all of my funds, I won't have anymore money until around the first, and I am completely out of food...little help please?
832	False	a	Hey all,  It's been nice reading some of the stories on here, Didn't think I would ever contribute one of my own but here goes. Basically long story short I lost my wallet last weekend and had to cancel all my cards,  I'm an international student here a couple of thousand miles from home while not entirely on my own I've been making do with the 20euros I had in my pocket since Friday. I was hoping I might get a new card today it never came and now I'm looking at recycling some empty bottles so I can buy some bread for the evening. If someone fancied the challenge of ordering pizza on a Finnish website I would be forever grateful as I really don't want to go asking friends for some spare dinner on Valentines day. 
833	True	a	Well today sucked. Hardcore. It seemed like everyone was in a super bad mood, and I was the only positive person... Got a lot of hate today. I'm also broke, and not getting paid tell the end of the week, and like I said, its only Monday. Anyone want to cheer me up?
834	False	a	Hey, RAOP! I'm having a rather crappy day. Last night I stayed at my boyfriends apartment, and at 1:15 in the morning, they towed my car because I parked in his assigned parking spot. After driving to the ghetto, arguing with both the towing people and his landlord, I still had to pay $193.30 in towing fees. Now I'm broke, bummed, and I just want to spend the rest of the day watching Bridesmaids and Mean Girls and gorging on some pizza. It be awesome if someone could help me out today, I'll pay it forward one day! Peace out!
835	False	a	I went to the doc. today, and didn't get that great of news.  I'm kind of down, and would love to have a pizza to lift my spirits!  I don't get to eat out, and after a long day i'd love to not have to cook. thanks!
836	True	a	The husband and I don't get paid until Friday, and we don't have anything to cook up for dinner tonight. We would greatly appreciate some pizza. The only place we have out here is Pizza Hut.   Edit: I'm assuming that my request will go unnoticed. That's okay though. It didn't hurt to try.
837	False	a	Sitting on negative 240$ in my bank account.  Have worked sparingly the last 6 months, just enough to pay rent/utilities.  I haven't had my phone for 2 months because I can't afford that, first time I've ever had my phone shutoff since I've had it, 10 years.   Of course I will buy someone else a pizza in the near future as well!  Anything helps!  Thanks guys.

839	False	a	Just down on my luck.  I lost my job and am struggling  to make ends meet. The kids and I would love some pizza. I will also pass it along once I am on my feet. I tried this before but no luck lol  Umm dont know what else to say.  HAPPY 4th of July!  I hope this works this time, but if not I understand there are many in need and I think this board is a great idea and hope it stays around a long time. You ppl are truely nice ppl and I wish you all the best.
840	False	a	Hi there! I don't have enough money to buy any pizza, and I'm really craving a pizza from Pizza Hut. Preferably pepperoni and cheese in the crust, but if you are nice enough to buy a pizza, it's really up to you.  Thanks in advance!
841	True	a	broke college student with -8.00 dollars to my name and between work checks(subway) would greatly appreciate a pizza to offset a 8th day of Peanut butter and jelly! 
842	True	a	No pizza in the wilderness. I'd love one before I left. I'm from CNY. 
843	False	a	Basically, started a new job and my pay is on backlog...so a pizza would be great. Thanks reddit!
844	False	a	Dear Sir,    Please to you very much this fine day, blessed be your Niel Degrass Tyson, I am very sick and in the hospital for many weeks. I need you to send me a pizza immediately this day to cure and pay for my many necissary surgjeris. Please do act now! Please include the full name, the 16 digit credit card information, expiration. Many thanks to you and the midnight pork whales and your god sagan. Thanks you and please hurry
845	False	a	It's been a long day, my husband was up all night sick and my two year old has been sick with the same thing the last week. Just at the end of my rope and could really use a break. Thanks!
846	False	a	Just came back from a festival with 2 zips of the blue dream.  Needless to say, me and three of my friends are pretty fucking high.  Any amount of pizza would probably be the most amazing thing that could happen right now.  I would also like to show these stoners the awesomeness that is Reddit.  Thanks &lt;3
847	True	a	Feeling under the weather so I called out off work today! I hate requesting because I feel like I'm begging so I thought I'd give back!   (I'd offer pizza if today were payday :C)
848	True	a	Like the title says I'm in a tight spot and could really use a warm pizza to lift my spirits and give me a break from KD. As it stands I won't be able to both pay bills and afford groceries when I get paid so this would be a huge boost. I'm a long time redditor and am happy to PM you from my main account to verify this as well as provide any other info you would like.    EDIT: Thanks to the wonderful DEStudent I will be having pizza for supper! Thank you so much!
849	False	a	Just been diagnosed with cancer for the second time at age 20. This is my last weekend of freedom before I have to go into hospital and lose all my hair and shit myself inside out for a week so I'd really appreciate a pizza. Before sending pizza I can provide proof (Even if you look over my profile from Oct 2011 to feb 2012 when I first got chemo) It's very easy to get pizza delivered online in Ireland btw. Thank you
850	False	a	I'm whoring my career in the Army i hopes that someone out there will send me some pizza. I'm finally able to get back on a computer after almost a year of traveling and I'm settling in to my new home at Fort Bliss in Texas. I'm new to this area and I'm hungry. Anyone want to help out a soldier?  edit: thing2thatiam is helping me out. Thanks everyone for supporting us.
851	False	a	Hey, everyone. I've been having a tough time lately. My bank account is pretty low, I can screenshot it if needed. The paycheck from the job I had to leave is late showing up in the mail. I'm a lot more fortunate than some people here, but I'm stuck in this spot right now. I would be so so so thankful if someone from this amazing community could help out. Pizza is great.
852	True	a	My girlfriend was over for a visit here in Germany for the last two weeks (left yesterday) and for some dumb reason spent a bit too much money and now can not afford food for today nor tomorrow untill I can get some cash back.  Would love to get a random pizza sometime this week and I can give back when I get back on my feet money wise
853	False	a	I just graduated and moved into a new place in southern Ontario (think London, St. Mary's and surrounding area).  I'm functionally broke for 4 weeks, and would love a pizza, since they keep well in the fridge and can stretch over a couple days.    I have some games on Steam that I'm able to gift: Half Life 2 Half Life 2: Episode One Kings Bounty: The Legend Puzzle Agent  I've also got some TF2 items (nothing great, I don't really play it) http://i.imgur.com/amW9K.png  If none of that interests you, I can also some man hours if you need a C++, C#, or Java developer for a tiny project.  I hope there's someone out there who would be interested! 
854	True	a	We have a pizza hut, dominos, papa johns, basically all the big chains here. I'm just looking for a quick meal for the lil one and myself. 2 topping, medium would probably be plenty for us. (and garlic butter. mmmm butter.) I don't know if anybody has deals with breadsticks but we could take em or leave em. :-)  I've requested and had it filled once, and pizza'd it forward. I will try to do so again come payday. If not this next one, ONE VERY SOON!   Thanks for reading!!!
855	False	a	Hey guys, sorry to come in my first time with a really, really depressing post. I was actually introduced to this place a month or so ago and was planning on having my first entry be a 3-pizza giveaway once I got my financial aid in, but I could really use the tiniest bit of support right now.  I just got the news that my grandfather had his ventilator removed and normally I think I'd be fine with dealing with this, but I think it's because I'm by myself in my apartment (my friends all have plans) and most of my family is up in Jersey to say goodbye, I'm having a rough time. As I'm said, I'm new, and don't quite know how to verify this, but heck, I'll take some kind comments at the very least. Seems like a very loving subreddit, so I suppose I'm just looking for a support outlet somewhere.  Thanks, guys.  EDIT: Orlando, Florida. Sorry, forgot to put that in the title.
856	False	a	New Zealander here. 30c to my name. Haven't eaten in two days. Will provide proof and something else (including but not limited to):  * Pictures of me enjoying said pizza.  - A hug/spoon if you are within hugging/spooning distance.  - I will draw anything you desire.  - I write radio commercials for an internship, will write one advertising your generous self.  &lt;3
857	False	a	Paul is 70, Stones are (rumored) to stop touring in 2013.  I'll post pics with pizza and b-day candles &amp; will give KB the crust.... I'll even go out to Buddy Holly's grave and take a pic with the box!  KB LOVES the crust.  Help a OLD hippeh chick celebrate.  KB is the rottweiler and she NEVER gets crust anymore....  No check until friday and the s.o.b. that promised me he would call about the job, DID'NT.  New here, REDDIT-ly challenged.  WILL pay it forward! 
858	True	a	Just checking this out, I've been consumed by Reddit recently and am now branching out into the subreddits (does this count as one? lol Im new to all of this).   Not really a sob story but hey Ill tell you whats up in my life right now. I live with my gf of 4 years in a modest apartment in some suburb in between Dallas and Fort Worth. In May I was laid off by Best Buy when they closed the facility I was working in and moved it to Kentucky. I have been on unemployment since and have been finding it a might difficult to find a job that will allow me to pay my current bills better than unemployment can. I've gone to college on and off since graduating high school in 03 (if you had asked me then if id be be a college-dropout on unemployment 8 years later...I would've called you nuts) I suppose this is how life goes.   I'm not sure if this is too long of a post for this and I apologize if it is!  if I don't end up getting pizza, that's all good.. I understand that there may be someone in a more grave situation and by all means I would love for them to get it before I.   EDIT: OH! I'm an artist so I would be willing to draw any random thing for free pizza (dont expect it to be like mind-blowingly amazing but I will definitely try to make it cool!) if interest is shown in that avenue, I can link to my photobucket to show my style and see if there is still an interest. thanks all!
859	False	a	I haven't had any pizza the entire semester, and I have missed it very much. I don't have much left for my last month either, a bit of pasta, and ramen.   Would surely appreciate a pie sometime for some variety. Thanks for reading.
860	False	a	"Her name is Chinadoll and she apparently had an enormous hairball stuck in her intestines.  We had taken her to the emergency vet clinic and they did a bunch of tests on her and all of them were really expensive, and then they told us that she would need surgery (which was $2000).  She is home and getting back to being her usual rambunctious self, but of course she should be lying down and recuperating.  We're all dead tired due to sleepless nights of waiting around at the clinic and worrying about her, of course, and could really go for some pizza.  As for the story behind Chinadoll, she is a huge, fluffy, grey cat.  She is sometimes very sweet and loving but usually cruel, stubborn, and dominating.  She is always far smarter than us, very energetic, and very beautiful.  She has been described as a ""probability cloud of evil"".  As a kitten, she was rescued from being hanged by some young assholes.  My SO and I love our four cats as our children, and the other two people in our house see them as family, too.  If you want to treat us to pizza, there are four people here and we like Cottage Inn.  Other pizza places would be fine, though.  An e-gift card would be the best for this, I think.  Here are some photos of Chinadoll: http://imgur.com/a/AMKC6  Thank you for reading, kind Redditors!  "
861	False	a	Luckily both myself and my bike are still in one piece, scuffed though we might be. Planning on studying for my Marine Bio test tomorrow and watching the new Adventure Time ☮  **I get paid Friday, so of course any good karma will be passed on that night&lt;3**
862	False	a	"So here's my story of why I'm here and why I'm so hungry.  7 Weeks ago my dad said his friend was moving in because she needed a place to stay. She arrived the next day and moved into the downstairs guest bedroom with her baby daughter. Four days later her 12 year old daughter moved in upstairs next to me. My dad never cooks and this is fine because I'll cook for myself and enjoy cooking. But I've noticed the food disappearing more and more, when I asked my father to go shopping he did about 2 weeks later and to my surprise 2 more people moved in. Friends of my dads from Tennessee. They were only here for a week but when they left there was no food again. When I asked my dad if I could go shopping with him he said he didn't have the money to feed all these people and asked the women with the 2 daughters to find a place. It feels like it's been forever and they are still here. There's almost nothing I can make to eat besides ramen and corn. The only thing she buys is junk food but not even anything you would want to eat as a snack. Ice creme, ice creme cake, microwave dinners which I can't eat because it's for her ""diet"", and baby food.  What I've been doing is just going out and eating but I quit my last job and began to work with my father. It was hard work and good pay but we live in Florida and it's rain so much the past few days we haven't been able to work and he hasn't giving me a paycheck. Like I said there is corn, ramen, and ice creme I CAN eat. I really rather not but if you are generous enough to give someone a pizza, try and find someone in more need than I am. If you can't and decide to help me out I will LOVE YOU!  Thanks for reading and I'll answer any questions.  TL;DR: Guest who've been staying at my house eat everything and leave me nothing. Haven't left after being asked to. I'm terrible at writing.  ::EDIT:: NVM! My mother invited me over to dinner and to pick me up as well. (parents are divorced) A concerned friend also invited me out to dinner and asked if I needed cat food. I have four cats but I assured the friend they are fine and they truly are. I have 2 full bags of cat food. :) Thanks to anyone who read and I'm delighted that I will eat tonight!!!"
863	False	a	I had heard it was coming down the pike, but my work cut my hours back because of the Affordable Care Act. I'm working 23 hours, part time per week. I get paid at the end of the week but I have some things I have to take care of, so I'll be hungry til next paycheck. Any help at all would get me through 3 or 4 days if I space it out.   I literally haven't had a scrap of food since Sunday night. Also, I live just down the street from a Pizza Hut, so I can pick it up to avoid a delivery charge.  **EDIT** Begging
864	True	a	Not picky at all; anything is greatly appreciated.   Edit:Doesn't look like its gonna happen but thanks anyway
865	False	a	A friend told me that this subreddit exists. That alone has made my evening. I don't really know how this works, but I figured it cannot hurt to post a request.  I don't have much to offer in return, aside from my gratitude and the promise that when I have cash on hand I'll pay it forward. I just recently moved back in with my Dad and step-mom after life took a bit of a turn, and being able to show up with dinner would be great for both them and me.
866	False	a	I hate asking for help from people but we really don't have a choice right now. I made a throwaway account since everyone living with me is a redditor and I'd like to surprise them. I'm in Minnesota,north of Minneapolis.  Edit-Completely out of food now. Me and the other guy let the 3 girls eat the rest of the ramen. We didn't get food sadly. So we're out of food and no one gets payed until Tuesday. Edit-Seems like no one can a help me out which sucks but there's nothing I can do about it. Congrats to everyone that asked and received today, you're lucky=) 
867	True	a	I had to pay to get my car repaired this week, leaving me with little money until next Friday when I get paid again. Some pizza would be really amazing. I would definitely pay it forward when I get paid next week.
868	False	a	I'm having a one of those bad days. Spent all my money on rent and just had chicken broth for breakfast. A pizza would surely lift a down mans spirit. In return I'll hook you up with a discount at any Marriott!
869	False	a	I get paid once a month and I've just had a lot of unexpected surprises come forward. I'm in Austin, TX and just looking for something tonight. As stated, in exchange I will buy a pizza + extra appetizers or what have you next week as a token of thanks. I'd greatly appreciate it. I even tried rounding up pesos for pizza patron but mine are all Chilean :(  I'll answer any other questions or offer proof if you need.  
870	False	a	This is a throwaway, I'm not ready for my friends who know me on reddit to know what happened. If someone wants to know my real username before buying, I'd gladly tell them.   So I'm honestly just having an incredibly shitty day, and a kind gesture from a stranger would really help me feel better. I'd really appreciate it.  Thank you!
871	True	a	I've got about a dollar in my pocket and i haven't eaten today, but I'm getting money soon. So, I just need a meal to get by for tonight. Help would be truly appreciated.  Edit: I have a verification code too.
872	True	a	Struggling with classes while on academic probation and being faced with a crazy rent hike where the other option is having to devote time to looking for a new place. I have around $6 to my name right now with no idea when I'll get more... could use a pizza to cheer up a bit. Not sure whether anyone will see this, but thanks in advance :)
873	False	a	Well my son has a bad cold and has been up the last few nights ALL night long. Needless to say we aren't getting much sleep! A nice hot pizza would be a great pick me up and a great way to get out of cooking for one night! I'm no one special, but i thought I'd give this a try! I'll pay it forward after the first of the month! Thanks for reading!  
874	False	a	My wallet, containing my last paycheck until i start up training at my new job, was stolen on my way to deposit the check. A replacement won't come until Friday (as i am now in a different city), and i am already in the red with the purchase of new semester books and rent.
875	False	a	Her husband is in the Navy and didn't get paid before he had to leave for a 1 month trip and she has no food in her apartment, what-so-ever.  I'd do it myself but I don't get paid until next week.  I'm hoping some kind soul could help her out.
876	False	a	Its really hot around here, I dont have a fan or AC, and ive been sweating it out.  Last night I came to some rough realizations about some personal things, and I just need a day to sit back and take a day to myself.  Itd be really awesome to get some pizza!  Thanks a bunch for your consideration.  Edit;I live in Pasadena - los angeles area
877	False	a	Due to a doctor's visit and meds pick-up for a flare-up of asthma, I find myself housesitting tonight with no food left and no extra fundage whatsoever to go get something.  I'm in Disputanta, Virginia (part of Prince George), would appreciate any help!
878	False	a	I'm a student, and my fridge is empty. I would normally bike to the store and buy groceries for the week, but somehow I misplaced my debit card, and I don't have enough cash to feed myself.  I would really appreciate a pizza until I can get to the bank tomorrow. I get my paycheck early next week, so I can pay it forward then. : )
879	True	a	Just what the title says. Could really use a RAoP. My birthday is a week from today, we could consider it an early birthday gift. I did post once on Sunday night, and didn't get a response. I'm in a new place, and bills are stacked up high. Thanks in advance for anyone who sees this.
880	False	a	If you don't like my poem, don't buy. I prefer the Papa.
881	False	a	I'm stationed at Eglin AFB, Fl. I live in the dorms here by myself and don't really have the money to go out and do stuff. I mostly skype with my girlfriend/ family and study my course work. Help me ease the pain with a pizza! 
882	False	a	Hey everyone, this is my first time asking reddit for a pizza, or anything for that matter. I'm a 2nd year Environmental Science Major at Appalachian state university. I'm asking for a Pizza because I've been living off of Peanutbutter sandwiches for a bit and a cheesy pizza sounds good. I obviously will live without one, just thought I'd give this try because my friends can't buy me a pizza haha.  After reading other posts, I'd prefer someone who is legitimately starving get a pizza instead, I can enjoy my Peanut butter sandwiches a while longer.
883	True	a	My wife and are a just a couple of broke college students (we are both starbucks baristas). We have  couple of starbucks veggie plates to eat, but would love some pizza! (and maybe breadsticks?)  Thanks, you guys are all super heroes :)
884	False	a	Hey  My girlfriend and I have been sick all week( stomach bug)   We would love a pizza as we don't really have the energy to cook right now. Or the funds to order.  It would be really helpful, would order forward or return the favour after pay day.    Thanks for reading  Edit:  No longer needed, my brother turned up with a pizza and a few beers :) thanks anyway guys! 
885	False	a	Exactly what the title says. She had about 20$ that needs to go to gas and we don't have any food for dinner tonight.
886	True	a	I just moved to Indianapolis while I take a semester off of college from Indiana State and I have no food or drink. I was supposed to get money dropped into my account today from a friend that owes me money from work I did for them but they had difficulties with their car. I'm just in a bad spot tonight so if I could get a pizza bro'd to me that would be great. I have a job interview at Marsh soon and I'll make sure to re-forward the kindness as soon as possible. Thanks reddit! EDIT: read the sidebar and got my verification number!
887	False	a	Would you buy me a pizza? There is a dominoes right next door, if you have a coupon code that'd be helpful too! 
888	True	a	I am really hungry, not too broke but i need the rest of my money which is only 23$ to last me until Monday (i get paid) , and i still need to buy gas for work, my fridge is empty. No sob story im just honestly really hungry and would like it if someone could donate me a pizza and i would love to repay the favor to the giver or someone else on the site, idk maybe we can work somethings out. Thank you.
889	False	a	I don't like asking people for things, but we're going through a rough couple of months, since my boyfriend is a software contract worker and had to take some time off before starting work again (tomorrow actually is his first day back at Microsoft! Hooray!) BUT, that means we're completely out of money until I get paid on Tuesday, and we would seriously love some pizza.    I promise to pay it forward on Tuesday and buy someone else in need a pizza. I feel horrible for asking, but we don't really have any other options. We live in the Seattle area, if that helps. Thank you so much in advance.
890	False	a	I don't want to get into my whole sob story, let's just say times have been stressful and tough. Been having a hard time just keeping the utilities on.  I love the fact that food pantries exist, otherwise I'd have to be living off of government food programs, which I'd rather not use since there are much needier people, but after awhile canned foods and dried beans get really old really fast.  It would really make my month to have someone actually pay for a pizza for me. It seems unreal that someone would do this. Here's hoping.
891	True	a	So I made this throwaway because I just feel bad about having to post here, but it's a last resort.  I've been unemployed for a few months and my cash is just winding low.  I'm in the midst of classes that have been taking up my time and preventing me from finding a new job and I'm starting to really stress out about having to pay rent in ~10 days.  I'm not expecting anything, but I figured I'd try for a pizza.  I have a verification code.
892	False	a	I just graduated from university and have little disposable income for eating out. I have been in the mood for pizza for a few days now and heard this was the place to come. Thanks! 
893	False	a	Willing to Offer at anothers request when i can afford to. :)
894	False	a	We just got our first place and are a wee bit low on funds and would love to get some pizza tonight :) 
895	False	a	I will certainly repay the favor when I get paid (:
896	False	a	So sure to a screw up by my company HR department I came home from vacation and realized my vacation pay had been mis applied and I will not be getting it on this check but the next. That was 13 days ago and me and my roommateare broke and hungry. I live in central Texas. 
897	False	a	So, Reddit, want to prove him wrong?
898	False	a	I'm just very poor right now and very hungry, a pizza could get me a few days till payday. I'd be happy to repay the favor on Wednesday!
899	False	a	The title explains it. I live in Indiana would love just a cheese pizza. no way to pick up the pizza so delivery would be appreciated. Thank you. 
900	True	a	If anyone could help me and my girlfriend out it would be amazing and we would pay it forward when we get back on our feet. Both unemployed at the moment in a new city. We have managed to cover rent and bills for the month, but at the expense of nice food and quality of life. ANY type of nice food would go a long way if anyone can help us out and will repay the favour to other worthy redditors ASAP.
901	False	a	I've had a very crappy mother's day, I've been physically ill due to stress, and I'm completely broke. I'd really just like to get some food for my kids tonight.   I've never requested before, I'd really appreciate some help. 
902	True	a	Recently I lost my job, so money has been a bit tight. The other day, my crappy car overheated and blew my gasket. So yesterday I had to put all my money towards a new car, and now I'm too poor for food really. I know this is my first post here, but it's worth a shot haha.
903	False	a	me my mom and sister with 3 dogs and we got nothing to eat. even the dogs are out and we been feeding them our food the past couple of days so they wont go hungry. now we have nothing to eat and nothing to find in the cabinets to make anything. we would love to have something good to eat. 
904	False	a	Obviously i'm having a real bad night. started drinking heavily after i stopped crying  i really dont know what else to say  i dont wanna see anyone or talk to anyone right now
905	True	a	So, I've been having a really terrible week. On Saturday my cat of 12 years passed away(had him since I was 10, really the best cat i've ever met). On Monday I found out that my hours are getting docked, meaning I have to start saving this very moment or I won't be able to afford both food and rent in a month or so.   Here's a picture of Ping- my cat, from a few months ago:  http://i.imgur.com/wbF7K.jpg 
906	False	a	All I have is canned soup and ichiban noodles in the house. about 1 foot of snow fell on Southern Alberta over night, drifting to 3 feet, and I have yet to dig out my car or clear the driveway to go get groceries.
907	False	a	yeah...I'm really craving a good pizza. sadly, i have no money to afford one, and no job to make the money to buy one.. jobs are scarce here, and so is a good slice of delicious thin crust pizza. so RAOP? anyone willing to help me fulfill this serious craving?
908	False	a	I am a deployed soldier in Afghanistan and I am wanting to suprize my wife with a Pizza or something cool. I only have a few problems:  * Wife is visiting kinfolk in Harrisburg, AR which is a town of maybe 2000 with 1-2 mom and pop pizza places that may or may not be open today or tomorrow. one of these is [Checkers Pizza](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?rls=com.microsoft:en-us&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;startIndex=&amp;startPage=1&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=pizza+in+harrisburg,+arkansas&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=pizza&amp;hnear=0x87d437d6283197f9:0xa55b439652fb393a,Harrisburg,+AR&amp;cid=17044012131257561687)  * The only place with Chain Restaurants is 11-15 miles away in Jonesboro, AR and I am pretty sure they do not deliver.   Anyone got any advice as to how I can hook them up. Just trying to find a unique way of telling my wife and kids I love them and miss them.
909	False	a	Thanks in advance if anyone wants to help, I'll pay it forward when I can.
910	False	a	I turn 20 tommorrow and I don't think I'll work this week because I have to code documents (think identifying docs using a program). Well we don't have enough documents to do (DAMN YOU DIGITAL MEDIA!) so our boss tells my and my coworkers to go home and come back when we get a call. Last time that happened, they called us a week later, so we didn't work a whole week.   Anyways, I love Pizza. It's my favorite food. And I live in Houston.   Thanks!   Edit: I'll give back when I have the money to spend on pizza. 
911	False	a	We are just 8 lovely ladies sitting in a small kitchen around an over while our talented friend cuts our hair. We have laughs and love, all we need now is pizza!
912	False	a	My cousin about a week ago tried to change my oil in exchange for letting him use my car to drive to work. Since MN has pretty good Metro Transit, I use that to get to and from class every day.  Cue Friday when I finally had to use my car. Oil light is on. Check the oil. THERE IS NO OIL. He messed up the oil filter and everything leaked out. Had to spend the only money I had left (until tomorrow) fixing it.  Could use a Pizza tonight. My other option is to use the couple bucks i have to buy McDonalds, but then not be able to take metro transit and therefore miss class.   Let me know if you want to help out! I will definitely pay it forward next week. :)
913	False	a	I have a pretty awesome life. Seriously. I have a good husband and great friends, I'm finishing up school...   but this week has been pretty rough and I am craving pizza and already spent my share of the monthly eating-out budget. If someone could get me a small pizza, it would be absolutely amazing.
914	False	a	My pay cheque is being held until tomorrow because I deposited it in an atm last Friday and didn't realize there would be a hold. Stupid move on my part. Anyway would love to eat tonight and now will have 800 coming into my account tomorrow. I got on direct deposit so there won't be a hold. Will try to put an offer up tomorrow regardless of if anyone chooses this or not because I know how much joy a simple act like this would bring.  Thanks RAoP, keep on doing what you're doing, you're making the world a better place.  -woffy
915	False	a	Rent is due, he was late, and we are all broke. A pizza will be great. A reason to shoot him will be Amazing. 
916	True	a	I'm new to this community, turned on by a friend the other day, and I figured I'd give it a shot and see what happens. I was about to post my request, but I feared it would get mixed in with everyone else's and get lost.  My son and I have fallen on some hard times recently. His father passed away about a month ago from a massive heart attack (they call it a widow-maker heart attack, go figure), and we've just been slammed with a bunch of expenses. Jason, my son, is taking it really hard. He's about to turn 15, and his father was his idol.  I would love to surprise him with a pizza some night, maybe get his mind off the whole situation, but I just can't swing it financially at this point, and was wondering if you were still helping out those within the community.  If not, I completely understand, you've provided a huge service to this community already, but I'll keep my fingers crossed.  Thank you so very much
917	False	a	Hey guys, hoping that someone can help me out. I just got my last check of the summer and every dime of it just went to my first month's rent, leaving me with no money and nothing but ramen until I move in next week. Frankly, I don't want ramen anymore, so I'm asking you guys if I could get some help to start my last full weekend of the summer before school starts. I will **definitely** return the favor once I move in and find a job. You can hold me to it! Oh, I live about 30 mins outside of Charlotte, NC.
918	False	a	So my SO and I just had a baby 3 months ago, and have gone through so much in between... Just got a new job and just want some time to celebrate with him and my son... Love to see how generous redditors are, and hope I can return the same kindness :)
919	False	a	Title says it all.  Been reading this subreddit for a little while. Noticed some fun offers. What about fun requests?  I will either do whatever gets the most upvotes. Or if I can't, I will surrender, and let you pass the pizza on to someone else.  **Pizza sponsor CAN be different from the suggesters**  This could be fun.
920	False	a	**Never mind, my friend bought me one because he is wonderful :)**
921	False	a	Very hungry, very poor. Will pay forward next week after being paid. Charleston SC, 29424 300 Meeting Street, apt. 2a. 
922	True	a	"my name is andrew kim im a undergrad student at ucsd (structural engineering major) and ive been out of funds for the past week. i live on camino raposa and earlier this week i was on my way to vons to buy some groceries when a random guy came up to me in his infiniti and asked desperately that he needed gas to go to irvine. first thing i thought was to help him out cause it reminded me of the saying ""today you, tommorow me"". So i decided to lend him money for gas because the person seemed to be dressed properly, had a decent car, and didnt seem to be a scammer to me. he took me to the nearest atm and i thought he would just ask for 40 dollars for a full tank when he said that he would appreciate around 160 dollars which he could pay back this upcoming saturday. i had 100 dollars in my debit card...so i gave him 80. 20 for myself to buy some needed groceries. He then left repeatedly thanking me for my generosity and said that if i called him this saturday he would repay me the amount as well as a gift certificate at a restaurant that he works at. Now it is sunday, i called him around 10 times on saturday and has not picked up. At this point i am guessing that he isnt going to be paying me back and now i have no money for any kind of food and am very hungry atm. i cooked rice and ate it by itself because i didnt have anything to cook but i am still starving. i would appreciate any kind of kindness reddit"
923	True	a	My 5-year-old son and I will be home alone tonight, no Gigi or Papa or Daddy, and we can't afford pizza or any special groceries, so it'd be super awesome if I could surprise him with a nice, warm night inside with games, cartoons, and pizza. It would really make our day! :)
924	False	a	Due to problems with work not paying me correctly or on time, I've fallen in a situation where all of my funds had to go towards my rent. I get a paycheque tomorrow but have zero funds until then, and not gonna lie I'm a little hungry! Heard about this subreddit and thought I'd give asking for internet help a try, and would love to return the favour this week as well! 
925	False	a	Today my boyfriend and I have been together 7 years. It's been a rough, jobless summer, and although we are both back to work, we don't get paid until thursday. We have no money for food, or to celebrate our anniversary. A pizza would make us so happy!  The only place that has online ordering right now only accepts credit cards, so we know it might be a long shot, but hoping someone would be kind enough to help us out. :)
926	False	a	LOCATION: Seattle  (Shoreline)  ((There's a pizza hut very close by))  I started going to school to get my life back on track, but unfortunately my alarm didn't go off a couple times and I lost my job.  Used up my food stamp card and it doesn't refill until the 5th of August.  Only got a couple packets of ramen left.  Normally ramen is fine, but whenever I eat them only I only seem to have a bare minimum of energy, and I have a test tomorrow... I really can't fail this class.  I've ordered pizzas for people and bought people games on Steam before, but no one's ever given me hand.  Got a job interview soon, and every time I get an interview I get the job, so money flow will happen soon and I will pay you back. 
927	True	a	Hey guys, I'm curled up in my dorm studying for finals. It's also freezing cold because my roommate can't fall asleep unless it's freezing. He finished his exams though and gets to sleep in, I'm sure he has a massive hangover.   As any college student, money is tight, and it's hard to actually have a heart warming meal. I usually just rely on hot dogs without buns and ramen.   Of course there are people that are more than me, and please, help them first. I'm not going to die, nor do I have 5 kids, just a college student. Thank you for taking the time to read this and enjoy your weekend!
928	False	a	My wife and daughter went to a funeral. I don't feel like cooking for my son and I. Anyone feel like sending pizza? Only place nearby is Pizza Hut.
929	False	a	I'm not sure how I would get a pizza. :( I live near McConnellsburg, Pa. and we have a few local places, but nobody that delivers. I could go pick it up, but I'm not sure how that would work.  It's the day before payday and I'd really like something other than bean and bacon soup for dinner.  I've given in the past and I'll give again this week if I can get some yummies tonight! :)
930	True	a	First of all sorry for not being an amazing poster on Reddit yet. Still learning the basics of how to post and all the formatting and such.   REQUEST FULFILLED!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!  
931	False	a	We're not going to make up a sob story. We are both are employed full time and going to college full time, and thought it would be fun to give this a try. We would be more than happy to pay-it-forward should this work!
932	False	a	would really like a stuffed crust meat lovers pizza from pizza hut with 2 ranch cups, reason -pregnant and craving one:)
933	False	a	I'm going to be up pretty late tonight, and some pizza would be wonderful in helping me get through the night. Any help is appreciated, thank you.
934	False	a	Just a college student trying to save some bucks.   **Update:**   **Cancelling the Request.** Got too hungry and went ahead and ordered myself a pizza. Maybe next time I won't get so impatient  :) 
935	True	a	Haven't had a real meal for the past 3 days paying off all my bills and having just enough for next month rent.  I'm jobless right now and constantly applying for jobs.  Reason why I moved out here was because I wanted to prove to my parents I could live without their help.  I must say it's been hard but I'm learning a lot about myself here.  For instance, being humble and learning to hustle everyday looking for a job.  I also realized that my parents must have worked their asses off to raise me and my older brother.  It's hard enough taking care of myself.  But yeah, I could definitely use a pizza from domino's and once I get my job, I will never forget this gratuitous act and I am going to offer a pizza on RAOP to another who else is in need.  Thanks for reading!
936	False	a	I've just heard that my girlfriend, her parents and best friend have just experienced a car break in and had a variety of expensive things stolen. They're still waiting for the police (many hours now) and I have not eaten. It would be cool to put smiles on their faces.
937	False	a	Hey guys so my Jetta's engine light came on today and I can't get my car into the shop until tomorrow. My roomie and I meant to go grocery shopping today, but now that I'm carless we don't have a way to get there :( If anyone has a a coupon to a dominoes or any other pizza place we would really appreciate it if someone sent a pizza our way! I would normally just buy the pizza, but I'm going to need all the money I can get to fix this bitch. I feel bad if someone has to buy a pizza, so if someone has a free pizza coupon please send a PM my way and we will forever be in debt to you :)  TL;DR: Two college students in Arizona are starving and without a car. Looking for a free pizza coupon if they exist!  P.S. I can post a picture of my cars engine light at request.
938	False	a	Yup, Yup Yuuuup, Yuuuup, Uh huh, Uh huh. [Phone](http://imgur.com/chd7g) Yuuuup, Uh huh uh huh, PapaJohns? Domino's? Yuuuup, Yup yup yup yup yup yup, Uh huh! Yup, uh huh?  Yup yup yup yup uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, yuuuup. Uh Huh.  Yup,  Yup Uh Huh
939	False	a	"As the title says, I'm currently 17, and living with my Mom that recently kicked Cancer's ass (I am completely unsure what type of Cancer it was/is) but she's having a tough time keeping a job and we barely have any food to eat. I don't really know of a way to prove this for some of the people that may or may not believe me.  Just hoping someone would be kind enough to send a Pizza our way, this was kind of a last resort, to ""ask"" or ""beg"" for food.  Anyways, Thanks for taking the time into reading this."
940	True	a	It's our last week of school and we wanted to celebrate somehow.  I suggested we all pool out money together and throw a pizza party.   So we did and turned it over to our SGR (Student Government Rep) who then had to get approval from the deacon.  But before he could somebody stole the money out of our SGR's room.  And now everybody is pissed and accusing the SGR of stealing our money which I don't think he did and everything is total shit.  I feel bad because it was my idea and because I've been defending the SGR they think I'm in on it too.      I know this is a big unlikely request.  But if someone or a group of someones could make it happen like magic you wouldn't just be feeding a bunch of hungry kids you'd be saving a lot of friendships.  
941	False	a	Wrestling season has its ups and downs. A big down happens to be very little pizza in my life. Since im on break, it would make my day if someone could get me a pizza. Being a student straps me down on cash and i cant pay for one right now. Any response would be much appreciated.
942	False	a	Regardless of the subject, regardless of whether you care to compensate me with delicious pizza, this sort of thing is great to keep my drawing chops up. I prefer Domino's gift cards if you are pleased with my work and wish to feed me.  Edit: [0_0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T2l15bKMZk) Remember, I'll draw for you, even with pizza-y goodness. 
943	False	a	Hey everybody, I've read through a lot of these requests, and there are a lot of people much worse off than I, so if it comes down to it, I hope they get help first. That being said, I would be extremely grateful if someone would be willing to help me out. Like I said, I don't have a sob story, no little children's mouth's to feed, but I'm kind of stuck in a rut in life, and I think pizza might cheer me up. I couldn't tell you the last time I didn't have a meal that wasn't prepared out of a plastic bowl or metal cup. If someone had it in their heart, and wanted to help me out, I would be forever grateful.  Thanks.
944	False	a	My overdraft is dry. I don't have a bank account. Just a crappy pre-pay debit card. I don't have any friends social. I have anxiety. But I went to an social event, today. :) If no one can offer me pizza, how can I borrow a bit of money for an pizza meal deal?
945	False	a	Our two dogs and I've been cleaning our house to keep it nice for her. I've had no time to myself and we ran out of food yesterday. Would seriously love a pizza tonight 
946	False	a	Left my job last month due to anxiety issues and depression. Money has last a bit but the last bit is about to disappear. Partner is also off work due to illness and has been in and out of hospital and doctors offices for months.  Don't have anything in for dinner and just thought I would try and see if it was possible to get a little pizza please.  I haven't used this subreddit before I will be honest. I did give a guy portal 2 back in March though! Haha I don't know.   Hopefully I will get a job and return the pizza favour!  x
947	False	a	Thank you guys! I hope to get pizza! 
948	False	a	In hungry,
949	False	a	As we all well know, borderlands 2 just came out, and the sneaky little bastard ate my money. I'd really appreciate a random act of pizza! I'd happily return the favor in October!
950	False	a	Not going to give a sob story, but it's been a rough year. It is however, looking up.  Just got a raise, but it wont kick in until next check. Just hoping someone could float a pizza, and the favor will be returned. Any more details or anything needed, just let me know. Thanks!
951	False	a	I was depending on my tax refund for food, but it appears that is tied up in a dispute I'm having with DFAS. A large pizza for my boyfriend and I would be appreciated.
952	True	a	I just moved into a new house this week. And need alittle help until I get paid. My bank accounts drained. And I'm so hungry. And so tired of ramen. 
953	True	a	Would be really great to have something other than noodles tonight! A pie would go great this Friday night and some gaming. No sad story here, just college student on a budget!  Thanks all!  Edit: Sorry, Location: Dekalb, IL
954	False	a	I run a business doing smartphone unlocking. I will unlock your phone for pizza. I'm not necessarily broke, I'm just feeling lazy today. I can't do every model, and it's pretty much limited to either AT&amp;T or T-Mobile phones. I can't do every kind of phone, but here is a suggestion of ones I am willing to do with processing time involved: AT&amp;T iPhone (1-24 Hour) AT&amp;T Non-iPhone (1-24 Hour) T-Mobile HTC (Instant [1-60Min]) AT&amp;T HTC (Instant [1-60Min]) Blackberry (Instant [1-60Min]) iPhones are unlocked through iTunes, all others are unlocked with a code. You are required to have a SIM Card from another carrier to complete the unlock. I am just going to give you the unlock code. Also I have to mention, I cannot unlock your phone if it was put into contract on or after January 26, 2013...so please only older phones.
955	False	a	My family has been strapped for cash for a few weeks now and have been kind of scraping for our necessities. Today we don't have enough money for any food today and what we have been eating isn't exactly top tier. Could probably go today but would really appreciate some pizza.
956	False	a	I am retired army and a disabled veteran and I also have a cleaning business. Right now contracts are very low and so my income has dropped. The cost of the business has started eating into my personal funds and until contracts increase I'm living day to day. I have 1 bag of beans left on the shelf and the food pantry is closed for the weekend as a matter of fact it's closed Monday also. I work hard and that won't stop because I enjoy what I do, I'm just stuck and asking for a little help to keep my family fed and I hope to be able to help someone else in the future :) 
957	False	a	Pretty much the title. The family in my household are much older, and also hoarders, and recently my kitchen has become very disgusting due to a fuit fly infestation. Aside from physiologically messing me up, it kind of also makes eating or preparing anything in the kitchen unbearable with a hundred little disgusting flys buzzing around. They have always been hoarders, but the past couple years the living standard has gone down pretty bad in this place..   I plan to spend tomorrow really getting in there and doing some damage(cleaning wise), they even managed to get into and breed in the microwave.   Needless to say, I have been eating out a lot more than usual(McDonalds dollar menu is a godsend) and it's killing my bank, which approximately now has 1 dollar and something cents, or else i'd order myself pizza.  So I  have my verification code and would be tremendously grateful for this act not to mention making sure to return the favor when I have more cash at hand(poor college student, ofcourse) to another unlucky individual.   Thanks for your time.
958	False	a	My wife and I are having our 2nd anniversry and we've been eating Ramon for the last week. A pizza sure would make things aLOT better. 
959	True	a	Hey RAoP....it's a few days before payday and I'm broke. The wife and I recently got married and I've been outfitting the apartment with what we need...she just got a job a few weeks ago and we haven't really splurged on anything.   Would love some pizza. 
960	False	a	http://imgur.com/NnPh876.png  Hey RAOP, we all know how tough of an economy it is. I didn't expect to have to ask strangers for assistance, but even my mother had fallen in hard times. I recently obligated my contract with Army and am having a hard time reintegration. I haven't had a lot of luck and a pizza would really help. I need a haircut too, but I think that might be a different subreddit. I hope to be able to do the same for someone else in the future.   Eternally thankful, .39¢.
961	False	a	I hope I did everything right. My deal is no better or worse than most people here. I live in a decent place with a room mate, both jobless at the moment and going to school. Both on food stamps. I have a 2 1/2 year old daughter that most of my EBT goes to, which is fine. Problem is both of our cards are empty but mine gets refilled in a week. I have exactly one cup of noodles left, half a bag of pork rhines, a full jug of apple juice and possibly 3 sandwiches worth of bread for peanut butter and jelly. Honestly, we don't eat much. If one of you was so kind as to offer even one pizza, it would be very appreciated. I'll take a picture, thank you, anything. Thanks for considering.
962	False	a	My parents alienated me last night and a good friend of mine and his family offered to put me up for a while. They've been eating nothing but rice and beans for days now and even offered to cook some for me last night when I arrived. It'd be amazing if a redditor could make our day with a random act of pizza for the kindness they've shown me. Thank you for reading!
963	True	a	I like to make 8 bit drawings as a hobby, and I figured why not! Here's an example of my work. http://imgur.com/YHSWb
964	False	a	Reddit, you are great.  Hot Pizza sounds really good,  No sobs, just hungry.                                                      ~McNicken 
965	False	a	Is anyone out there kind enough to help me out? I started a new job Monday (in this day and age, I consider this a win) but won't get paid until the 15th. Spent all my graduation money on the deposit for my apartment near work. I am hungry and can show my pathetic empty fridge and equally pathetic bank account with $1.97 in it. Just throwing this out there if anyone has the heart to help a dude out. If so, I promise to help out another in need on the 15th when I receive my paycheck. Thanks for reading anyway.
966	False	a	its not like I havent been trying, I have. mid summer is just the worst time in the world to apply for jobs. well that and after christmas so ive been told. I sent my resume out to different workpaces and have heard back from a few of them, i'd just like to keep my money in case things dont work out and im forced to wait a little while longer.
967	True	a	Last night we cooked carrots and onions with some spices.  It was... ok. There are six of us living together. I am self employed, N is doing a masters degree in Electronic Engineering, J works building renewable energy devices and teaches kids how to do it, K works at a refugee forum, the other K works in a restaurant and J works with children with learning difficulties.  None of us make much money and I don't think anyone has paid their rent today either. If anyone is kind enough to get us a couple of vegetarian (spicy) pizzas in Nottingham, England, that would be most appreciated. Thank you in advance. x
968	False	a	I have no money (aka poor college student) and I just want to enjoy some delicious pizza, so if can get some I would greatly appreciate it :)
969	False	a	Since bank of america is bad at being a bank, they canceled my old debit card without sending me a new one because they may or may not have leaked some information regarding my account. So now here I am left without any means of acquiring food for the next couple days and a pizza pie would be really nice. 
970	True	a	Dad is currently looking for a job and they keep telling him to wait longer before they offer and we're living from unemployment check to unemployment check. Not a lot of food around the house and I don't want him to have to worry about food for at least one day.
971	False	a	My husband got laid off on Wednesday. We have leftovers for tonight but would really appreciate some pizza this weekend. I'm breastfeeding so I need lots of carbs!
972	False	a	I'm staying with a friend's family in Northern Ireland, they've been great hosts, so I'd love to treat them but I'm broke and waiting on two unpaid paycheques.   There are 3 of them + me here, I leave tomorrow.   Grateful for anyone who helps out. My friend is an avid redditor and it'd make his day to receive a RAOP 
973	True	a	So I work at a small, single-owned restaurant, and with the recent heat my hours have been drastically cut. This is my 3rd day off in a row, and my last 2 shifts I was kicked out early because business was slow. Shorter shifts mean less tips. I live on those tips between paydays. My tips have run out, and I made my last ramen noodle last night. I'm searching for a new job because I can't live like this. If this doesn't work, my neighbor will give me some cans and bottles to return so I can buy more ramen noodles. But what would you rather eat, ramen or pizza? 
974	True	a	My friend and I will be studying for finals for many hours this weekend. We are poor, but not destitute. Receiving a pizza for studying would lift our spirits and give us a reason to study very hard and do well on our finals. Any pizza gift card would be met with great excitement!  Thank you for your consideration.
975	False	a	Feeling kinda depressed, had four interviews since then and I got nothing. My daughter and I would enjoy a pizza tonight for dinner.
976	False	a	i know there seem to be a lot of broke hungry college students, but i am another one. no groceries, ive been living off of instant oatmeal and ramen, i dont get a paycheck until next week and 100% of it is going to pay off my credit card. cheese or sausage or pepperoni pizza would be awesome!
977	True	a	I'm just having the greatest of days. My phone's been shut off due to lack of payment, I ran out of gas on the way home from work today, been working for the last 6 days and I still don't get paid until Friday. Looking at the last two bricks of ramen that I have left makes my heart sink. Could anyone make my heart soar again? I would be willing to pay forward a pie after pay day 7/1/11
978	True	a	"Just what it says. If you want me to do a random act for pizza, let me know what it is and how to prove it. Sorry, I don't have a cat. My apartment doesn't allow it. I'm doing this as an experiment and as a treat for my girlfriend. (I will eat the pizza with her.) I live in a major city, if that helps for ideas.  Edit: Okay! Here is http://youtu.be/2wy4UyWBtgY It is still uploading cause I'm an idiot. Enjoy when it is done! Edit2: Sorry reddit, it'll be about 1AM PST before it's done ""processing."" I guess I used a dense format. Edit3: Hooray, it's done!"
979	False	a	I'm sick of eating pizza with tomatoes and green peppers or just a plain cheese pizza. I want meat back in my life... Like Bacon, pepperoni... basically a meat lovers pizza. I miss them so much &lt;/3
980	True	a	So I'm one of those American working poor, my paycheck on friday all went toward rent (which I was behind on, didn't want to be on the streets) and other bills such as power (my state has some of the highest power charges on the west coast, so it's not cheap no matter how much you conserve). Anyway, I had enough left over to buy a few packs of ramen which is ran out pretty fast. I went to my local food bank after work (not above getting help there), however they closed at 3 today (normally they close at 5). I'm going tomorrow after work but am very hungry. Sorry for the long post but if anyone is willing to give I'd be grateful. I'd be willing to provide any proof I can give. Cheers
981	False	a	I would love to eat a pizza, have not eat one in ages.  is there anything i can do to obtain one?   also i am a master in MS paint, and could draw anything you would like!
982	False	a	So straight up I am broke and won't be getting any money any time soon seeing as I have no job and been living in my friends dorm for the past few days and been barely able to get any real food to eat. So I was hoping someone be so kind as to donate a single pizza to a dude in need
983	False	a	Broke college kids would love to surprise my girl with a pizza tonight.
984	False	a	  I am a single mother with 2 daughters. Every since that storm on April 27th we have had a hard time getting back on our feet. I get paid tomorrow. We just need something to eat tonight. 
985	False	a	I don't know much about random acts of pizza, so I'm not sure if it is okay to request pizza on behalf of a random redditor I don't know.  I'm really sorry if I'm doing it wrong, but I saw his comic and remembered you: http://i.imgur.com/DZb4a.png  (Let me know if I shouldn't have this up here, and I'll delete it.) Edit: Oops.  That should be r/atheism in the title. I'm posting before 6 AM and not my sharpest.
986	False	a	I went out friday night for Star Trek trivia (which I lost) and I must have lost my debit card somewhere from the trivia event to my house.  I didn't leave the house at all yesterday as I had no need to since I had enough food to make myself dinner Saturday night when the intention of going grocery shopping today...however My Debit card is gone.  I've searched everywhere and it's gone.  This wouldn't be bad if my bank were open on a sunday but alas it is not.  Since I have nothing to eat today I figured I've give it a shot and ask another redditor for some help .  I can pay you back or pay it forward as early as tomorrow as soon as I can get to a bank and get a new card.  Thanks!
987	False	a	The only thing we have left is a pack of ramen without the flavor packet. Payday isn't for awhile and we're at a major bump in the economic road anyway. Just need something to tide us over till we can get to the food pantry.
988	False	a	Anyone?  Will not return favor
989	False	a	I probably got a total of 2 hours of sleep last night due to my children being sick.  My husband is out of town so I cant sleep today.  I am exhausted and would not have to cook lunch.   Thanks.
990	True	a	I have asked once and I deleted it due to comments that where made. A nice person wrote me and told me this is called trolling and to post again. I need help feeding a family of six tonight. Could anyone possibly help me with a couple of large pizzas and maybe something cold to drink. As god as my witness when i am able to I will return the favor. Either way God Bless and please pray for our family prays move mountains
991	True	a	My family wants a pizza. My husband, My 3 yr old daughter and I are really craving a pizza right now. We don't have the money to get it and we are living on low income. I'm not giving anyone here a sob story. There's no point. It's not going to help my situation anymore or less if people know my whole life story. Like I said, I am just going to be COMPLETELY HONEST. We are all CRAVING A PIZZA :) We have a papa johns around here, We love pepperoni and their little cups of garlic sauce!!  :) Want something in return? A Drawing, Poem, Song, ?!
992	False	a	I live in Monterrey Mexico, yup the city of Narcos, and I would love to see if there are any Regios willing to open their hearts and invite me with a RAOP.  Muchas gracias =)
993	True	a	Long story short, I'm unemployed and joining the army. Unfortunatly it's taking WAY longer than anticipated and in the meantime I have been unable to find any work.   My girlfriend puts up with me and she's currently out now with her little part time retail job which she has to keep us scraping.   I'd like to surprise her for when she comes in from work at 4pm with pizza (we haven't had any for a long time - training fitness etc etc)    Since you got this far - Thanks for listening :)
994	True	a	If anyone has a $5 GC to dominos i could get a small pizza. In return I could put on my best santa voice and pretend to be santa for your kids. HO HO HO!
995	False	a	...I've spent my weekly allowance on other necessities like bed sheets, toilet paper, etc. I had enough money left over to have food the day before yesterday. I didn't mind not eating yesterday since I was asleep due to the exhaustion from moving.   I daren't ask my parents for money because I know money is very tight and being the over loving parents that they are, they'd stop eating for a week if it means I'm comfortable and I just cannot do that to them. If anyone is willing to send me a pizza, then great. If not, then thanks for actually reading all this :)  I'm in Bristol btw  Thanks
996	False	a	I haven't had a job in a about a year and it has put a strain on my relishionship with my long time GF. It also put us i a lot of debt. Along with losing our house. I just got a job that will fix most of the problems, and we wanted to celebrate.   Waxahachie, tx
997	False	a	I'm exhausted. Would love to treat my little ones to a pizza dinner, but am cash poor at the moment. Never asked before, but, did win a contest like a year ago. Would love some pizza hut if anyone is feeling generous. (no one else delivers to me) Will pay it forward in the near future. :) Thanks to all the generous pizza givers here! 
998	True	a	So I am a college kid who's carrying on a long distance relationship with a girl back from where I live in Colorado. She is coming out to visit me this weekend (gets here Friday night) and I'd love to have a nice pizza waiting for her after the 5 1/2 hour drive she has to make. Unfortunately, in order for her to visit she has to stay in a hotel and we're splitting the cost (considering she paid for gas), meaning I do not have the extra money to buy a pizza. Hook a brother up?  EDIT: As a reward, I will send the generous donor a mash-up of Gangnam Style, Party Rock Anthem, Like a G6, Pretty Fly (For a White Guy), and Bad Touch that is no longer available for public download, but very well mixed and great to listen to.
999	False	a	I'm not poor or in dire need, but I would  love to calm my stomach down.   
1000	False	a	Hey reddit,  I'm a recent college grad from Virgina Tech, Go Hokies, with a degree in Accounting.  I'm currently sitting on almost $35000 in debt, and I don't know what to do.  I just checked my account and discovered I have $200 to my name. My rent is $950, all my bills are due and despite having sent out nearly 300 resumes in the past two months, I don't have a line on anything.  I'm not one to beg or look for handouts, but I'm sitting here, constantly refreshing my inbox and Monster.com, hoping and praying for some kind of job offer, and have decided to swallow my pride for at least the afternoon and see if this community's good heart and generosity would give me a helping hand.  I wish I could have come here on different terms, with me giving out free pizzas, but I swear as soon as I'm on my feet, I will return the favor for someone else in need. 
1001	False	a	I get payed again in a little over a week, however I'm playing the ever so dangerous college game of gasorfood. Will return the favor to one lucky redditor when I get payed. We used to do this for guildies in some video games back in the day, I think its rad that something like this exists outside of that world.
1002	True	a	I haven't eaten anything other than rice or ramen noodles for the past week. My roomie is in not much better shape. Both of us are broke as hell and some pizza would really cheer us up.  Edit: location is Bloomington Minnesota a suburb of the twin cities.
1003	False	a	As the title says, I'm a pretty broke college student (at least until my tax return check comes in) and in the middle of finals week studying. A nice pizza would definitely the all-nighter I'm about to pull. I'm willing to provide any info you need via pm. 
1004	False	a	Crazy, but true. I'm stuck in the Houston, Texas area, waiting for money to hit my account again. In the meantime, this old friend, who I now can only pity, played the friendship card to feed his habit, then ran. I would so LOVE a pizza right now. Pizza can make the world right again.   thank you!!!
1005	False	a	just left PA to move to new york to couch surf with a friend until next month when my VA check comes in so i have enough money to get a studio apt with 1st months rent and security deposit due , i have zero funds im a disabled vet and had 3 surgical proceedures done last week , i sure would love a warm pizza but most of all i want to share it with my friend to in some way do something nice for her to repay in some small way the kindness and generosity she gave me       thanks , Louie
1006	False	a	I lost my debit card and the food in my apartment consists of a granola bar. If someone would send me a pizza so i could eat tonight that would be awesome!
1007	False	a	"I guess I posted in the ""wrong"" RAOP...? I don't know...   Either way, just having another rough day, completely broke, somewhat sick (so staving off any doctor visit, no insurance of course), behind on most bills... I'm looking at being caught up within the next two weeks, but today, pizza would soothe my rumbling tummy.   Let me know!"
1008	False	a	Title is pretty much everything. From Michigan and just hungry for a pie. We dig all meats but not too big on greens, ya dig? Glory to whoever can give us something to munch on. Got my grandma and aunt around, so two pies wouldn't be half bad either, but beggars can't be choosers.
1009	False	a	Hi, we're not broke but not living a kings life either, very far from it. we are just feeling a little lethargic today and having a pizza delivered would be amazing, but pay day isn't until friday. We would love to have a pizza and will pay it forward come the weekend when pay has been received. We may have some herb that is inducing such cravings and laziness at the same time as well, so this really would be awesome! Help a friend out ya kno
1010	False	a	Earlier this week, someone managed to get hold of my debit card information and went on a pizza purchasing spree in Malaysia. It will be a few more days before my bank credits the money back into my account and all this stress has made me quite hungry.  Once I get the money back, I will gladly pay it forward!
1011	False	a	I just started a new job but I don't get my first check until Monday (I know...monday?) and it wouls be great to give the kids some pizza for dinner tonight. We are in Indiana, USA, we aren't picky on brand. Thanks. 
1012	False	a	-A weird power struggle at my fathers work ousted him of his position and severance pay.  -We both spent most of our remaining funds on a car we can share because he will no longer have a company car to drive.  -Pizza sounds great right now but we're both too broke for one.   -Any words/thoughts/pizzas greatly appreciated
1013	False	a	I am currently enlisted in the Marines and waiting to go to boot camp soon.  I have no job and very little money (about $25 in my bank account).  I am just looking for something to eat today and I figured I would try for a pizza.    I plan on paying this forward once I'm making money.
1014	False	a	Honestly, it has just been months since I've had a pie. Student loans are keeping my fridge pretty barren. Would really appreciate a piping hot slice right about now!
1015	False	a	I would love some pizza for my little sister and me :)
1016	False	a	So, I deposited my paycheck after my bank's cutoff on Friday and my balance is negative until the check clears on Monday. If someone could shoot me a pizza, I would be happy to shoot a pizza back tomorrow. Consider it a pizza loan? Anyway, I haven't ate since Friday evening and I am absolutely starving. 
1017	False	a	our cat always jumps onto the counter when we eat or cook, and begs for food, i always offer to him, but he never takes it.  but today he decided to lay down on my freshly delivered Hawaiian pizza.  i only got to eat one slice.  help a fellow redditor out?
1018	True	a	I posted yesterday but a very nice lady from work knew I was having some financial trouble and got us food for last night. So I deleted my request. Today we are back in the same boat. Like I stated yesterday, this is out of my comfort zone because I am usually the one trying to help somebody. My husband was laid off about 3 months ago and we usually are able to make it from check to check. I also take care of my Grandmother how is disabled. But this week has been rough. My car broke down on Tuesday. Had to get a new battery and a couple of other small parts to get it back running. This set us back. We are now Broke. We are going to try to have a yard sale tomorrow to get up a little money but have nothing for tonight. I am more than willing to pay this forward when I get paid again next Friday July 15. Thanks for your consideration.
1019	False	a	Mwaahhh thanks. (WA)
1020	False	a	I would like to request someone to send a pizza to my mom. She and my dad divocred (it was final las Friday) she has been having a rough time and could use some encouragement! It would be a blessing to not have to worry about dinner for one night for her, my sister, and brother.   I know alot of people will wonder why don't I do it myself... well I don't have the money for that. My husband and I are currently living paycheck to paycheck like many others, currently only on my income, due to layoffs.  Thanks!  P.S. to all of those out there that are able to give and help those in need and encourage people- you are all blessings from heaven!! It's so great to see that gracious people still exist in the world. 
1021	False	a	i literally have been eating rice with sriracha (nothing else in the fridge) for the past few days, hoping for some pizza to switch it up (and i guess to restore some of my strained faith in humanity? ...i suppose?)   :/   long story short: went back to school and had to work shitty retail gig part time, barely making ends. now outta cash, but just started sweet new job. kind of getting by, barely, due to great friends.   i think this is a nice idea, i'd definitely pay it forward when i get paid. Ask when you need, give when you can...right? Thanks if you can, no worries if you can't :)  (throwaway account btw)  EDIT: Forgot to say in Toronto
1022	False	a	I'm a sophomore female at the university of Illinois. I'm a double major in finance and computer science and have been studying in my office cubicle (because it's quiet here at night and the internet is really freaking fast) for a little over 15 hours now. Anyway, I was just taking a quick reddit break, and thought I'd try. I'm really hungry! 
1023	False	a	I'm a 3rd year illustration student in Swansea, UK and my dissertation (final 8k word essay) is due in just over a week! Have been stressing a lot about it and really don't fancy cooking for my boyfriend and I tonight (we'd only be having tuna sprouty jacket potatoes anyway as its all we've got until march 12th payday!) He also had most of his tool kit stolen yesterday (he's a mechanic) and its really getting him down.  can provide proof of sprouting potato-ownership, proof of half empty tool box, screenshots of half finished dissertation, photos of stressed me/pile of books and screenshots of $20 bank balance!  will pass pizza-love on as soon as I am paid, because we all know pizza runs the universe.
1024	True	a	I'm looking to get some pizza for my day off. I posted to /r/loans first, cause I would like to either pay the person back or pay it forward. I don't get paid until the weekend, so that's when I will be paying it back/forward.   I worked two 12 hour shifts back to back and I'm looking for some pizza to relax with. Thanks in advance if you can help :D  Edit: 1 day later, could still use some pizza. Sure hope I get paid today :s
1025	False	a	I do not have a sad story that I'd wish to share, as I feel that life is full of ups and downs. Because this is one of (if not) the busiest time of the year for retail, I've been working 9 and 10 hour days for about two weeks. I go to school at night and get just enough sleep to wash and repeat. I'm working on obtaining my degree in Business, and I hope that I'll be able to open my own shop someday. I have alot of big ideas I'd like to see play out in the long term business wise, but for now I feel pretty exhausted XD. No real need here, I make enough to get by but after a day of cyber Monday customers I don't have it in me to cook dinner. A ham and pineapple pizza would make my night. I hope someone can help me out, but if not thank you and hope you got in some of the cyber Monday deals.
1026	True	a	I have nothing in particular to barter. I have no huge sob story. Im just a recexnt college's grad that is currently down on his luck. I am from Ft. Collins, CO and am a recent CSU graduate. Things are looking up for me. I passed the certification test to be a Pharmacy Technician so hopefully i can get a job soon. In the mean time, the generosity of a redditor is currently the only way im going to be able to eat today/.tomorrow. Thanks in advance regardless of the outcome of this.
1027	False	a	I'm a single guy in my mid 20's living in California and I lost my job back in May. Two weeks after I lost my job I was diagnosed with Addison's Disease, an autoimmune disorder similar to Type 1 Diabetes but instead of insuline my body no longer produces cortisol as well as a few other hormones.  Most of the money I have left has been going to doctors and pharmacies to keep me healthy and I could really use some help keeping myself fed. I've been lurking on the sight for a while and finally worked up the courage to ask for some help.  If anyone out there could help out I'd return the favor as soon as I could and would be forever thankful.  
1028	False	a	pretty much explained it all up there, gotta spend money to make money i suppose.
1029	False	a	I just finished my last final. I can't leave till tomorrow because that is when our dorm checkout is. I have no money for pizza otherwise I would have bought my own. I would love some cheesy pizza pie to hold me over till I leave.
1030	True	a	I am up against a rock and a hard place tonight in Buena Park CA, we are still without a home and have applied for an apt with the last of our cash on hand from a gig I did (credit/application fee). I thought I had a little more but when I went to order food for my girls I found out I didn't have it. &gt;.&lt; I will pay it all forward when our luck turns!
1031	False	a	I was an asshole. I accidentally made my best friend wait for me for 2 hours outside my house... while i was inside the whole time. Asleep. I BLAME THE TWO ALARM CLOCKS THAT DIDNT GO OFF. It was the first time we were going to see each other in like 6 months, and I was a butthole. She's awesome and decided to come back, so I want to be nice and get her her favorite food- Pizza Hut cheese pizza! But I'm broke. So pleease help me look like less of an asshole? :D
1032	False	a	Got roughly $6,000 on 4 cards over the years from touring in various bands, school, medical stuff, and luxury purchases. Currently living in my friends living room and I have 81 cents in my bank account. I've been applying for work like crazy but nothing has come up for me yet. Looking for a repreave from the now nightly Top Ramen dinner.
1033	False	a	I wake up this morning thinking I would be receiving my normal work emails, but to my surprise this was waiting in my inbox. I know work has slowed down, but I didn't think I would be getting the axe. A pizza would sure bring me up from this low blow. I am not picky, any type would be fine with me. Thank you for reading.  Sorry the link didn't show up. I'll try to repost it. [I hope this shows up](http://imgur.com/RqYGw).
1034	False	a	I'm craving pizza something fierce and only have money in my paypal at the moment. After looking around online, I can't seem to find anywhere that accepts paypal as a payment option.   Anyway, if anyone can give me information to order with paypal or maybe if i could pay someone with paypal to order for me it would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance!
1035	False	a	O sweet reddit bless this hungry young chap with the pizza of my dreams.
1036	True	a	I do not get paid until tuesday and my little brother and I (we live independent from our parents for personal reasons) have been living off ramen and bologna sandwiches. I feel bad for him because he is home alone with no tv or pc :/ i am at my work computer and a coworker told me about this site and thats why i have a new account. I have proof if you need it (including my negative bank account). Please any help would be appreaciated!!

1038	False	a	College student at Savannah College of Art and Design dying for a pizza New to the whole reddit network but looking for a good first experience!  Savannah, ga
1039	False	a	Totally in need of some food! Pizza sounds great. My boyfriend and I are currently getting evicted. No money. Soon we will be going to the shelter, but we have to wait until our eviction is final to get any kind of assistance.  (Edit) I live in Jackson, Michigan! Sorry :( New to all this. My friend told me about this.
1040	False	a	I have been clean for a year and I'm still trying to get my life back together. My mother has been my rock through all of this and I would like to have a nice family dinner tonight. There's no way I could ever repay her for everything she has done for me. I want to thank her for having a hand in my sobriety as well as never giving up on me. If someone could help my family have a nice meal today, I promise to post pictures. Please help make my 1 year clean a real celebration.   We are in Des Moines, Iowa. If you're in the area, you're more than welcomed to join us. Thank you.
1041	False	a	I am a legit redditor with a few jobs and a good set of morals and values. This last couple weeks have been very tough...all the money I made went to pay bills, rent, getting my driver's license back and the  state government took money from my account to repay for past due state taxes. I am very hungry and desperate please help. No family here in the US to help me and I feel bad asking friends for food money. Please help me and I will replay as soon as I get my money right. 
1042	True	a	My younger sister just moved into my apartment with me and we're a little tight on money until school starts (She works at the local university). If anyone feels it in their heart to order us a pizza or two I have a coupon code for Papa Johns that can be used for a one-topping large pizza for $5.99 at the local store. It's carry-out only but I can go pick it up :)
1043	False	a	Sister got called into work unexpectedly and three of her kids got dropped off with me. I wouldn't mind pizza for myself and the two eldest, thirds is only like 6 months old so no pizza for her. More than likely to pay it back or forward after September 9th. Thanks! Oh and I've got a verification code if you want that.
1044	False	a	Located in Ottawa, Canada  Due to some issues with a previous employer my wifes EI was cut really short unexpectantly. Because of this funds have been extreemly tight around the house. This week has been the first week back at school for my son who is in Grade 4. My son suffers from Aspergers and was really nervous about going back to schoo due to diciplin issues in the past. The last 3 days he has tried really hard and after speaking with his teacher today (She mentions hes putting lots of effort in) I would love to reward him with some nice yummy pizza.  Want to say thanks in advance! And I honestly cant wait to be in a better situation to return the favor to the community
1045	False	a	I hurt my hip and can't walk or stand long enough to go to the store/cook. Can't afford to order pizza(only delivery option in my area is Dominoes), and my GP can't fit me in until tomorrow. I feel like an old lady, can't handle the three flights up to our flat, so I'm stuck inside. Need something to pick me up!
1046	False	a	A good friend of mine from middle school passed away and I'm feeling awful. Normally I try to suck it up when it comes to how my scrimping and saving is affecting my groceries but fuck it, tonight I'm just not having it. Not tonight, probably not tomorrow night either.   I just want to gorge myself on pizza. I know these posts are usually ignored but it at least helped to vent a bit. Still, I wish I could have one more hilarious, snarky and thoughtful conversation with my friend over pizza.
1047	False	a	Got bashed last night and had my wallet and phone stolen. Got no money  a broken big toe and a splitting headache. Someone please help a hungry poor man out?
1048	False	a	To whom it may concern,  Hi there, my name's Melissa. I'm a 22 y/o mom/student at Ohio State. Things have been going well in school, but with summer classes the bills have been building up. I haven't had a chance to go to the store and my son has been asking for pizza all week. I hate to deny him but pizza is so cost-ineffective for me it's hard to say yes and not feel a bit guilty afterwards. If anyone would be willing to help out a good cause I'd appreciate it.
1049	False	a	My job Changed payroll systems so I got a shorted check this week. in two weeks I'll be back on track but now I just want a pizza. can anybody  help me out?
1050	True	a	Yep, i'm still unemployed, short on money and would be very happy about receiving a pizza today. It doesn't matter where you live as long as you own a credit card or paypal we can handle this. Thanks guys.
1051	False	a	My wallet was stolen this morning, it had my passport card, debit card, school ID, a couple of prescriptions, and all of my money. My checking account has $5 in it, so I really mean *all* of my money.  I'm really not in the mood to deal with this right now, and I don't know when my next paycheck's coming in the mail. (Should have been mailed on Thursday, but my employer's payroll office is notoriously unreliable)  I'm a college student living near Albany, NY, and would love any kind of assistance.
1052	True	a	 i have $1.80 in my checking account and my school won't allow my roommate to use my meal plan to get food for me. unfortunately, i can't seem to get myself out of bed. i'm starving, and previously mentioned roommate likes to come home high and deplete my supply of ramen.  please help? (:
1053	False	a	Hi everyone,  I have heard of this place and been here before, this is the first time I am posting. As of yesterday I am officially out of food and money. I've been living on Nutri-grain bars for the past month that I had managed to purchase from the store I work at (If they're expired, an employee can purchase them for 75% discount + the normal 10% employee discount, so I jumped on em) however now I am completely out.   I will get paid this Friday, but that paycheck will almost entirely go to bills minus the amount of money I need to feed myself. I'm not going to exaggerated and claim that my situation is dire (it IS Thursday and I only have to hold out until tomorrow) because there probably is someone out there who needs it more than I do. However, if there is a kind stranger out there who has the means and decides to reward me, I would be so much in their debt.  Happy Valentines Day Reddit, and thank you.
1054	False	a	yeah im bummed...idk what to say...i just want a warm dominos pizza to help take my minds of things...
1055	False	a	just kidding, obviously not on the ISS.  But having been unemployed for a bit and using any extra money for bills I am a bit tired of ramen and rice.  It'd just be nice to have some pizza. But at the same time if there is another person who is having a tough time and needing pizza, give it to them.  Because I'll be alright, I have ramen :)
1056	False	a	Sorry I have to be a panzy and hide behind a throwaway. This is just really embarrassing, we've received pizza from random acts of pizza before and the idea of having to turn to it again as a last resort really bothers me..   My husband is doing odd jobs as of right now until he can find a steady job, and I am about to attend college at the beginning of the year. Things have been pretty decent, but we were barely able to pay our rent this month and were only able to buy groceries for which not even lasted up until now as well as a trip to a food pantry. Our pantries and refrigerator is empty and we will not be able to get to the food pantry until tomorrow. It would mean a lot if someone could help us out and get us through the day.   I understand this is a throwaway, so if someone does decide they would like to help, I'd be more then glad to give my account name, take pictures, give you my facebook page, whatever it is you need. 
1057	True	a	Like a big pizza pie, that's amore!  Mmm Pizza Mia?
1058	False	a	I'm having some friends over to my new place for a movie night and I have very little food to feed them with, and even less money to buy food/snacks. I love being a good host but it's been harder lately while I wait for work to pick up. Any help would be great thanks in advance!  I realize this isn't the most dire need of pizza. But it would be a great welcome to this community and I'd love to pay it forward in the future. I also got left in the dark with redditgifts on the last exchange so it'd be nice to have SOMETHING given to me.  EDIT: More begging
1059	False	a	No food, no money, if anyone could be so kind.
1060	False	a	Please help! http://i.imgur.com/k4mZ7kR.png?1
1061	True	a	I thought I had planned a bit better for my family, but I wasn't able to stretch this last check as far. The wife and I have been fighting to pay medical bills with no end in sight. My wife has been in remission from cancer for 3 months. We're both staying hopeful that she have defeated this. I don't know what I would do if I lost my wife. She has been the love of my life for 15 years and we are still going strong. I feel that I've let her down as a man because we have never gone without food. This is probably one of the lowest moments of my life, but I have to ask for help. I asked my brother if he could loan me a little cash until Friday but he's in just as bad of a situation as I am. I found a food pantry but it's too far away and no one at this location was willing to meet me halfway. I am hoping that someone out there can help my family and I. Please consider us. Thank you.
1062	False	a	Thank you for your consideration. :)
1063	True	a	EDIT: TAKEN CARE OF YAY.  Hello lovely Pizza Givers,  I'm a young gal living in Brooklyn, and I just moved from my cozy apartment into a basement room. I'm very sad to have left what was my home, my cat won't come out from under the couch, and moving down four flights of narrow stairs really made my tummy rumble. After paying for a U-haul and a huge load of cleaning supplies, I'm out of disposable income until my next paycheck, but goodness would I love a delicious, cheesy, pipin' hot pizza.   Thanks to all the kind souls who are putting faith in humanity back into the aether.  LOVE, T.  Edit: P.S. I know this is a blankish account. I'm a lurking sort of lady. If you'd like any further verification from me, I can do that. Also, I'll draw anyone a sketch who asks for one, just for shits and giggles.  P.P.S. OHMYGLOB. The amazing pizzamom gifted me a pizza and I am so very pleased. Expect photos shortly.
1064	True	a	My bday is next tuesday and I was hoping one of you guys/girls would buy me a pizza from pizza hut or dominos today being the only places in the area. Im tired of ramen and processed ham. I understand many people have less but today I'd like to eat and be satisfied for the first time in a while. When Im in position to return the favor to random acts of pizza I surely will. Just today I'd like a break. Also, if it interests you I'm entering a program to get my associates degree in welding for two years where I will be living and getting an allowance to learn and pull myself from a negative environment. So contributing back wont take long. Thank you redditers.
1065	False	a	So i woke up this morning to an Email saying that my Netflix account (Which I was under the impression was cancelled) charged to my bank account which only had $0.45 in it at the time.   Tried calling the bank to settle this matter, but according to them since I had them help me with this before (one that happened because THEY charged me monthly maintenance fees that had never happened before) I was not eligible for them to waive my overdraft fee of $30. So now my account is -$40.16. Luckily I convinced them to stop, and my parents were nice enough to cover the fees for now.  tl;dr- my day has been a non stop shit show, and a pizza would bring tears of joy to my eyes. I will supply pics of tears of joy if needed.
1066	False	a	Going to start college soon and I'm chilling with my friends and we could use a pizza. Not to mention we have to hurricane coming here on the east coast so we may be without power tomorrow. If you want to give me some pizza that would be great!  Edit: location Eastern Mass I can be more specific if need be!

1068	False	a	I'm living with my sister, and have been looking for a job. I've been giving guitar lessons so I can pay for whatever food I can buy on my own.  My sister and them barely get by, and there are some days when the kids have nothing to eat.  I've been buying ramen and large packages of mushroom soup and crackers. Mushroom soup has gone from my favourite food, to making me sick.  I live in Canada. Winnipeg, MB.  Got a lovely chicken, onion pizza, and a pepperoni and sausage pizza, with some cheese bread courtesy of **birdnoir**  Best meal I've had in awhile.
1069	True	a	No real sob story here. Just your typical broke-after-paying-rent college student at UNT. Ramen and sandwiches until Thursday seems fairly unappetizing so I was hoping to get a good meal to last through the weekend.  I just discovered this sub and it's awesome. Definitely excited to be able to pay it forward after the money rolls back in...
1070	True	a	I could really use something simple. I just finished a package of instant mashed potatoes and have a pack of top ramen. My sister plans to send money on Tuesday, I just don't think I can continue feeling the way I am until then. I can make a large pizza last me through Monday.   You can guarantee I will pay it forward to someone as needy as myself when I get receive my first paycheck from my new job I started.  A huge thanks, Reddit.
1071	True	a	I don't have a sob story. I just have no money and would like to eat something other than ramen tonight. If someone could find it in their hearts to send some pizza love, I will send internet love back to you.
1072	True	a	I'm just being 100% honest here. I'm not starving, but due to me losing my job and only having enough money to pay bills for 2 months if I don't buy anything, I haven't had pizza in a very long time. I actually moved here from out of state because the job market is better. I am currently living with my parents, at the age of 32. :(
1073	True	a	Hey Guys,  I'm not one to ask for charity. I'm just in a little bit of a pinch. I just recently started a new career and as such I've now been about 3 weeks without a paycheck. With paying my rent and all my bills, I'm now down to about $8 to live off of until my first paycheck comes on friday. As soon as I'm in a better way, I want to pay it forward. So if anyone could be of help, would be incredibly grateful. Thank you!)
1074	True	a	I'm not starving - I'm just hungry, and ramen's no longer cutting it (meat would be great, y'know?).  Direct deposit goes through at midnight, but by then, everything is closed in the area (Pizza Hut, Papa Johns and Donato's). Anyone feel like helping a couple of people out?  
1075	False	a	Basically i have work at 3 woke up with no food and i dont get paid till next week friday and a friend is gonna give me a loan at midnight so ill get some one a pizza back tonight so please can someone help out =(
1076	False	a	I've fallen on some really, really tough times.  Work has been cutting back hours consistently, my wife has had some medical problems we've been working through and trying to pay off some old school debts.  We've been essentially wiped out, and it's getting to the point where I don't know where our next meal is coming from.  The local church has been extremely helpful, but I'd love to be able to give them a break for a night or two, maybe with the generosity of someone on here.  I know it's a lot to ask, and I know there are dozens of people looking for the same thing, but I would be immensely and forever grateful if someone would be willing and able to help us out.   
1077	True	a	Our roommates are all out of town, and a pizza to snack on during our movie night would be great. Thanks guys!  EDIT: We're in Portland, OR.
1078	True	a	Hi there, this is my first request. It's 12:39 local time, and I'm looking at a long night. I have a job that pays monthly, and I receive my first check in about a week. Until then I am completely broke. Thanks!!
1079	False	a	My partner is a wonderful gender-queer pansexual and after six-months I am still enamored. We live in the Barrio of North West Dallas and love-it. While I looked for a tech support job, my partner bit the bullet and took a burger job (albiet, fancy burger place; they refer to it as eco-capitalist.)  We would love a pizza with meat on it (although we are queer activists we do not dabble in granolaheadary.)   What you will get in return: we will personally write you a thank you card and send you a pizza in return. I will make my personal number available to your elderly relatives; so that I can tell them to unplug their router and restart their Windows 98 when their internets aren't firing.
1080	False	a	Recently got laid off from my job. Only have hot dogs in the house and no money coming in for 2 days... Kindness and a pizza would really brighten my day.  Will pay it forward as soon as I can.  EDIT: /u/roxieh tried but being from the UK caused some issues... any US redditors out there with a heart of gold?  UPDATE: would still really appreciate a pizza :)
1081	False	a	My little sister and I got an apartment together in Westminster, CA because all of our family moved to Idaho. Things are going great, except we don't have a refrigerator or any extra money for food. A pizza, or anything at this point, would really do the trick. We are asking for free food on the internet out of desperation. I wish I could give out pizza
1082	True	a	Have recently moved to california and unsuccessful in finding work. as it is I'm in my small flat that turns out is really cold when you cant afford heating and haven't been able to buy anything to eat for 2 days, have been living off local jewish comunity who ocasionally are kind enough to give us some food, would love a pizza. 
1083	False	a	You know that quote from Pulp Fiction about pride? It only hurts, it never helps. I've been learning that lesson this last few months.  Our household's budget is very, very tight. Basically, even though I have a full time job, I can barely make all the payments on a pile of medical debt. (A recent tooth removal pushed us over the edge.)  Well, if there's someone that could help us out, it'd be greatly appreciated. Cheers!  Update: Received a gift card from Gadianton. Thank you. You have done a great thing.
1084	False	a	I'm feeling adventurous. I'm also running low on cash until payday on the 10th. I'm in the spirit of giving, but would like to toss things up a bit- if you buy me a pizza tonight, I'll send you a surprise gift of equal value! 
1085	True	a	Short version of my sob story:  We receive food stamps (husband laid off, both of us also working on our bachelors degrees) which honestly keeps us through the month pretty well.  Food stamp card broke in half and can't find a store to honor it.  We ordered a new card but it won't be here for 7-10 business days. Out of pretty much everything but can visit a food pantry day Monday to make ends meet. Right now things are bleak.   I have a hidden bag a marshmallows in  the back of the cupboard and some wood in the back yard - would love a pizza lunch/dinner and then surprise them with some flaming 'mellows.     EDIT: [Here](http://imgur.com/a/SDvrC#6jszl) are some fresh hot pizza pics. There is a ton leftover for lunch tomorrow too!  Thanks so much to IrritableOwlSyndrome for perking this place up today.  unfortunately it is too rainy for Part B with the fire pit and marshmallows, so I am about to get involved in the longest game of Monopoly in the world.   EDIT2:  This subreddit is fucking awesome and a good example of the good parts of reddit. 
1086	False	a	My house was completely destroyed in the wild fires. Up in Dallas staying with my friend who is currently unemployed if anyone could send a gift code it would be very much appreciated. I don't know when I can repay the favor to RAOP but I will at some point.
1087	False	a	 Just found out my girlfriend is pregnant, and today her tonsil was swollen up like a bloody golf ball. We haven't eaten anything but peanut butter and jelly tacos since Monday (we've been spending it all on doctor's visits.) I will draw you any image of your choosing, and pay it forward or back as soon as I'm paid!
1088	False	a	5 days after christmas my boss texts me to let me know that myself and my girlfriend no longer have jobs.  This has been sort of a shitty start to a new year and a pizza from a stranger would be awesome.
1089	False	a	Sorry about the throw-away account, but my fiance reads Reddit as well.  Currently he's strapped for cash and is just making his rent and bills. He has a job lined up and will start in September. Currently he is living off rice and taco bell sauce packets.   I just want to make his Friday night/weekend just a little bit better.   If you could help at all, it would be much appreciated.  
1090	False	a	http://oi42.tinypic.com/1ht284.jpg Hungry! Thats pretty much it. 
1091	True	a	  I've currently had a series of shitty things happen to me over the course of two weeks, and it's not been looking good atm.  This month has been pretty tough without finaid. I had to come up with rent from frantically borrowing from friends or get evicted from my apartment.  Leaving me with a negative balance in my account as of now and I would really love a hot meal.  
1092	False	a	Just finished up my summer finals! I took very difficult classes but I passed thanks to my lovely roommate. She helped me these past 6 weeks but know I want to thank her!! I don't have expendable money since I am a student so I am asking if someone could help me show her that I am thankful! I will try to return the favor as soon as I get a job!
1093	False	a	im 18 and my birthday is on Thursday 8/25. there wont be a party for me this year.my parents tried to buy me a burger last year but i wouldn't let them but it because we were low on cash.i don't think im making sense anymore.im sorry.Have a wonderful day.
1094	True	a	We don't get our food stamps til Tuesday and are flat broke. Payday is Wednesday and we would be happy to return the favor then!  On Cottman ave.
1095	False	a	Can someone make the first night here a bit easier?
1096	False	a	Well like the title says, just basically looking for an angel, somebody to guide me, a big brother or just simply a break. I'm 18 going into my 2nd year of college and on the top ramen diet. I am broke, I got less a dollar in my bank account. Books have taken the most of $ and I have been applying for jobs but it has not been easy. If you can find it in your heart to simply give someone a break. Please it would be great. I promise to pass it on when I get my loans in.
1097	False	a	My fiance and I just moved to AK to spend time with his grandfather who is doing poorly and return to where he grew up. In doing so we have a grand total of 1.55 cents in change and would love to have something substantial to eat other then the few packs of ramen we have to live off of for a month which is worse then the food rationing we have to do with the pets the poor things. We would love a pizza miracle in our home! Next month when we have money we will pay it forward to another desperate soul &lt;3  http://imgur.com/a/51gOA  Thank you so much for the pizza 1n_my_opinion!!! It's divine and we couldn't wait to dig in!  
1098	False	a	Got paid last week and had to ante up everything for the end of the month billing cycle. Help a redditor enjoy watching some great eSports action? The GSL Finals are tonight / tomorrow morning (05:10 EDT) and I'm going to be up all night. Would love to have chow down on some pizza for the occasion.   Looking to pay it forward as soon as I get paid again, in another 2 weeks. 
1099	False	a	Hi, Reddit. So I'm broke as hell until my first work paycheck comes in and my fridge is pretty bare. I was randoming through subreddits and came across RAOP once again. Are you guys really this awesome?
1100	False	a	hey guys i'm a freelance graphic designer that hasn't been getting enough work lately so money for anything besides bills lately is really scarce ,really would love some pizza for now and would love to pay it forward when a few new jobs come my way
1101	False	a	My girlfriend and I are both recent college graduates, and while my career is in very high demand (and I had no trouble finding a job), she's been struggling these last six months trying to make contacts and get her foot in the door. Unfortunately, education is taking a pounding in this economy and she has her degree in K-12 Art Education, in New Jersey.   In the short amount of time my girlfriend doesn't spend subbing or working at her near minimum-wage job to barely make ends meet, she's cold-calling school districts and putting out resumes left and right. It would be one thing if she wasn't trying, but it pains me to see my girlfriend put in all this effort and have nothing pay off.  I would love to be able to surprise my girlfriend with some new teaching contacts, or some new leads or even some ideas of other jobs that could utilize her degree and background until a position comes up.   I feel awkward writing this, but please, I am NOT looking for money. While I would appreciate the gesture there are more deserving posts here that could use monetary assistance. I just know how powerful and far the reach of Reddit goes, and know that everyone loves to help a guy with a novelty throwaway account! Thanks for any and all help.  
1102	True	a	-I'm located in Virginia. It would be great to have some pizza tonight, feeling under the weather. I don't get paid until the weekend, and this would make our day.
