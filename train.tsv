0	False	a	One of my PT jobs that allows me to keep teaching will involve stuffing hundreds of envelopes with my boss tonight. Pizza would be awesome, would restore my faith in...nah, I have faith in humanity. Just think it would keep our spirits up to have some tasty pizza :)  Will pay it forward (will anyway, whether we get any or not...love this sub :)
1	False	a	Trying to save up money to go to make-up school and its been 6months since I have eaten a pizza. If I keep to my strict saving I will be able to enter my school by January!! Would love to taste the lovely stuff again. If anyone would like to help a Londoner out I would be very grateful. If I make it in the make-up world I will give you a free make over :)   
2	True	a	Help any others that NEED pizza first, but I am hardcore craving a 'za and it would make my week. I will be paying it forward with my paycheck next week as well :D Thanks for your consideration!~
3	True	a	We've been pretty responsible people, my Girlfriend and I.  We've worked hard, spent within our means, and have always been on time with all of our bills and rent.  It seems that last part may have gotten us in a bit of deep water.  After doing the right thing and scraping by, it has come.  My Girlfriend's student loans have kicked in.  This has been a bit of a culture shock to us, and in all honesty, we weren't prepared.    Our total amount of bills almost doubled because of this new one.  My girlfriend has been a bit stressed of late, as have I, because it's increasingly looking like one of us(if not both) is going to have to take on a second job, or the eviction fairy shall be making it's rounds.  We have enough food for maybe one meal, and the nearest payday is next week.  It would be a great stress reliever, and an overall solid evening if me and my girlfriend could share a Pizza tonight.    It would be double the awesome, because her absolute favorite food is pizza, and seems skeptical of this entire community(Reddit all together, not just RAOP). If one of you fine Redditors could show us the way to pizza goodness, not only will you have the good karma, and satisfaction of helping a hard working college grad out, I'll also get my girlfriend to draw you a rad picture!  Win, Win in my book.    I'm located in NW Ohio, and at the moment we only have a Pizza Hut within the miles we have gas to make it too. Thank you in advance, and know, that I am in love with the RAOP community.  This is a true beacon of humanity.  Kudos!   EDIT: Thanks so much to Frankto for hookin' it up!
4	False	a	24, San Francisco. I've been working at my new job for a few months, and it's been up and down for some time. This last paycheck, I had to buy a bunch of furniture for my new apartment, and had scheduled my bills and payments particularly close together, knowing I'd be cutting it close to my next paycheck.  Come tuesday, my debit card was declined for a payment that I knew was coming. I went to check my account and it turns out my gym membership had not been paid, draining my bank account to about 20 dollars.  Adding insult to injury I got sick on thursday, and half of my stuff is at my new apartment.  So here I am sitting alone in a half empty apartment with  no money, sick, broke, and waiting till the 30th to get back on my feet. Any help between now and then would be awesome, and I promise to pay back the ROAP by matching the help given to me.  PM me for details, I have my verification number ready.
5	False	a	It's been my toughest semester yet, having to work overtime just to pay basic bills (all of which I'm still behind on, of course) on top of going to school full time. My last final was yesterday and it would be nice to have some kind of reward!
6	False	a	I'm about to watch American Horror Story with my boyfriend. Would love some pizza. I don't have money because college. 
7	False	a	when we found out our roomate wasnt paying the bills we gave her money for, we asked her to leave, she stole every dime we had. sold stuff and bills are all paid, but its ramen for a cpl weeks. coud really use a reminder there are good helpfull people in the world
8	False	a	This has been the worst week of my life.  Monday, my grandmother died.  Tuesday, I spend all day getting affairs in order to go out of town for a few days. Important to note that, on this day, I lose my driver's license.   Wednesday morning, I'm having trouble finding my passport, and I end up making my ride to the airport late for work.   Thursday goes off without a hitch!! Luckily!   Friday, there's a lot of last minute things to do for the funeral this morning. My mom asks me to take her car to go pick up the dress Nana will wear for the funeral. I decide to grab some food while I'm out. When the girl is handing me my food, I drop the bag. Awesome. Love Friday.   Today, immediately after the funeral. I get dropped off at the airport (5 hours away) and go to check in, only to realize I've missed my flight by 4 hours. I just checked into a hotel near the airport.      I'm just asking for something small. My credit card is under so much stress right now, and I really can't afford to put more money on it without breaking my ability to make a payment this month.    Also, my nephew used my cell phone this morning, and logged me out. I have no idea what my account's password is until I can look on the computer tomorrow morning. I'd be happy to provide some other verification though.
9	True	a	I have to survive somehow until next Friday, when I get paid, until then I have to survive day-to-day and eat anything I can find. On my way home from work, I remembered this sub-reddit, I'll be happy to pay it forward regardless if I get helped or not. This situation has made me realize what how difficult tough situations can be.
10	False	a	We're both poor college students at Purdue, in West Lafayette, IN, and need a break from studying if some beautiful soul is kind enough. I should note that this is my first time using this, and once summer aid comes, I'm going to happily give pizzas in kind. Thanks guys!
11	False	a	I'm in southwestern Michigan, and I've kinda lost all hope in this situation. My buddy and I haven't had anything to eat for a while now and I don't think we can afford to. If anyone could help I would really appreciate it, we ran out of Raman noodles a couple days ago and don't know what to do... Our finances are even screwed for this next month completely, I need some little beacon of light and a pizza would go a long way right now.
12	False	a	the aroma fills the air  as i wait patiently to eat  pepperoni, cheese, and sausage  all are such a delicious treat  
13	False	a	I'm hungry.  Atlanta, GA
14	False	a	So I just found out that I won't be paid at all this month because of some bookkeeper issues. I work in a small neighborhood cooperative and don't make that much to begin with, but this kinda puts me in a dangerous spot with summer electric bills and increasing rent. I know they can't turn off electricity in the summer, so I might go without paying for a few months. A friend turned me on to this subreddit, so I thought I would see if anyone could help out a redditor in New Orleans. I promise to pay it forward as soon as I can :)
15	True	a	Im a student staying at home most of the time with a sick father. Is anyone able to buy us a pizza for tonight? Would really lighten up the mood around here!!!  cheers  edit: someone was already supposed to buy me one today but had problems from Europe and no longer could today. Would appreciate it if anyone could help me out.
16	False	a	Hi all, I am a broke uni student studying for exams. I have a buy one get one free code (so I have lunch and dinner for tomorrow) for domino's as well. I will pay it back when I Get the chance. Thanks!
17	False	a	I haven't slept in 2 weeks. I discovered those 5hr energy type drinks and well... I have a ton of work from work and a ton of free lance work. A pizza would cheer me up and I will gladly pay it forward at the end of the month when I get paid.
18	True	a	Hi guys,  I'm pretty much out of money (and food, been eating fish sticks) until the first of January, when paycheck comes out. I can spot some other hungry people when I get paid, I have no way of proving that, but just take my word for it and hassle me if your so kind to give me some pizza :). Assuming a tornado doesn't blow up my house tonight, it would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks guys! 
19	False	a	Hi /Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, I design doom maps in my spare time[reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette)  and I thought it'd be fun (and yummy!) to make a map or two for pizza. So just leave some details on a map you'd like me to make, I usually map in boom format so pretty much any source port should run it. If you have a midi in mind for me to use post it! (No mp3s please. I think boom might run ogg but I'm not sure). Also I'm a bit of a slaughter mapper, so I might go a biiiiit heavy on the mob count. I don't intend on spending more than a week on the map, so nothing too big.   And just to plug my projects a bit:  [newgothic](http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/?id=16238)  [shai'tan's luck](http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/?id=15945)  I've also done a map for Plutonia Revisited and 2 in the 1994 redux project.  [expect something like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BNYCR3rSMY)   [not like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgmG9dMJNbQ)
20	False	a	Hi guys. I'm home for the weekend with my siblings and tonight I have to babysit them both. It would mean everything to me of I could show them that I'm still fun like I was before I was broke and still living at home with them. Pictures of smiling faces would happily be uploaded as proof :) Thank you so much to anyone that can manage to help out with a surprise pizza
21	False	a	After rent, my portion of the utilities and a few groceries, I have less than a dollar in my checking account. I get paid every other Friday and this is an off week. I did grocery shop, so I won't starve, but there is only so much ramen (with egg and sricha!) that one can take . tonight is my night to hunker down and do all the homework. So if any kind soul wants to spot me for some pizza tonight, that'd be pretty awesome. :) 
22	True	a	Starving writer, here  located in Savannah  just recently moved;  *   Myself and husband  both working but no money  nothing in the fridge.  *  We have much love, still  it's hard to eat out your heart  or something like that.  *  If you pizza me  I will thank you in haiku  customized for you  *  And, when things improve  I will pay it forward, too:  Zen pizza haiku!  
23	True	a	Edit: iEatPie got me.  
24	False	a	Probably a long shot. But I worked a long 10 hour shift and came home to an empty refrigerator. I can pay you back Tuesday. I can give you bank statements and my phone number.
25	False	a	The last few months we've been eating rice noodles in chicken broth at least five times a week for dinner. A pizza would be a very welcome change, and we would very much appreciate it. There's just four of us, so we don't need much.
26	False	a	Howdy all, long time pizza provider here. Some folks at [/r/starcraft](/r/starcraft) put together a king of the hill tournament and stream it every night in different player skill levels.  It gives newer and experienced players a place to have fun and their own 15 minutes of fame. They don't give out prizes really, but winners get a reddit icon. Some users send a T-shirt to people who win more than X games in a row.  Would RAOP be interested in providing a pizza to the winner of a raffle? I want to give everyone who watches and plays a ticket into the raffle and pick a winner for ROAP to offer pizza.  Viewers who tweet @Something will be given one entry. Players who lose are given 2 entries, and winners would be given 3 entries per win.  I'm sorry if I violated any rules of this subreddit. I'm not trying to create some scam, and I don't run the event - it's organically composed - but this is technically still a (statistically) random act of pizza.  **EDIT** DERP they have a  website too http://rcraftgaming.com
27	False	a	:)  What do you want a drawing of?  (I can even mail it to you if you want.)  Or what do you want me to write a poem about?    
28	False	a	No sob story, no special circumstances. Would just like a pizza tonight instead of boring, cold food.   Will give in return when my pay check arrives at the end of the week!
29	False	a	I've been having one heck of a time this month. First I came down with a really bad bug and missed work (Full-time student so I only work a couple nights a week) Then my water pump started leaking on my car. I spent every penny to my name on a replacement and managed to put the car back together without any left over bolts. Then last monday the car decided that I did not need a transmission that works. So I'm stranded on foot waiting for income taxes to come in so I can fix/replace the car.   I'm buried in homework at the moment and sitting here trying to finish a project thats worth half of my grade. A hot pizza would make the night much more enjoyable.   Thanks in advance 
30	False	a	Need some delicious pizza to go with the massive amounts of alcohol I'll definitely be drinking.
31	True	a	hello fellow redditers. i am seeking assistance in the form of food for tonight. Today was rent, and after paying rent, and sending in a check for utilities, I am once again broke. I don't want to bore you with my details, but I am asking for a pizza to help ride out this recession.
32	False	a	Or I will just be forced to eat food at my work, and we only sell popcorn and pretzels. I hardly ever eat anything other than food from my work because I barely ever have extra money and I feel guilty buying food when I can eat that stuff for free. I make ten cents over minimum wage at my job and had to work 72 hours in the past two weeks so I could pay my rent. I just got paid yesterday and all but $27 of my paycheck has to go towards rent tomorrow. I will only have that $27 for the next two weeks. I feel bad asking for charity but I hope someone out there will take pity on me and buy me something delicious. Thank you!
