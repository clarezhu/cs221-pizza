0	True	a	Help a girl out? 1 medium cheese pizza to my work... Thank you and lots of love to whoever has a heart big enough to fulfill these requests.  
1	True	a	Just hoping someone could help me out tonight with some pizza. Money is tight, and food is low. I start a new job next week so i wanted something to celebrate with rather than soup and crackers again. Thanks for your time and consideration.
2	False	a	Third and final interview for a job tomorrow. Southaven, Mississippi
3	False	a	Just moved out right next to Disneyland and I wanted something to eat while I work on unpacking. Heck, might be nice to eat a pizza and watch the fireworks right outside my house!
4	False	a	It's my awesome birthday. Help a brother out plox?
5	False	a	I wanted to get some pizza for my wife and I, we've had a ruff work week and I wanted to get this coming week started right.   Thanks  Verification: OvbIeg5FlQ6A
6	False	a	I would like to celebrate my quarter century of life with some delicious cheesy pizza. [See how cute we are? (fyi, my British family visited, took us out for Mexican.)](http://i.imgur.com/gtysP.jpg)
7	False	a	So I am totally car-less. I wanted to know if this website is for real. Free pizza?:D I'm up for that! I haven't had pizza in ages! I live in a town in the middle of absolutely nothing.  I can't drive anywhere. Help?
8	True	a	Just found out I have about $20 to last me 2 weeks. There is a delay in processing my student loans, so I'm left a little high and dry until that happens. My family has no money (literally unable to give me even a $100) and they're in a different state, so I can't ask them for anything. I'm a little embarrassed to ask, but I've been a redditor for a long time and just stumbled across this amazing subreddit.  This is something I will payback multiple times when I finally get back on my feet. It sucks to be in this position, so I can't wait until I can help someone out, too!  EDIT: CayucosKid totally came through!!! Definitely my hero, I can't thank him enough!
9	False	a	Ugh, so woke up 2 days ago to my 9 year old puking with a fever turned out she ha a UTI. Much fun as last time she had one we ended up in hospital as she was hallucinating through the fever. We've broken through the fever and shes on the mend again now so good to see her smile shes requesting all her favourite foods as shes obviously not eaten properly all weekend and I'd love to supply her with a pizza. 
10	True	a	My 6 year old autistic son, and my 4 year old daughter are finally back in our home after along battle with social services, the problem is that right now we have 5 more days until our food assistance kicks in for the month, and we don't have much of anything to eat. we could really use a helping hand for them, their mom, grandmother, and myself. I feel worse, because I turn 36 in 8 days, and haven't worked in a few years. between the out of work situation, and dealing with both kids disablilities, you can only imagine the stress. My entire family would be so grateful for any help we could get. thanx to anyone willing to help.
11	True	a	I've been living on starvation rations for a week; I was determined to treat myself to pizza for my birthday but the friend who owes me money let me down again...   Any kind-hearted redditors out there wanna give me a present? Much love and virtual hugs will be dispatched via the tubes.  Swindon, UK  EDIT: It is no longer my birthday so I humbly withdraw my request. Thankyou anyway RAoP.
12	True	a	Which sadly doesnt pay the bills or food, but pads out my resume and makes me not look like a slacker. I was made redundant by my previous employer, and despite sending it out to many places, I still have no work...things are looking up but it just takes time...
13	True	a	My bank account is completely empty (http://i.imgur.com/Sl7GO.jpg), and I'm eating my last can of pork and beans right now. Financial aid doesn't come in for another month, and I could really use something delicious for dinner tonight.  I mean, I have other foodstuffs, I'd just rather I didn't have to eat rice pilaf again.
14	False	a	Longer version of the story. I got engaged a few weeks ago and my fianc√© wanted to visit her mother in buffalo. I let her use my car and she wrecked it. I should have got it back by Monday. Now it could be Friday. I never had rental on my insurance because I never used it. Took the rental back Friday to save money since I was supposed to get the car back Monday. So here I am. No cash on me. I used my last bank check Sunday. Lost my debit card. And the bank is several hours walking distance from me. I really want a hot pizza to improve my mood :( luckily I am not superstitious and taking it as a sign that this marriage is a bad idea because we have so much fun together. Enough about me for now. Let's talk pizza! And yes I would love to pay this back forward one I have transportation again! Thanks!
15	True	a	Thank you so much for the pizza Trisha!
16	False	a	I'm brand new to reddit and just found this sub-reddit.How neat and what a good idea. Could someone show us  some pizza love? We rarely get an opportunity to order pizza and the gesture would be really nice.
17	False	a	No monies.. i cant live on super noodles forever need da pizza :O
18	False	a	Pizza craving overload. I will be able to pizza if forward on the Friday after next.. but until then, I'll send you 1 drawing for 3-5 days of whatever you so decide. I'm not an art student, but I would like to offer something awesome for something awesome. 
19	False	a	Title pretty much sums it up, I would like a pizza or two. Would prefer Pizza Hut but Dominos is fine too.
20	False	a	Would love pizza for me and the family on Tuesday so I wouldn't have to heat up the kitchen making dinner! Having trouble with the wiring that runs the window A/C so can't run it during the day, it shuts down the breaker for the room; and while I was able to get out today and stay cool, tomorrow I will have to stay home &amp; cope. Thanks for reading!
21	True	a	In the middle of my final year university exams, got one left next Tuesday... I have no money to eat tonight and just have a pack of supernoodles, you'd be making my week! A pizza would make life seem slightly more bearable and get me to the weekend.   I'd be eternally grateful and you can live with the knowledge you helped a man get his degree. :) 
22	True	a	I am a 22 year old man with a job that doesn't pay extremely well and does not offer insurance.  A full hospital visit is not an option for me financially, so my only options are walk in clinics.  I recently started feeling some severe abdominal pain and ended up going to the clinic two times before it was determined I had a blockage.  I am happy to be feeling much better, but that broke me and I have officially run out of money for food.  I would appreciate a pizza today more than you know.  I would be happy to buy someone in need a pizza this Friday once I get my paycheck.  Thank you 
23	False	a	A pizza would be lovely
24	False	a	Where's my pizza?
25	False	a	I have chronic pain due to osteoarthritis primarily in my left hip and all over my body because of my insurance being useless at letting my doctors actually do anything. This past week has been an extremely high pain week and I'm hoping a pizza will help with my really low morale and depression. Thanks for reading.
26	False	a	We're sitting here chatting and watching the news to distract us from our hunger. Gratitude. What ever you can give is greatly appreciated 
27	False	a	Hey guys as i have said before i do actually work but just been going through some hard times of late. Tonight i find myself with no food willing to get someone a pizza on payday but looking for a nice person to possibly do me a favour tonight   Cheers
28	False	a	First off, long time lurker, just found out about this subreddit and thought maybe someone may be able to help. Over the weekend, I let a good friend of mine borrow my 1998 Ranger. He ended up drinking and driving and drove through a fence (and then on my rims around the block). Totaled it. It was the last thing my dad gave me and I can't afford repairs nor the tow for weeks. By the time I can get it out, it will be costing more than it's worth. I am still going to get it out and fix it, because it is sentimental. All I have to eat is rice for the next three weeks (maybe more); so, I'm not starving, but a pizza would really be a pick-me-up at this point. 
29	False	a	Hi there. I'm at school 100+km away from home and the school just took a tuition payment. Have nothing to eat until Thursday when I get money so a pizza would be greatly appreciated. I could ration it throughout the week. Anything helps if possible, thanks! 
30	False	a	[Charlie Boy](http://imgur.com/ahS6V) here decided not to pay up when finished with one of the local cat prostitutes, so the neighborhood pimp cat had to get involved. He put up a fight but was left with some gnarly battle scars. Maybe with the money I save I could afford to get him a kitty eye patch. To be honest though I've been out of work for a good three months and would love something other than ramen noodles tonight. (Broke college student). Much appreciated!
31	False	a	My roommates, some who are graduating, and I are trying to celebrate this last week but are broke like normal college students.  Save us the beer money and please send us a pizza here at the University of Illinois. It will be much appreciated.
32	False	a	Hello, I had a friend direct me to this when he couldn't help me with any cash. I'm basically awaiting on my financial aid that hasn't came in yet. My bank account has been in the red for 3 weeks now and I've been eating water with Bisquick pancake mix. I'm just trying to get by until middle of next week with my Aid will come in, though I can tell my unhealthy diet hasn't been the best. I don't know how this subreddit works but any pizza would make me so happy. I will gladly return the favor when my aid gets in. My parents or friends can't afford to get my back account black again so it's a shitty situation.  I'm from Grand Forks, ND btw!  
33	False	a	Hello all. We would love a pizza if anyone is able to assist. I'm broke for the next week and the pantry is very low. Normally we don't have any problems but unforeseen events happened. I wouldn't worry to much except I have a two year old. Any help would be great, thanks for taking the time to read this.  
34	True	a	"June 29th I was fired from my job for ""not being a good fit for the company."" (Almost verbatim what I was told. This was after working there nearly a year, and being moved halfway across the country to another office for them, but I digress.)   My unemployment interview isn't until today (within the next two hours) and I can't send in my first form until the 17th. (Willing to provide a picture of the form I got with that info on it as necessary.)   My mother gets paid friday and said she'll be able to help out then (she's back in California, where I was moved from) but until them I'm hungry and all out of food. I've already tapped all my friends and they've been more than generous, so I don't think I can really turn to them.  I did the verification thing on the right, so PM me if you want the code or want me to post it or whatever. **I will pay this forward as soon as I have a job again. Mark my words.**   Please and thanks, all the best.  **EDIT: Received, courtesy of NYGalz. Reddit rules**"
35	True	a	Hello, RAoP. I am currently sitting at my desk at work looking over my checkbook register, sighing at the fact that I have $1.85 left to last me until May 3rd. Yesterday I spent my last little bit of money on a birthday present for my daughter, who turns 4 tomorrow. It has also been raining the last week and a half. Could really go for a tasty pizza when I get off of work just to cheer me up, and will pay it forward hopefully on the 3rd when I get paid again.   Thanks for reading.
36	False	a	I waited for four and a half hours at the ER two days ago for a friend with alcohol poisoning to wake up. Said friend was ungrateful that I brought here there and has thusly ditched me. That being said, the ER gave me some weird chest funk and I can't talk and can barely breathe since I'm coughing so frequently. I also happen to be starving and can't leave my dorm building to get food. I'll pay it forward as soon as I have a voice to order a pizza with.
37	False	a	We are three hungry girls in Brooklyn, jealous of our cats enjoying Friskies Grilled Mix that we spent our last collective $8.49 on. We don't get paid until tomorrow evening! We saw this on a new report a while ago, so we aren't exactly sure how to use it, but it sounds like all you have to do is return the favor! We can do it tomorrow! Can any kind soul help out there?? Attached below is my bank account to prove it! It's been a rough week!  Thanks so much and we love you!  -Chelsea, Elsie, Mel(sea), and the cats  http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/219/mylovelybankaccount.jpg/
38	False	a	Hey everybody. I've been out of real work for a while, and all my part time construction money is going towards bills. I would really like to eat something other than top ramen while I look for a job. I will be eternally grateful and pay it forward the day I can. There will be so much pizza being given out you guys won't even know what to do. Thanks for reading.
39	True	a	My mom's been ill lately and we don't really have any food.. we have rice but that's about it, I get paid in about a week (just got my first job, i'm 18) but something to hold us over until then would be nice :) 
40	False	a	I'm hungry.  Atlanta, GA
41	False	a	i'm broke, i'm hungry. i'm sure you've heard it all before. a pizza would make my night (and hopefully make this headache disappear)! is it too presumptuous to say thank you in advance? :)
42	False	a	Here's the story I have a sick three year old and was up all night. I am tired, my house is a disaster, and I feel lazy. We live on a limited income so can't afford to spend extra on pizza especially with school starting next week and trying to get kids ready with supplies, clothes, fees, and all the crap. I would love a pizza. If anyone has it in their heart to help me out we have Papa Johns, Dominos, Pizza Hut, and Little Ceasers opened yesterday.
43	False	a	I'm a hungry, poor, pre-medical student. Feed me. Please. I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina. I highly appreciate it! Really! (Orange is the New Black+Pizza would really make my busy, busy night.)
44	True	a	I currently have no groceries and no money in my checking, and the credit card is maxed.  I have been working as much as my boss allows while still going to classes and barely affording my rent. I am just looking to feed myself until Monday when my boss gives me my check.   Once I finish this semester and start my internship in the summer, I am sure I can pay this forward!  
45	False	a	I love pizza but i dont have any money. I have it, just cant spend extra on pizza otherwise ill have to live on the streets. money is that tight. You can say it's tight like a virgin. If anyone can help, ill eat.
46	False	a	I heard about this website online and I hope that someone out there can help me. My husband and I haven't had alot of money coming in, he's been driving me all over hell and high water and of course gas is expensive. I'm 7 months in, to his credit, he has been pretty good about my cravings, even getting up at 3 AM to make a taco run (of course he ate more of them than I did). Today I have been craving a cheese pizza with a little barbecue sauce on the side like crazy. With my families budget, we just don't have enough to buy a pizza. And I hate to say it, but I'm in full bitch mode. Not just for me, but for his sake can anyone help us out? I know I've been giving him hell all day. I haven't seen him in a while, I think I scared him off the last time. I know he's in there wrapping pennies, but there's no way there's enough. I'm in Springfield, MA.
47	False	a	I've managed to contract the flu (like the rest of this city). My boss sent me home this morning so no free work lunch for me. Been lurking reddit since I got home. Now I'm hungry.  Never requested RAoP, but it would be greatly appreciated, would also love to pay it forward!
48	True	a	Hi guys, I missed an entire week of work and I have one dollar left, I had a tooth abscess on me and had to have extremely painful surgery, the infection is all gone finally and I can eat again, been stuck drinking ensure since Thursday, trouble is this poor girl is broker than broke, I have three of us to feed and dunno what i'm going to do for dinner, there is one can of soup in the cupboard. If someone would be willing to front me a pizza when i get paid next i'll gift one to someone. Pweeese?  EDIT :Also I don't have family...so there will be no thanksgiving meal for me this year, this would really be a nice happy thing, I could use it right at the moment :-( And PapaJohns is the chain we have here.  EDIT: This really would mean so much to me guys, I've never had to deal with getting a tooth pulled before and my face is just returning to normal, the last thing I need right now is stress, I have two others that live with me who haven't been able to find a job because of the economy so I'm the only one who works, this is going to put is in a tight spot and I'm still not sure how things are going to go but for tonight, the first night I have the ability to even have solid food, I don't want to worry.  Also if interested I can provide a picture of a very doofy looking dog, possibly two in exchange. 
49	False	a	I went out with some friends earlier in the week and ended up lending my friend 20 bucks til he could get to an ATM. Long story short, we ended up pretty silly drunk and crashed at different houses so he never got a chance to pay me back.  I get paid tomorrow and I could definitely tough it out, but I'd love to down a few slices before I spend the night cleaning up my apartment.   
50	True	a	Craigslist and bike riding the past three days and im just hungry! Help me out please? Pics will be provided!
51	True	a	Well, my rent is paid up until June, and [my cats](http://i.imgur.com/T7pmOh.jpg) have food. I just ate my last package of ramen, and I forgot to save some cash for me to eat!  I by no means need or deserve a pizza. I could‚Äôve planned out my spending a little better. [My fridge is empty](http://i.imgur.com/IXViD.jpg), but I do have some pasta or rice I could make.  Getting a pizza would be the highlight of my spring break. And when I get paid on Friday, I would love to pay it forward.  [Pizza received!](http://imgur.com/Phh2e) (4:51 PM CDT) Thank you, Your_Never_Alone!! 
52	False	a	Hi to all I am on here asking if someone with help a lady out .I am wanting a pizza but have no cash till next week .I am craving a cheese pizza .can anyone help me out please thanks.I will return the favor if I get one to a redditor next week so everyone be looking for me i get paid on tuesday.thanks
53	False	a	Been sick for a few days and I'm starting to run low on food, been eating   chips, ramen and other similar food items. I'll probably have to venture out to the store at some point, but I'd like to avoid the embarrassment and health risk of throwing up on the drive there and at the store.
54	False	a	Long story short I've been doing landscaping since March and I got laid off last Friday. I collected my last paycheck yesterday and paid the remainder of my bills for July. Exploring options for new income, but completely broke until then. Appreciate your time for reading this!
55	False	a	My boyfriend kicked me out of his car right in the middle of NYC. All I have on me is my phone. I have been crying my eyes out for the past hour. My purse is still in the car with my wallet, credit cards, id. I have no idea what to do now, I live 50 minutes away on car from the city. I didnt eat all day and would really want something to get my mind off this situation and try to get back home some way.
56	False	a	Would like a break from noodles. God. The noodles. They're everywhere. 
57	False	a	kinda skint at the moment, no cigs, empty fridge and won't have any money until friday :( a pizza would really hit the spot and cheer me up :) I've been in this predicament before and have considered asking here but I've never found it easy asking for stuff, letting pride get in the way I suppose, will pay it back when I can.
58	False	a	"hello friends.. it's Thursday, I'm far from home, I miss my family, and I could use a pizza..  &lt;3 I love this ""random acts of pizza""  how kind is that? "
59	False	a	My sister and I have been living off Publix cookies and a pizza would be freaking amazing right now.
60	False	a	I've been having a stressed out anxiety ridden week. I've had issues with my eating but not bad enough to be considered anorexic. So I've been eating sporadically. Sleeping not so well either.   I tend to use weed to help me actually want to eat. Well it's not really been working. Been smoking since yesterday and haven't gotten the desire to eat.   That is until I started thinking about pizza. I think I was even just reading the word pizza. I instantly started fantasizing about pizza. Then hit my brick wall when I remembered I have no money due to 4/20.  I know I need to eat, but I just can't see me putting in the effort to make something I'll actually eat.   
61	True	a	Hello everyone,  This is my first time here, I have just heard about it and decided to give it a shot since I have little food.  I live in Kent, WA and we just had a really big snowstorm which put my apartment out of power for 5 days, as well as about 400,000 other homes. I have already been struggling and what little food I had frozen has now been spoiled, even the milk in my refridgerator. I live pay check to pay check and I did not anticipate this, I do not even have the money to purchase a gallon of milk.  I was hoping one of the kind souls out there could gift me a pizza that I could enjoy with my son, it would really help so much as all we have is about 6 cup of noodles and 2 boxes of Mac and cheese (with no milk) to make it until payday this Friday.  If somebody could help me out I would be so happy, pizza from anywhere, it doesn't matter... Just something to eat.  I would gladly repay the favor forward when I get paid and gift somebody else in need.  Thank you for listening, Mikey
62	False	a	Hi guys, tomorrow is my birthday and I would REALLY love some pizza after a long day of classes. Any offer would be greatly appreciated! 
63	False	a	So, I'm stuck at work (a lan center in Grand Rapids, MI) since 7pm yesterday because of a lack of relief shift, and I have to work until 10am tomorrow*. I haven't had a chance to go home and pick up more food, and there's nothing in the work fridge, and I'm broke until payday next week. I ate the last of my lunch recently, so I won't need anything until later (11pm-12am or so, though I'm happy to stick it in the fridge if nothing's open that late). I'm more than happy to pay back a specific person next week on payday, or to just spread the love around to others when I can.  (* I volunteer, and spending this long down here doesn't bother me; I really do love helping out here. We lack employees that actually care, so I'm happy to take up the slack. I just lack the food to keep me going, is all.)
64	False	a	I left my house at 7:00 and I'm just getting home now, 9:00pm. The crazy long commute is a regular thing for me. It a pain in the ass. Oh, and my SO is gone for the weekend, no close friends are around and I have nothing else to do on this Friday night other than reddit and watching tv shows online.   Maryland...
65	False	a	[It's not even bunny shaped.](http://i.imgur.com/7x4O7.jpg)
66	True	a	I know it's a long shot by being in Denmark, if you want to help me you will probably need to be danish.  Willing to post proof of any kind.
67	False	a	Hey all, I love the stories I read on this subreddit of all you generous people, so here I am throwing myself upon your generosity.  My bank balance is looking decidedly negative, after shelling out money this last week for both my sisters upcoming birthday and mother's day.  About the only food I have at the moment is pasta, which I can eat if necessary, but I really fancy some pizza.  I have both a Dominos and Pizza hut nearby.  Thank you for reading and may your day's be ever full of pizza.
68	False	a	"Girlfriend left me last week, told me why last night-said that I didn't make her truly happy and that all of her ""I love you and won't leave"" has been a lie for the past undisclosed amount of time. Figure pizza might make me better. But all my money just went into my gas tank..."
69	False	a	Hey y'all, I'm pretty hungry and have to wait until tomorrow night for any money. I will draw you [well more like a sketch] anything, for some pizza. Plus I will be paying it forward tomorrow, double time, or maybe three times. (Most likely thrice!)  **EDIT:** Hey y'all never mind, you may ignore this post now, feel welcomed to request a drawing though, no pizza needed :)
70	False	a	I've been left at home all day in order to study for my Trial HSC (end of my last year of school before Uni), and I've found myself with a severe lack of food!  I know it's not the most urgent request, but a pizza would just be absolutely amazing right now, Reddit &lt;3  If it's not possible because I live in Australia, just tell me :P
71	False	a	Nobody is home, I can't drive and I have no monies. I live around the apple valley area. I believe there is a domino's in the apple valley area as well. I would deeply appreciate anyone's generosity. :)   Thanks!
72	False	a	It's a hungry day at the office (i'm self employed) and i'd be willing to do some web design work for you to show my immense gratitude. I can most likely complete whatever kind of project you need. 
73	False	a	I'm in my freshman year of college. I moved out to an apartment complex. I'm currently looking for a job. I ride a bike back and forth to school. I just really want some pizza and can't afford one right now! I live in the Gainesville area of Georgia.
74	True	a	My mom's disabled and I lost my job about 2 months ago now.  We live from my unemployment check at the moment. I'm very grateful to even get that much, but it doesn't go very far.  I'm job hunting like a mad man right now but no luck.  A pizza right now would seriously lift our spirits, it's been a hard few weeks and a few canned veggies to munch on until my next check a few days away is hard going.  I'll do whatever is needed to verify whatever you want.  Not sure I could stand on my head and take a pic or anything like that, not very physically fit. &lt;3  EDIT:  Pizza is here!! Thank you so much again!! http://imgur.com/A4z8I  Check out my mom's awesome house coat! :)  leftnewdigg made our entire week, thank you!!
75	False	a	I am a college student getting ready to graduate in a few months. I started working with my colleague a year ago in weddings to make money on the side.   Long story short things have not been working out for us very well. We haven't signed off any new clients, bills are starting to rack, and a pizza would go a long way for us. 
76	True	a	*note: I'm not actually desperate.  I realize that making you a song is a small thing, so I'm not going to ask you to send me a large pizza with lots of toppings or anything. Really, the most that I'm asking for is like a small pizza with no toppings. All I ask is that you keep the requests reasonable, and keep in mind that I'm not a millionaire, so I don't have access to a lot of things, such as realistic instruments like electric guitars or vibrant orchestras.  [Here's my soundcloud so you can get a jist of what my music sounds like, and the style I like to do.](http://www.soundcloud.com/slowfreq/)  NOTE: I'll PM you my address when I'm completed with your request.
77	False	a	I'm pretty hungry right now and jonesing to get my gaming on this uneventful Saturday night.  Any help would be great!  I'm in the Tucson, AZ area.
78	False	a	I've been trying to get pregnant for a while. :) I finally am. My husband is on a business trip out of town, and I am craving a pizza! (: !! I have a papa johns close by ! Anyone that can help, I will send them a $5dollar subway gift card. It's not much, but right now It's all I can do. Along with the gift card I can edit photos. Papa Johns Carryout closes at 10 here, and they won't deliver to my address! Any help would be appreciated, I can also give the gift card number so you know there IS $5 dollars on card. 
79	False	a	I just moved back to Brooklyn and slept on a living room couch for the past month. I am currently subletting an apartment but don't have a full time job. That means rent comes before food. I worked from 4pm on sunday to 6am this morning doing labor at the metropolitan museum and didn't eat during that time. Please help and when I am capable I will pay it forward. Thanks.
80	False	a	This week has been terrible, I lost a family friend to a car crash and my kitty (age 15)died on Christmas. I've done nothing but cry and post/read rage comics to try and keep my spirits up. I could really use some reddit love right now. I'm in Gatineau,QC (Aylmer)(near Ottawa)
81	False	a	Hello RAoP. I simply don't have money left after paying bills this month. I finished off the last of the rice earlier today and there is literally nothing left in the kitchen to eat. I ran out of options and am starting to get really hungry. If anyone could please help me out I would be extremely grateful and willing to do anything i can to repay you! Thanks.
82	False	a	The roommate's out, the boyfriend's having a night with his friends.  I'm a week away from turning 22 with no job and no social life (which is good I guess, because I'd be enticed to eat out more).  My family pays me to clean houses for them, but that $100 I make goes straight into groceries (now eaten twice as fast since the bf decided to save money buying lunch at work by having me cook when he's over; I don't mind, but he hasn't contributed much to the grocery bill) and gas.  I'm feeling pretty down tonight, but I'm not the worst off.  I have food in my apartment, and a car that runs.  But I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask. Anyone wanna float me a slice?  I'll draw just about anything you want.  I can do some half-decent portraits, manga was my old hobby, I can make some MLP characters... :P  All by hand, colored, for you.  Or I can send you pics of my roommate's cat and my cat.  Thanks for reading! &lt;3
83	False	a	I am a student looking for gastric entertainment.  If you are interested in offering a pizza, I will gladly accept and thank you graciously.  I will also gladly place an offer post when student loans are distributed (last week of August).  Need info?  PM me!  Thank you for your consideration.  P.S. I did the verification system.
84	False	a	As I said, turned 16 today, am stuck in a boarding school with no money, knee deep in work, was hoping for a celebratory pizza :)
85	False	a	I could really go for a ... anything besides ramen right now. I've been extremely frugal and thrifty lately due to budget constraints, and something with lots of carbs and cheese sounds absolutely succulent and delightful. Anybody care to grant mercy on this poor, pizzaless bastard? I promise to pay it forward! Also, I has a verification code.  Also willing to trade drawings (hand or MS paint) or simple/remote IT related tasks. Also has the Photoshop skills.
86	True	a	I posted a request already but basically, I have some food here at home but can't afford to go buy anything and my boyfriend and his girls and I are all craving pizza quite a bit.   (I can provide proof if need be)  Thought I would give this a try and and hopefully recieve a pizza! I solemnly swear to offer pizza in a couple weeks :)   Thanks!
87	True	a	Title pretty much says it all. No sob story, would simply love a pizza to help me through today!
88	False	a	Just as the title says.. I'm on contract right now, and only get paid once a month. Overspent a little last month, and now I'm stuck broke until my next check comes in.. Which might be tomorrow, or it could be late next week.  Will gladly offer a pie after I get paid.
89	True	a	Hey,  Thought I'd give this a try. Been broke for some time and no food in the house. When funds are available, I can pay it forward. Feel like a pizza, any help?
90	False	a	Hello!!!   I've heard great things about this subreddit and was hoping someone would help me out.   Had my hours cut at work, got paid last week only to spend it all by sunday catching up on bills.  Had to pay for car insurance or else my license would have been suspended ( almost reached day 30)  because I wasn't made aware I lost my insurance ( parents always took care of it). And Now the car's engine won't even kick over.   Stomach is growling and I have nothing but dry cereal ( which is something some people can't say I know. )  So I'm hoping one of you kind people will help me fill my belly.   I promise to pay it forward x2 this pay check (1st of February) and will make sure my benefactor receives confirmation if desired.   Please and Thank you you magnificent internet type people.   ~TD   Edit- An Empty Wallet :( 
91	False	a	No money until next friday : (
92	False	a	I just moved to a new city in Indiana (Evansville) with my boyfriend. Finally got a job but unfortunately I don't have any extra spending money until after Christmas (I am saving up for a nice present for my boyfriend.) We have milk and some random condiments in our fridge, as well as a lone strawberry poptart in the cupboard. I get payed tomorrow so I can buy a few essentials but tonight we have nothing but a milky poptart. Help?
93	False	a	"I do get paid tomorrow but my kind of out of food until then. The last remnants of my cash was in my wallet which I misplaced at the pride parade on Tuesday.   To top off my lack of funds and food I already have to go through the painful and humiliating act of calling up my credit cards to have them cancelled, get a new drivers license/health card and much more =.=... Just down on my luck a bit and could use a pizza.  Thanks :].  Used a throwaway because I really would rather not have my friends/family know of my situation at the moment.. strange double standards I have I know. I won't get help from my friends or family but I'll ask strangers on the internet &gt;&lt;"" I am willing to provide my actual account via pm :p"
94	True	a	My buddy and I just went on a mission across Chicago to supposedly pick up my paycheck. Turns out they didn't have it, and now we just spent our last dollar on two slurpees from 7-11.    Would love a pizza right now, and Papa Johns would seem like the best fit, seeing as how it's right down the street from where I'm by, but would take any of the big 3. Appreciate it.    Will pay it forward once my paycheck actually comes through.
95	False	a	As the title suggests, I've promised my girlfriend that I'd make dinner for the two of us tonight, however I woke up rather sick today. I lost my debit card recently and am currently waiting on a new one in the mail, otherwise I'd just order it myself. Will pay it forward as soon as I am able. Thanks!
96	False	a	Hi,   I just moved back to Bloomington after spending the last year taking care of my mother who was suffering from brain cancer. Sadly, she passed away last month, but thankfully is no longer suffering.   I've been back for about 3 weeks and have been having a very hard time finding work. I assume because it is a college town and during the summer many businesses are cutting staff and hours till the students come back in the fall.  I am working hard to get my life back in order after the loss of my mother and would appreciate from the bottom of my heart if someone was willing to donate a pizza for me to have tonight. My income has been extremely limited since helping to pay for funeral cost, my apartment's deposit and first month of rent, and bills, so any food is a blessing. I promise I will pay this act of kindness forward at my very first chance.  Thank you so much for reading and take care!
97	True	a	So pretty much your average run of the mill request. Me and my GF split up about a week ago, she is leaving and I am stuck with a lease I can't afford on my own, and have spent all my money paying for bills and gas to get to work. I don't get paid tell Friday and I have eaten through all the left over roman in the house. Could use a pizza to cheer me up and eat on for a few days. I'm not usually a requester and I am not horribly hard up, so if there is someone more deserving please choose them over me. Thanks for considering my request and happy pizza giving and what not. 
98	False	a	I would really appreciate a free pizza, I don't know if it works this specifically, but Pizza hut is the closest to my house. If not that, then Papa Johns. Please and thank you ahead of time, Keesha
99	True	a	It's my birthday, and I'm spending it hungry, alone, broke, amd homeless. I don't really want to ask for much, but I'm so hungry and I haven't eaten anything but dry cheerios for the past two days, and I just found out of this place. If anyone could help me, god, I would be so thanlful and appreciative. Anything I could do to return the favor or pay it forward, I swear I will do. Cause I mean, I know how it is, everyone has low points and needs help sometimes.
100	False	a	So last night I had a study group at my house and we were all finishing up the paperwork. Things are going well and everybody was laughing and having a good time. After we finished studying, we all smoked and got lifted and watched some show on Logo (gay channel) it was funny and we all kept on laughing. Next thing we know, this female (super plus size) asked if she could grab something to eat. I said sure not thinking that she would eat ALMOST EVERY FREAKING THING IN MY FRIDGE!!!! She did and I was sooooo blown that I told her she had to go. She apologized and said that she'll pay me back later in the week. So now I'm here asking if someone can help me out with a pizza so I can eat today. I don't get paid until Wednesday so all my money is on bills and gas. Help a brother out????? 
101	False	a	Spent all afternoon out in the cold because my older sister got in a fender bender.  Mom had a tooth pulled and is in too much pain to make dinner.  
102	False	a	Moving has sapped my bank accounts. I'm not starving or anything, but I've been eating nothing but peanut butter and jelly sandwhiches since Monday, and that's getting pretty old.   Is there a stranger that can help me eat something different tonight?  My paycheck doesn't get deposited until tomorrow, at which point I will certainly pay it forward.   Also, I am new to this subreddit. I think I understand how it all works, but bear with me. I am happy to provide verification/etc.
103	False	a	Scumbag Jackson Hewitt was supposed to have our tax return back for us already but they don't. we are hungry and would enjoy some tasty pizza!
104	True	a	  For the past months since I've been home from college my family's living situation has gone from bad to terrible.  My mom has been in and out work for even longer, and its been difficult to keep food in the home. Along with my Dad skipping out of child support payments and bills looming it hasn't been easy.     Me and my brother have been basically eating fried rice and beans for the last few weeks and could really use a decent meal like a hot fresh pizza.  
105	False	a	Anyone would be so kind to send me pizza? My lawnchair fell over and it was devastating to me and my family. My mother couldnt cook today because of this. We just sat together today recounting the tragedy that occured upon our lawnchairs. A day like today makes us grateful to be alive.
106	False	a	I'm a homeless mother of 3 kids in Bloomington IN. My case worker told me about this page and I thought I would give it a shot. If you could help me and my kids for the night I would be very grateful. We're staying in a hotel for the night that my mom is paying for and she is letting me use her computer. I hope you'll reply. thank you so much!
107	False	a	http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/ihc7v/found_a_dudes_iphone_4_in_boston_last_night/
108	False	a	Just heard about this and rather than request a pizza for myself I thought how fun would it be for a surprise pizza to show up for the Adoption and Lifesaving staff at the animal control shelter I volunteer with several times a week.  Its a rainy and miserable day, the shelter is extremely overcrowded meaning the days are stressful and filled with tough decisions being made for space.  I wouldnt want them to know its from my request but just a random act of Pizza sent there way for all their hard work.   The staff are there until 8pm Eastern time.  Im actually headed over to walk some dogs this evening and would love to see them enjoying a surprise pizza :)    Even if we cant make it happen tonight..maybe another night/afternoon this week.   Pizza can always make a bad day a little better! 
109	False	a	I am on my 3rd day of the flu. I have no money or groceries.
110	False	a	Today's my 28th birthday. And it's 10/11/12. Much to celebrate, in my opinion. I'm hungry and need something to help me celebrate. :)
111	False	a	We have two children - both under the age of 4 - and three adults who have been eating nothing but rice for almost two weeks. We have no money for food let alone anything else. I heard about your RAOP Kindness and wanted to know if we could have some sent this way. 
112	False	a	First time caller, long time listener. Hurricane Irene laid down some serious butt-hurt in good old colonial Williamsburg: A tree fell on our friends house, our basement flooded, and best of all, we've been without power since Saturday, and the electric company says it'll probably be back on... by Friday. So we basically had to cook all our room temperature meat that was in the freezer and hand it out to friends. Now we have no food, no power, and can't afford to eat out for every meal. We're just some poor college guys in a shitty situation, and could really use a RAoP.
113	False	a	I know I am new at this website but my friend suggested me to come on here for the fact of how kind and generous you people are... low on funds will get my paycheck tomorrow but all my check is going to my rent and bills got approved for snap that will not be getting that till next week.. have no vehicle and no way to go to the food pantry there are not walking distance from here and it's 95 degrees outside I've been eating nothing but raman noodles all week and I'm sick of it a pizza would go a long way I will be sure to return the favor as soon as I get extra money thank you and god bless
114	False	a	Hey i have never used this before but have no money so thought i would give it a try. I would really love to have a pizza right now. And would appreciate someone to buy me one. Then i will owe you a favour. lol 
115	False	a	having the very worst of luck lately... i could go into detail, but you've probably seen plenty of sob stories already... the long story short version: ABSOLUTELY NOTHING positive has happened to me over the month of november... and i'm moving thursday when i get paid (hopefully enough to cover the move)  i tried this once before but to no avail so here goes again... and once i'm settled and maybe have a tiny bit of good luck at all paying it forward will be on the top of my to do list... 
116	False	a	Playing Blacklight: Retribution, it's awesome. Today is my 20th birthday, which is also awesome. I don't have any awesome food though, just ramen  and cheap mac'n'cheese. It's tragic as I get paid TOMORROW! I just moved here to socal and none of my family knows my new address to send any possible cards. I've got $0.62 in my bank but I'm a registered caregiver for my mom so it's pretty relaxed here, her paycheck is rent, mine is everything else. Broke till tomorrow, would fancy a pizza pie.  http://i.imgur.com/T1f3v.png 
117	False	a	There are 2 families on my block that each have a young boy. The family to my front is leaving to return home tomorrow (self deportation after a traffic stop). I've had a blast the last 2 years watching these kids grow up and play together and feel like shit that they are likely never going to see each other again. They are 5 or 6 I'm guessing.  Will someone please get these kids a last meal to share? I know illegal immigration is a Huge issue in the US, but fuck man, we're talking about children, and the kid leaving has never been out of Florida, let alone been to Mexico.  Thanks.   Eta: In Florida and we have Pizza Hut, Dominos, and Papa John's in the area.
118	False	a	Short on cash this summer, currently taking summer B classes at Usf I'm a out of town student low on funds and a friend told me that site helps. Not looking for much just something to hold me over through to the weekend..Thanks 
119	False	a	Hey, i'm new to this but my friend just told me about this site. I have just moved to Centralia and got my apartment. I spent all my money for rent and have no money until the 12th. It'd be highly appreciated if someone would be able buy me a Large Pepperoni Pizza from Dominos and I will be able to pay you back. Please and thank you.
120	False	a	I have about -$5 in my bank account and a beyond maxed out credit card that I can't even make payments toward. I just moved for a new job and am not getting nearly as many hours as I was told, so with my apartment bills, truck bills, gas to get to and from work, I really only have enough to live off rice, ramen, boxed mashed potatoes, etc. Broke college student is broke and needs a break. So if somebody could find it in them to buy a pizza, any pizza, any size, any toppings, whatever, I will be forever grateful.
121	False	a	I'll spare you the sob story, but some pizza would really make my day. Please and thank you! edit. First time posting. My location is Grand Junction CO USA. 
122	False	a	Not gonna lie, I could go and buy a pizza for myself and my kids (wife's out of town on business for the next couple of weeks) but I just found this and it's a pretty cool idea so I figured I'd give it a shot!  Garlic Jim's is a little on the pricy-er side, we usually get Papa Murphy's Take'n'Bake, but can't beat the garlicky goodness that is Jim's!  Thanks Reddit!  Edit: As has been pointed out to me, I should have included this: I live in Lynnwood, WA. Thanks again!
123	False	a	I've got a guitar in one hand and the other is a pizza pie?
124	False	a	broke till i get paid next friday would really love some pizza right now
125	False	a	I haven't slept in 2 weeks. I discovered those 5hr energy type drinks and well... I have a ton of work from work and a ton of free lance work. A pizza would cheer me up and I will gladly pay it forward at the end of the month when I get paid.
126	False	a	This is actually the long story short believe it or not, please excuse my terrible grammar its very late, and humans do not have an effective way of communicating how terrible a time my father and I are going through.  I was forced to move in with my father and his second wife, (then my stepmom) I had to withdraw from my college classes mid semester and quit my job. After living with my father who is schizophrenic bi-polar it became clear that he was extremely depressed by his living situation. He was being used by his wife for money, my father is the kind of person that when you ask something of him it is hard/next to impossible for him to say no. My father was paying rent, utilities, and iphones for 5 members of my stepmother's family. This literally used up 100% of my fathers money monthly. He would stay at home and do nothing but surf and web and read books, all the while my stepmother would use her disability money to buy shit we could not afford and routinely overspend and cause us to have overdraft fees that my father had no way to pay for, I've covered for her mistakes countless times, whenever she overspends she sells something of the family's to cover for her mistakes, the last thing she sold was the family kayak which was bought before they were married, all the while she still would use checks that were in her name to buy fancy furniture, and useless junk. To make matters worse, the stepmother has a son who SMOKES coke and w/e else he can get his hands on. This waste of life step brother of mine decided to get his GF pregnant who then popped out twins (they are religious and don't believe in abortion) The drug addict stepbrother is now a father of two kids when he cannot even support himself, he and his GF have been on welfare since the babies were born and neither have gotten a job or even tried to get their GEDs (yes they dropped out of high school) Now the stepmother spends most of her money on supporting the two kids and her fuck up son, she gives him cash to buy pot, cigs (which they smoke in a closed garage with the kids) I witnessed my stepbrother use his food stamps to buy only ice cream instead of getting real food for his kids and himself. At one point my father confided in me that he had considered suicide, this eneraged me and I decided I would do anything in my power to show my father that this leach of a stepmother cared nothing for him and was using him (he was in love with her and was in denial) I ended up getting evidence that my stepmother had pawned my father digital camera when she said that he had probably lost it. My father confronted her about it and she stood fast in her lie, my father then saw the light that this women was indeed using him and cared nothing for her. (in their 4 years of marriage they only had sex once and on their anniversary my father got her flowers, a card and wanted to take her to dinner but, she ended up going to see her fuck up son's kids instead.) The evidence of her using him continued to rise and rise for a few months until my father decided that he was going to tell her that he wanted a divorce. She ended up ripping out our internet and storming off to her mother's while texting my dad that she wanted the divorce too and that we were not to damage any of her property (oh the irony) or that she would make the divorce as hard as possible and take as much as she could. This was about a week ago and we have begun packing our stuff and preparing to move out, she has no intention of helping pay for the cancellation fees for the phones/net/tv ect. Together we have gotten enough money to pay for one more month so that we have time to move out and into my father's parent's house. Current between the two of us we have about 10$ until our next paychecks and have been eating at my father's parents. I have had to witness my father cry and think of ways to comfort him, he knows that this bitch doesn't really care for him and it is for the best that he gets the divorce but its all really overwhelming even for me, I can't imagine what it is like for a person with a disability such as his. I don't even know what to provide for proof but here is a hate email that my stepmother sent my father after he told her he wanted a divorce, its actually comic at some parts and really shows her true colors, some context though, I clean up after myself not my stepbrother and his two kids.  ***YOU chose to allow your son to attack me and NEVER SAID HE WAS TO STOP!!!! A true husband protects his wife from everyone. Instead you sat there only saying I was to calm down. He is a spoiled brat because you never had him in your life. Where was he all those years until HE was going to be on the street. He disrespected your ex who you claim to care so much about. He has anger issues ANGER ISSUES. TEARING DOWN A DOOR God, what would he do to ME, someone he hates, if I didn't stand up to his lies. I fully intend to prove your precious camera, which, btw was purchased in your manic fit. We had all your fancy cameras as well as a perfectly good digital. Now, you make IT and that little devil separate us. I believe in Jesus Christ and AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE, I WILL SERVE THE LORD. He believes in the internet..... PERIOD. I stopped feeling safe in my home when he attacked me the first time. He climbs on your lap makes me sick that you cannot see his making fun of you when he shakes your belly. He is a sick puppy. Everyone who has seen the ghostly boy says he is way strange the way he stays in his room all the time.  I told you the sex was what I got hurt doing. I never spoke up as to why, but when you dropped the dream of the surgery I knew you wanted to be diabetic and heavy all your life. I lost respect for you because even your family was encouraging you. For all I know anyway, maybe they weren't and you hid it from me. All I know is you don't ever want to go do anything and I am a very active person when I am having a good day from absence of pain. At least I see people when I go shopping and I recycle instead of buying expensive items we cannot pay for.  I have tried hard to keep a nice home for you and you have to be reminded to CLEAN CAT LITTER AND FEED. I can't do it all without feeling USED!  I raised my kids to help out...what happened to your Ryan, he is above lifting a finger. Does he even know how to clean his own (mostly his) bathroom. Cleaners are right on shelf and I have pretty towels that makes it nice and he chooses to disrespect and not use his towels instead. What disrespect.  I am not a happy person now or before I left there.  I hope you are happy that you allow your baby boy to separate us. YOU DID THIS.  My son WILL BE HELPING ME MOVE SO MAKE RYAN GO TO HIS MIKEY'S HOUSE WHEN WE ARE MOVING. My Son is angry for what unhappiness his Mother is under because of little boy Satan. Dustin told me two months ago that Ryan is pushing us to divorce. Pretty smart boy who adores his Mom. Dustin and Roy protect Me like you will not. ***  I have no idea if anyone will even read all this as it is 2 am and I did a horrible job of explaining our situation but if anyone would like clarification you can add me on skype rcroslin@live.com 
127	False	a	I am really encouraged by this subreddit but am still a bit disbelieving that random strangers are so willing to help one another.  I am a major pessimist and, while I try not to be, I almost always tend to think the worst eventuality will happen at any given moment.  So, here we are.  I am supposed to start online classes for my master's degree on Monday and I actually have to ship my computer off for repairs because it is seriously messed up and the warranty ends in 10 days.  :( Sigh, it's not so much the inconvenience of going to the library, etc.  It is just that I feel like anytime I take a step forward, I get kicked two steps back.    A hot pizza on a Saturday night would pick up my spirits a bit and my husband would also definitely enjoy it.  He works as a cook and is always exhausted once he comes homes.  The last thing he wants to do is cook dinner and I am a BIT of a kitchen nightmare.   Thanks guys!  Edit:  near Milwaukee, WI!  I tried to post yesterday but it never showed up in the thread. :( 
128	False	a	I'm stationed at WPAFB. My pay got all jacked up and they took everything back at once. That's a lot of money. Anyone in the air force understands how fucked finance can be. I crashed my car last week, my computer screen broke, my phone isn't working. I'm currently typing this in the tiny area of my screen that still works. I hate asking for charity since I've been poor all my life. But I've had such a bad run the past few weeks and I'm burnt out and flat broke. And since it's my food allowance, (BAS) that is fucked up, I can't eat at the dining facility on base using my military ID. I'd really appreciate some help, guys. If not, that's cool. I have oatmeal. I'm just so tired of oatmeal..  edit: When I get back on my feet, I intend to pay it forward. I believe wholeheartedly in that philosophy.
129	False	a	Hey everyone, i was referred to this site by a dear friend of mine. I am writing because I am requesting dinner for me and my boys tonight. My husband has to work until 11 tonight and i have been sick all day long (pregnant) and honestly dont have the strength to make a meal for my babies. We havent had anything fun for a while because ive had so many complications and this would be a great treat to the boys tonight. They have been so good today with me being sick and I would be so thankful if someone could bless us!  We are located in hinesville, ga. We have a pizza hut, dominoes, papa johns!
130	False	a	I wanted to say I'm absolutely heart broken, but didn't want to give the wrong impression.  I don't know why, buy my best friend that I've spent all of the last year spending every free second with, suddenly wants very little to do with me and is causing me to feel extremely left out with all of our mutual friends.  Plus, I've honestly never loved someone more than her, so I don't know if I've ever hurt this much before.  It's terrible and confusing.  On top of that, a couple friends suddenly suffering from massive depression, drug use, and self harm, trying desperately to take care of them and am just so so drained and lonely because of everything.  Just trying to get past these next two weeks with tons of school work and exams, so hoping for some pizza or just some Reddit love and motivation would help with the loneliness and anxiety.
131	True	a	[This is the game - a year old version anyway](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=108111747) Note: I'm in Hungary, pizza place accepts credit/debit cards.
132	False	a	First of all, I just wanted to say that I love pizza, more than life itself. It would make things just a little better, especially with how things are for us right now.   Things have been spiraling downward lately. Me and my girlfriend were both laid off from our jobs, and since we had no money we were evicted from our apartment. We had friends willing to help us out, but they ALL told us at the last minute that they'd changed their minds. We ended up having to stay with my girlfriend's abusive parents (which was a nightmare in itself), and they decided to kick us out. On Christmas day nonetheless.   We're staying with a friend now while we look for jobs. I'm not sure how long we can stay here even if we do get jobs, but I do know that having a pizza would make this whole mess a little more bearable.
133	False	a	There is a total of six people living in our small apartment. There isn't a much income coming in because it's extremely hard to find jobs out where I am. I've been doing odd jobs for the past six months or so just trying to scrape together money to help my grandma pay for our rent.   I only eat a couple times a week because there isn't enough food to go around.   If someone sends us a pizza, it would hold us over for about a week. It would be greatly appreciated.   **EDIT:** I live in Youngstown, OH.   **I will draw and send you a picture of anything you want as payment.**
134	False	a	I'm close to out of food for this month and could use a pizza. My new job isn't going to pay till the end of the month. I am interested in either paying you back or paying it forward. Any amount is okay and appreciated. :)  Edit: living in Vancouver WA area.
135	True	a	Just paid to have my bank account fixed, and paid rent! Had to use all of my birthday money for bills and such. I am STARVING! I have no cash left, and no food until Weds. and I mean noooo food! I am willing to order a pizza for someone as soon as I get paid on April 30th! Will provide photograph of bank account to show you how poor I am! 
136	False	a	New to Reddit, guys on 4Chan sent me this way so hopefully I strike a cord with someone. To sum it all up, here's the general overview of my life since April of this year.   I used to work for a major cell phone carrier answering calls from the general public. I liked my 9 dollars an hour, then they fired me, for taking 3 days off in a row because I couldn't get to work (I couldn't miracle up a car to drive while mine was getting fixed). Seems unlikely right? Well this is Sprint we're talking about, the same people who offer to take $25 off your bill when you call to complain about their wonderful service. They don't bother to tell you it extends your contract by a year and removes your upgrade eligibility, and if you ask odds are they'll lie about it. Speaking from experience, 90% of my coworkers in my department didn't know that. So as you can tell nothings beneath them. If you have any questions about Sprint I'll happily clear them up, there's a way around almost anything lol.  I've tried my best to be self supportive up until now. I cut a few yards every month, sold all my worldly possessions, I even defaulted on my car payments with just 4 to go. You know, the usual stuff. I also tried the unusual, for a week I was selling male enhancement pills from home in my spare time. Then the company went under lol. Just as well, they were nothing but banana peel powder and saccharin anyway. Oh and crab shells or some crap like that, I dunno, I didn't keep the bottle they gave me.  My family's been real supportive through all this, my uncle even changed his phone number without telling me. Ironically I hadn't even asked for anything from them, they saw my post on twitter and deserted me on the spot. I'm the only one in the family who owns his own home, and the only one who hasn't begged the grandparents for anything. After all, I've always managed on my own, so my uncle probably figures I can do it again. Of coarse when his mule faced wife wanted a tummy tuck and a boob job done last year, they asked me to keep her in my prayers. Fair weather family is like that, thank goodness I'm the youngest. I take solace in that I'll be alive and dragging my butt on their graves long after they're dead. Might even take a wizz, gotta water the grass ya know?  Since I got fired I don't get unemployment, and I'm a natural born tax paying citizen living near a major metropolitan city, so there isn't any government programs I qualify for either. Work prospects are bleak at best, especially since now I'm without wheels. I tried doing the day labor gigs they have down at the local employment office, line was already a hundred people long when I got their, 3 hours early x.x Tried finding religion to see if the divine spirit would help with any of my problems, then I found out God gives you hardships to make you stronger. Sure enough my gas stove died later that week, so as these and countless other things continue to stack up I find myself getting stronger and stronger. You can't tell because of this fat exterior but man, underneath all that I'm built like a brick house.  So that's some of it, if I got into all of it we'd be here all day. I just want a couple bucks worth of pizza or maybe a couple of those sandwiches Dominos makes, that'd greatly improve my mood here in the short term. Tomorrow and Thursday I'll be glued to the phone hoping that for the first time since April I'll get offered a job. If nothing else wish me luck on that. Also if anyone's interested in buying whatever curse I've been afflicted with I'm selling it on the cheap =)
137	False	a	Hello,  30 year old from TX panhandle area So anyway, i'm struggling! I live in a rural community with hardly any jobs or places to work, and i work online the best i can on surveys and writing articles etc.  I am a remote PC technician and have lots of experience with IT/tech field, but no clients in this area.   I haven't ate for almost 3 days and haven't smoked cigarettes either, because i can't afford them, and actually feel a little better, I just have periods where I want to HULK SMASH everything in my apartment!  I do however have 7mg patches that i acquired from the VA administration.  Yes i'm a veteran, but do you really think just because you signed a contract with the federal government they are going to take care of you for the rest of your life? No.  People that deserve disability have to fight for years to get more percentage of benefits and it's hard.  I am on hud but there is no income.  I offer my services for pizza or paypal  I can Remote in to your desktop or laptop PC only, SCREW APPLE!! and optimize and speed up your system.  No files will be viewed including photos and documents.  You can sit in front of the computer and end the connection at any time.  Will update and make sure you have proper protection and use the latest greatest software downloaded and installed right in front of your eyes.   I Can NOT remote in without a unique identifier and cannot do it again without authorization from you.  Services like this from major corporations can cost up to $200 dollars just for the same thing i offer and will accept pizza or donations.  ]      Today i mowed a large area with someone i know to try and get money, yet that small amount of money is being saved so i can pay my late fees and rent that is accruing which is $100.  Since i haven't ate in a while i got very dizzy and lightheaded and heat exhaustion,  I am recovering from the heat, but hunger has set in.  If i violated anything i'm sorry, this is my first time on here i was referred by an online friend. Thank You for reading and your time!!!  
138	False	a	This is my first time here, I would love to see how it works. So, may I please have a pizza. 
139	False	a	I just started classes and got done paying over $500 for my books.  Now my fridge is empty and i would really love for the chance to get a pizza.  I always see how well you guys do when i see the posts of other redditors getting pizza, i just hope you can help me out.
140	False	a	After filling my car up with outrageous gas prices I'm not going to be able to get any food and do not have any in my dorm. I'm starving and would like to eat today and I would be very grateful for a nice pie.
141	False	a	I just barley made my rent this month with literally the last cent from an old coin jar I had. I'm greatly relieved, yet oddly depressed looking at my now empty coin jar.   Is anyone willing to help cheer up a broke redditor with some pizza while I figure what my next step is to be? In any case, thank goodness for the power of the penny and thanks for reading!  To Mods: Thanks for posting a link /r/Food_Pantry in the sidebar. Never knew about that! Might be a lifesaver this month! :D  Edit:Grammar and comma
142	False	a	So uh me and my Friend are gonna be playing some FIFA 12 and smoking some...tobacco. Uh. So. Pizza would be rad.  If you'd be willing to wait until Friday when I get paid, I'll buy your wonderfully nice face a pizza to munch on, too.   if I can be nitpicky, no dominoes. I like, y'know, good, edible pizza. :3
143	False	a	I thought I could just tighten a few screws.....ended up spending 142.00 on a new faucet.  I just got called in to work.  I would love to leave a pizza or two with my family, but the faucet and work seem to foiled my plans.
144	False	a	"Hello Redditors!  Like the title says, my girlfriend and I are writing a ""How to lease your first apartment"" guide for all the new freshman and sophomores who are going to start signing leases next week. See, around here the apartment companies build up this hype that all of the best apartments will be gone if you don't sign on Oct 5th. This is such shit! We were able to both get out of really shitty leases and move into a great place halfway through the year and pay less than what . By perpetuating this myth, the leasing offices show kids shitty apartments and make them believe that these are the best ones that are ""left"" and that the students should pay $400 - $600 per PERSON for these shit holes.   Basically, we are writing a guide for these students so they wont get screwed. I know that you guys are namely good at giving out pizza (which would be greatly appreciated) but any good advice you have for leasing an apartment is appreciated as well!   Edit: On Illinois State University campus. Any /r/ilstu -ers out there?  My rough outline: [Dropbox Link to Document](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6234318/Lease%20Stuff.docx)"
145	False	a	After almost a year of unemployment I finally got a job today! I haven't started yet so I'm still broke. My girlfriend spent the last of her money on beer last night so we could celebrate, so now I'm severely hungover and in dire need of pizza. Thanks!
146	False	a	This might seem odd, but I have had a fairly bad and disappointing birthday. I've been having a generally difficult week leading up to today and I would just appreciate a pick me up today.
147	False	a	Im a father of one son and I have a fiance, both living with me. Times have been so rough the past couple of months financially. I was collecting unemployment while i was actively searching for a new job and luckily was blessed last week with finding one. I just started work but unfortunately my unemployment didnt go on this month and I wont get a paycheck for a couple more weeks as they hold back for a week and pay bi-weekly. we are desperate for food, even tried going to a food bank but they they arent open til wednesday and we have nothing for me or my fiance or son to eat til then. I hate asking for assistance from others but Ive never been in this bind before and I'm really hoping someone out there could bless us with a pizza for dinner. It would be amazing, and I would be more than happy to pay it forward with my first check to another needy family facing the same difficulties as we are at the moment. Thank you all for reading my long post and bless you  .... We are located in KY btw
148	False	a	I have been living of top ramen for the past two weeks is there any way anybody could get me a domino pizza i have forgotten what real food tastes like.
149	False	a	"Been rough the last two weeks due to a mishap with my army pay. So Ive gotten down to the bare bones nothing on money till Friday. I know sounds all ""Meh a begger"" but I will 100% repay the kindness with a meal of your own friday. I believe in the firm policy of treating others fairly."
150	False	a	I got a good 40 miles in during the 4-5 hours of sunshine on Friday, but the steady on/off of rain around the state has kept me out of the saddle the rest of the week. I haven't had a delivery pizza in over a month after getting serious about my diet, but I've been drooling thinking about crispy pepperonis and stringy cheese lately. I could use a cheat day, would anybody like to help quell these cravings? 
151	False	a	I'm hanging out with my friends and we are about the watch a Batman movie marathon before we go see the Dark Night Rises again tomorrow. But my parents left me without any food in my house. I've given them drinks, but i assume we are going to get pretty hungry soon.  I'll draw a picture of batman as a reward! Thanks.
152	False	a	My friends and I are studying for the finals right now and I thought it would be nice to surprise them with a pizza - to show my gratitude because we have been studying together for three nights in a row but I don't have any cash with me right now. So help me out? We all like cheese by the way.
153	False	a	I've got a killer headache from working on college shit all day (and the minecraft pre-release). Anyone care to send a pizza my way so I don't have to bother with cooking?  Coalton, Ohio.
154	False	a	A good three months ago, a family welcomed me into their home when I was living on the streets. I was homeless, broke and starving when they saved me. Now, I am on my feet thanks to them and they are moving tomorrow because of a family emergency. Since all of the food is packed up, I would like to get them a pizza but I do not have the money to do this until I get paid next Friday, which will be to late, so I will pay forward. Many thanks
155	False	a	Now, don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with Ramen. It's gotten me through some tough times, and it's getting me through them right now. My girlfriend gets off work in 15 minutes and then faces a 3 hour bus ride home from her call center (she has the most inconveniently scheduled layovers on her route...she has to sit at the transit station for an hour either way she does it). I just moved to the area to be with her because I love her, and haven't been able to find a job to help support us yet, which is unfortunate because her roommate just bailed on her. I did manage to secure a 200/mo food stamp benefit, which renews on the first of the month. But we couldn't manage to make it stretch the whole month our first time around, and we've been living off Ramen since the weekend. I'm sure we'll be able to properly ration ourselves next month, if we're more careful. And I have no problem living on ramen. I just want to do something nice for her since I feel like I'm sitting on my ass all day not contributing anything, looking for jobs on craigslist while she's away at work/stuck on the bus. She's been really upset about the money situation lately, and I just want her to be happy. Unfortunately, she is not as pleased with the Ramen diet as I am. I would give anything to be able to give her something better than this to come home to.  Sorry for that wall of text/sob story. I don't expect anything but I'm not doing anything right now but sitting on my ass waiting for her to get here, so posting this can't hurt.   edit: Thank you reddit! Pics will be posted as thanks!  edit 2: As promised, her [face when she found out](http://i.imgur.com/k8bmxh.jpg)  [AWWWWWW YEAHHHHHH](http://i.imgur.com/kpcZdh.jpg)
156	False	a	Me and my brother are without food tonight. We were counting on some assistance from a friend, but it fell through.We'd appreciate any help to tie us over until tomorrow, will pass this forward ASAP. Thanks in advance
157	False	a	My mom is Broke until Oct and I'm 15 and have no job. We have nothing in the fridge/freezer. Both of her bank accounts are negative (If you want proof I will happily provide, of course some things will be blurred out) All we want really is a Pizza. In the past when I tried to order they don't deliver where we live. (In the mountains) so we could always go and pick up.   Thanks for reading.
158	False	a	Hey out there in pizza land.  We are a family of 6 with a 3 week old.  It is 100 degrees and we have no AC.  The baby has been crying because it is just too hot for him.  I can't possibly turn the stove on tonight, if we could get out of this house and go grab a pizza somewhere, all the kids would really appreciate it tremendously.  Thanks to all who inhabit this site!
159	False	a	Pretty please and thank you from me and Dog.
160	False	a	Down on my luck lately and no gas or money to do anything of importance (or fun) on the 4th. Something simple as a pizza would really make my day. I've been a long time lurker and I don't really participate in commenting or posting but definitely could use some good luck.
161	True	a	It always hurts me to ask others for help.  I'm at my fathers apartment right now. Today is his first day at a new job, thank the lord! Well, he left today and I don't know what time he will come home. His job is to help people move, so I doubt he'll be home anytime soon. He found this job after months of unemployment, so there's not much in our fridge other than cold franks. A hot pizza would really hit the spot for me right about now. I made this throw-away account because I have friends who frequent Reddit, and I would not want them to see me in despair. Thank you in advance, Reddit.  Tl;dr Dad left for new job. At apartment alone. Nothing in fridge. 
162	False	a	Hey there guys I was just flicking through random subreddits and I stumbled on this! Well you probably get starving students all the time I guess. I'm a second year at Otago uni but I'm still only 17, meaning I live on the unsupported child benefit instead of the Student Allowance. After rent and power I have 70$ per week to live on (that's NZD too); the thing is I brought two 16$ posters for my room in my new flat (kinda a mistake) and now I'm kinda starving. Been eating nothing but noodles and these cheap (disgusting) beef patties all week.   So yeah I'd appreciate a pizza SO MUCH! I'd be willing to post a funny pic or whatever if that's what people usually do here? cheers guys!
163	False	a	So yesterday I had a really rubbish day - feeling poorly, clients being awful and generally things not going too well. I got home to find my car with a parking ticket because the council put the wrong license plate number on my permit which I hadn't noticed (and I'm a learner so I couldn't move the car), then today I got hit with a load of bank charges for stuff from August, when I was already worrying how I would get through to payday this month because of a bunch of unexpected payments. I have enough in my account for my phone bill, and maybe enough food in cupboard/freezer to manage my meals til payday. I am feeling pretty crap and I'm stuck at work wishing I was under my duvet. Does anyone feel like making my day and gifting me a pizza before I commit to three weeks of beans on toast?  I'll be in a better situation after payday I promise to either repay anyone who would be kind enough to help, or gift someone next month.   Thanks for reading! 
164	False	a	So, I won't bore you with the gruesome details. Last night, I had a really good time with some friends, and this morning, the charming head of mental illness decided to punch the good times clean out of me. I was awful to the people that I love, and now I'm on my own, too frightened out of my mind of what they think of me to talk to anybody. I probably don't deserve this, but I just need to eat something - I haven't been able to in a few days, and my stomach is making some ungodly noises.  I wouldn't normally ask, but my bank account is already in overdraft, and I don't ask for much - I have a usual order, and it comes to just over a fiver. If anyone could help, I will definitely pay it forward should you ever be in need. God knows, I've got plenty to make up for.
165	False	a	Hey all i live in a very small town in iowa we have like 3 places to eat  in this town, pizza hut , subway , hardees i unfortunately dont get paid until friday and our food is running low, anyway, me and my wife have decided to on here to try and get a pizza and if we dont succeed we will try to create flour noodles !? and those dont sound appetizing to be honest .
166	False	a	I'm so hungry and I'm sick of having to only eat beans and tuna sandwiches, My dad works all day and my mom... well shes not in a good place so I have no money right now and I'm gonna starve. :( please.
167	False	a	Things are a bit tight right now, but I'll be able to repay at the end of the month. Christmas pizza, yay =)  A bit about me, if it interests you- I'm currently a full time volunteer (like in the Peace Corps, but not called the Peace Corps) working at a small nonprofit in DC. I live in a big house with 12 other volunteers (I am NOT requesting pizza for 12 people, goodness xD) I just learned how to ride a bicycle last summer, and I play a bunch of instruments.  Thanks for looking =)
168	False	a	 
169	False	a	After a few very nerve-racking days, my uterus finally kicked into gear today, and despite the bleeding, gut-wrenching cramps, and splitting headache I feel the triumphant relief of knowing that my birth control pill functioned as it was supposed to, that I am not pregnant, and that my boyfriend and I do not have a crisis on our hands.  We're at home today, me downing tylenol for the pain and him trying his adorable best to keep the mood swings at bay. We'd totally appreciate pizza as we celebrate the cycle of womanhood, the invention of birth control pills, and the fact that our few sexytimes-sans-condom this past month did not end in procreation.  Thanks for your time and consideration, and I hope that this post isn't too NSFW in content/attitude for this board - I had to inject some humor into the situation to alleviate some of the prior stress of it. :) 
170	False	a	Well just got done workin, Dont get paid till Friday, Would LOVE something delicious tonight, I dont get paid till friday and would be glad to RAOP it Forward then! Not sure if it matters but Its just me in the household so wouldnt cost a whole lot :)  Edit**  A $10 dinner box from pizza hut would be amazing :) comes with everything, Pizza, Stix, and Desert!
171	False	a	I'm just being random and asking for a random person to send me a pizza. My life is okay, school is going decent, and I'm not dirt poor. I would really like a pizza because I'll be home alone tonight as my roomates are going out with their girlfriends and I'd prefer not to be a third wheel. My dog would appreciate the crust. Thanks.   Will provide picture of said dog with crust if my request is fulfilled. 
172	False	a	i haven't eaten all day but it's raining out and i don't have a car. Still looking for a job and I'm a broke college student!
173	False	a	My husband, 10 month old son and I are in the middle of a move. He just got out of the military so we can't leave just yet even though all of our belongings are packed and have been picked up. The only thing we have to eat is ramen and being the moron I am, I packed all of our pots and our microwave...everything required to make ramen edible. Please don't make us eat cold and undercooked ramen tonight. 
174	False	a	I'll be honest, I'm not going to starve without it. However, I'm trying to power through and get a bunch of A.P. homework done and could really go for some pizza.  Location: Southern Oregon.    Papa John's is the only one that will deliver.  I don't have enough gas to go pick one up.  EDIT: No longer needed. 
175	False	a	So I basically am not starving or dying or have been hit by a storm but I had pizza for my brothers friends coming over but my friends took the frozen ones i bought the other night... so basically if you wanna help a brother out in the next few hours that would be great haha!
176	False	a	Haven't been getting many hours at work, and getting the hours I do get cut. Don't have money to pay my bills or even my rent due next week. I've been eating mostly cereal and pasta, which is almost gone. I would love something different. Pizza sounds amazing. Please and thank you everyone!
177	False	a	Last week I deposited my paycheck but for some reason Regions decided to not make the funds available for 3 days, so after using my debit card a few times, I'm now officially -$412 in the hole.  I get paid again tomorrow, and I do have 1 package of ramen left, but I'm 25 weeks pregnant and it's just not going to cut it for the whole day.  So, if anyone is feeling generous I would greatly appreciate a little help! Edit - I realize since I'm using a throwaway this may seem suspicious, but I can provide proof to anyone who wants it.  Empty fridge, ultrasound pic, etc.
178	True	a	I only get paid once a month and I spent the last of it taking care of my recently acquired rescue who isn't feeling well. Pizza would just make this day better, been up since 5am taking care of a sic puppy.
179	False	a	I sprained my ankle (I have repeated problems with this ankle from a previous injury) and then I had to work at a cafe all day because it was my first day and I've been unemployed for a month so I can't afford to lose this new job that I finally found (I've been cleaning houses sporadically since I moved back to the city, and just scraping by). On top of that I passed my first kidney stone recently and I'm having landlord issues. I'm trying to stay optimistic but I just feel like I can't get a break lately.
180	False	a	Never got to as a kid. Immigrant parents so we always stayed to basic veg. (my parents were muslims so I wasn't allowed any pork either).   I discovered bacon in all it's glory. Now I love bacon, pepperoni and ham. It always smelled bad to me as a kid but now smells glorious...   Kinda lost track. Anyway yeah, always wanted to try the cheese stuffed pizza. 
181	False	a	My roommate's wife is gone for the first time and their infant son will not take the bottle.  He's been screaming for the last hour, and neither of us have the wherewithal to cook or the cash for delivery.  Please help.  Edit: Withdrawn!  My friend is cooking dinner for us.
182	False	a	Anyone wanna buy a guy some pizza from down under i am close to Sydney need your help hungry now!!!!!
183	False	a	I got a coupon in the mail last time I ordered from Dominos for a free medium pizza next time I place an order. Well today's the last day it's valid and I am completely busted. Would anyone please be kind enough to float me a gift card to Dominos so I can get something to eat and get to use my coupon? It seems like a shame to let it go to waste. If you can  hook me up than thank you, if not its but it's not the end of the world. Thanks Random Acters.
184	True	a	I posted a long while back for a pizza and thankfully I got one from a great guy who really helped me out. I wanted to give a pizza back but I still haven't found a job. Any help would be great. sorry for another sob story, i know they get old
185	True	a	I'm at home, in between work earlier and work later, drinking some beer, and have no pizza to go with it. I am very sad. I read the sidebar, too, but I don't know if I am doing the steps right because there are a lot of words over there.   When I get home from work later, I'll probably buy a pizza for a nice hungry person though. Pizza for me now, pizza for you later.  Here is me with my beer: http://i.imgur.com/A6n1k.jpg  Here is me without pizza: http://i.imgur.com/vMOYJ.jpg
186	False	a	well i decided to ask one of my friends, and he was nice enough to get me pIzza tonight :)  I could still use an E-card though, i ate all of the Domino's artisian with spiniach and feta yumm..  but that or pizza hut one is good for me.   
187	False	a	You would make me a very happy person.
188	False	a	I wont see my first cheque for another month (I am low on funds in mye bank account) so my parents as nice as they are have footed my rent bill (1 month), I know i'll be running out of groceries soon. Pizza is my favorite food and It could easily push a few more days untill I need to start dipping into my near empty bank account for new groceries, which will def. be canned goods. 
189	True	a	Hey RAOP! It's lunch time and I'm hungry.  I have 2 bucks in my bank account but I have the feeling that is going to go to gas so I can get to my new gig on Friday.  I have some vegetable soup, and a can of tuna, and some chocolate chips(?), so its not like I'll starve to death or anything.  I'm just a guy who loves pizza.  I love smelling it, looking at it, eating it, eating it when its cold, eating after heating it up in the toaster oven again so it gets nice and crispy... mmmm...  no expectations, I'll delete this in 2 hours or so if i need to [edit: i won't delete this, apparently that is a bannable offense!].  Thanks everybody, keep up the good work!  EDIT:  Thanks to SarTim I am happy as can be! thanks for reading everybody, and keep up the good work here on RAOP!  
190	True	a	I don't have a sob story or any of that kind of stuff people usually have around here. I'll be honest. I couldn't save any money for food since Christmas is around the corner and we all know that means gifts for all... Including rent. Sigh.   I would really appreciate the help if someone could lend a hand. I get paid tomorrow so I can repay it forward to someone here in need just as I am today.   Any Aussies can lend a hand? :S
191	False	a	So, yeah, as the title reads, I've had one hell of a week.  I had a job as a clerical assistant in the East Hartford area for about 2 months, essentially doing scrub work, and thought everything was going well, until out of the blue on Tuesday, they fired me without a real reason.  I've since been on a few job interviews, but this economy is killing everything up here, and I'm getting scared.  As a cherry on top of my already wonderful week, my girlfriend of 2 1/2 years left me, saying we've been moving in separate directions for some time now.  I think this is code for she's been fucking everyone in town behind my back, but who knows.  So Reddit, I come to you on my knees, looking for a little help.  I know how sad and pathetic it sounds, but a pizza would help erase the memory of this week, but I just don't have the means to go out and buy one now, since I'm unemployed, paying both sides of my rent, utilities and misc. expenses. 
192	False	a	On sunday, my boss called me saying that he just received a letter from the city stating that he does not have the right building permits to do deliveries (public bathroom, tables, etc). So I got laid off. He offered my job but it was during the times when I'm in school so I couldn't take it.  Afterwards I was glad I had another 2 other jobs to fall back on at school. The next day I went and talked to both teachers about the jobs, both hired me for another semester. The I go to the work study off and it turns out that wasn't the case. I had lost my work study job due to my school's budget being cut.   At least school was paid off with some money leftover for me to live off of along with the money I saved up from working. I know it will be hard for me to find a job since I am in school full time. Some free pizza would at least put a smile on my face (and some of my unemployed friends' faces as well) after this, along with saving me some money.  If it helps, I have done the past 3 gift exchanges all with at least one rematch. Feel free to check that out. Maybe that will help my Karma for this one. http://redditgifts.com/profiles/view/Kaidenshiba/  location- St. Louis, MO, USA
193	False	a	My friend I think deserves a RAOP. No need to say exact reasons, but this would certainly make him feel a whole lot better. Thanks everyone. 
194	False	a	Hi my name is Asia. I'm that kind of starving artist college student but I want to give you something in return for you helping me out.  I do makeup design, costume design and drawing! I'd like to draw you whatever you want in whatever style so here are some samples.  P.S I specialize in fan art and Adventure Time cartoon styles. But I also do realism and ink work.  [ART](http://imgur.com/a/hyujm) 
195	False	a	Really craving some pizza would greatly appreciate a yummy one.. and will return a pizza to some one else asap... we just moved and got settled in and I work all week we want to have a family day chilling in our new apartment relaxing.. 
196	False	a	My husband was laid off 2 months ago, the money finally ran out, even after eating one meal a day. We have a beautiful son born on July 30, WIC covers his formula but mommy and daddy can't eat until daddy gets a new job, and no one is calling either of us back for interviews. Got a letter today that SSI has reduced my payments to 0.00, even though we're broke, and now we can't make rent tomorrow. We could really use a good last meal in our home, I know this is my first post, but I saw this site on the news a while back and never felt like i deserved it as much as some of these other people, but then again I never thought we'd end up at the point we are now. I can provide more details if you don't believe me, but I would be eternal grateful to whoever would be willing to grant us this wish. Bless you. 
197	False	a	~~I'll just be honest - It's Saturday night and me and friends want some pizza. We're broke Italian teenagers with nothing to eat. It would be greatly appreciated if someone hooked us up with some za.~~  It was worth a drunk try.
198	False	a	[This posting](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/iad11/what_can_i_do_to_survive_really_strapped_for_cash/) by redditor katehawk910 makes it sound like his/her situation could use some pizza lovin' to alleviate the money he/she would have to spend on food. I'm at work at the moment, are there any other redditors who would be able to help this person out?
199	False	a	Hey guys, I'm a college student in Richmond and it's a couple days before I move into my new place. I'm trying to save up money so I can be independent from my parents, who haven't really offered support unless they can use it to their advantage... Anyway, a pizza my way would be much appreciated, and once I start my full time job I'll try to pay it forward.  Thanks!
200	False	a	I am one of the few that can say I bought at a house at the age o 20.  With this, I found comes many, many extra bills I never thought of.  Food doesn't always come first, and I'm pretty broke right now, and would appreciate anyone willing to send a pizza my way.  Nothing major is required or asked for.
201	True	a	Title says it all. Just got out of class and I want nothing more than a pizza while doing homework and studying. I have ten bucks to my name which is going to have to go to gas in order for me to get to and from campus. I do have a gig (freelance video guy, here) next week that I'll more than happily use the cash from to pay it forward.
202	False	a	Student in a lot of debt, would prefer not to add another $10 for pizza to that pile. I just have 1 more month to go until I can defend my thesis... I've written 200 pages and have about 50 more to go. Once I defend and get a job, I'll become a pizza-giver: I'll give out 2 pizzas for every pizza I've gotten as a student!
203	False	a	I have a starbucks gift card for $15 that I can send to someone via an e-gift through email on the starbucks website in exchange for you buying me a pizza.
204	False	a	My husband &amp; I have been living with family until our new place was ready for us to move in. After NIPSCO, water, moving trucks, storage bill, we are completely tapped out. We sent our two year old to my dad's since we didn't have much in the way of food. I don't get know when the food pantry is open around here, or else I would be there! Not too proud for that. We were just laying around, listing what food would hit the spot!
205	True	a	Im a student staying at home most of the time with a sick father. Is anyone able to buy us a pizza for tonight? Would really lighten up the mood around here!!!  cheers  edit: someone was already supposed to buy me one today but had problems from Europe and no longer could today. Would appreciate it if anyone could help me out.
206	False	a	Im in a hard spot used up all of my last paycheck on bills and have less than two [dollars] (http://imgur.com/nP2kmrs) for these next 5 days had to use the last of my money for gas. Pizza from anywhere would be appreciated thank you &gt;.&lt;
207	False	a	My daughter came home with an awesome report card and I'd love to take her to Westshore Pizza in Tampa for dinner tonight.  Will gladly pay it forward next month when I have some extra cash.
208	True	a	Hey reddit,  I'm; not gonna bore everyone with my sob story, but it's been a long hard road to find and get a job in this economy, and I couldn't be happier,  Sadly, my food supplies have run out for the rest of the week, and wondered if someone had it in their soul to help a guy about to turn his life around.  I'll be back on here ASAP to pay it forward when I can.
209	False	a	Hello, we dropped everthing on 10/20/11 and used my unemployment check to drive 18 hours to help her. We left 2 kids and a dog home and brought the youngest with us. We did bring 2 hamburger and lots of boxed Mac and cheese and potatos, we have used up the small amount of money we had, and the next check, well that will be paying for car insurance, and then I hope the 3rd check will put gas in car to go home.  And we could really use  a hot and cheeseie pizza!! It would be AWESOME !!!   We r in Wilmington Deleware. And when I get back home to fl and get back on track I will defenatly pay it forward! 
210	True	a	I can't find it in me to use my normal account, so this is a throwaway;   long story short, my boss was upset at something I did and thus i'm unemployed for the time being; my kids are hungry and all I ask is for them to be fed. i don't need any food, just my kids. if anyone could help, i'd be grateful. thanks :)  the nearest food pantry is too far for us, my insurance has expired and i can't risk the drive
211	False	a	I am exhausted after work, and hungry, however, I spent the last of my money buying Reddit gold for people the other night. That's my own fault though. Anyways, if you're in a pizza giving mood, I'm in a pizza receiving mood. Also, does anyone know how to make an X-mas present seamless when wrapping it? It keeps buckling..  Edit: Don't need it anymore! Roommate came home with that Little Caesars! 
212	True	a	hi my name is Jessica im 21 curreny living with my mom who is unemployed. I work 20 hours a week at a minimum wage job trying to support us both. I was wondering if I could possibly please have a pizza to just try and forget about all the drama with money and enjoy a nice meal with my mom. I can do the verification system if needed! Its not a dire need just a want. Please it would mean Alot to us
213	False	a	Hey RAOP, I've been suspended from work for about two weeks now due to a damage claim and corp. policy and just stretching my savings out to it's breaking point. Anyway some kind person can send a pizza my way?
214	False	a	I don't really know how to go about saying this but life has been hard for the last couple years what with poor economy, and even poorer job placement, I haven't enjoyed the simple taste of meat and cheese mixed together with sauce and carbs in almost a year. Life really hasn't been right after the military fucked me over for health problems that they caused during service, so if there are any redditor out there with a heart right now, I'm tired of PBJ and just want some good pizza. If no response, I understand.
215	False	a	I wanna do something special for him to cheer him up, but have no money to my name. The best way to cheer him up has always been a quiet night in with movies, board games, and some delivery. I'm unemployed and going to school full-time, so all my money has gone to bills. We also only have some quinoa, eggs, and celery for today's food. I can't drive, and he's so sick he doesn't wanna leave the house to pick more food up. I'd like to let him stay in for the day while still having yummy food to cheer him up!  I will absolutely pay it forward (or request whatever you like from me!) as soon as it's a financial possibility for me!  Also, not sure if it's important (never requested before, sorry if I messed this up) but Dominos is the only chain that will deliver to us.  Thanks! :)
216	True	a	So... I don't really know how to request pizza, especially since what I have to ask for probably makes me sound really... un-needy. I'm 24, flew myself out to Columbus Ohio to work with Cirque Du Soleil temporarily and only work four hours a day and we haven't gotten paid yet. I'm down to $100 and I use most of that to help get me to and from the Cirque site and I haven't eaten anything except some Bananas since yesterday.   It's hard to ask for help, since I put myself here because I want to one day work for Cirque Du Soleil -- instead of just a temporary job working with a show while they are in a city. I plan on trying to follow them for a few more shows and hope the experience helps set my resume apart, as well as that I can practice some aerial arts (trapeze).  I absolutely love the show and the people I am following and it's really the show I want to work for but if I were to actually land a job with Cirque, I honestly would not mind any show.  Regardless, gluten makes me very sick so pizza typically isn't something I can get unless I order multiple little domino's gluten free pizza. I don't really know who else delivers in the downtown columbus area that has gluten free, and also since it's 1am.  I don't expect pizza, since GF is such a hassle but thank you for having a subreddit like this exist. 
217	True	a	Today is going to be a very long day at work and I am not sure I will be able to leave to get lunch.... does someone want to send me a cheese pizza :)
218	False	a	I have to spend my night studying calculus, it's either ramen noodles or pizza, I am hoping for pizza. (Chicago)
219	False	a	Hiya, this is for my friend, not me. She's a freelance makeup artist juggling several part-time gigs and school and she's been having a hard time making ends meet lately. She had an especially shitty day today and I'd love to send her a pizza to cheer her up, but I'm currently unemployed (yay) so I thought maybe Reddit could help me.  **Edit: Oooops, she recently moved to Long Island; I forgot.**
220	False	a	so. not gonna lie. I've put myself in a bad spot through a combination of bad planning bad, decision-making, and bad luck. Im out of food and currently unemployed. a pizza would be nice instead of ramen. you know how it is, bland food for so long and your just aching for something with flavor. helps keep me from going nuts. my cash is going straight to my rent payment that im really late on. hopefully temp assitance doesn't drag their feet much longer.   also. selling a bunch of stuff to pay bills. comment if interested. will provide pics and stuff. 
221	False	a	I am a  broke student at the University of Oregon sitting in my inferno of a house. It's 91 degrees today, which might not seem drastic to many, but it's the hottest day since I have been at school and there is no way we have air conditioning, let alone more than one small fan. Pizza would be greatly appreciated, prevent myself from venturing into the humid warzone that is the outdoors.  
222	False	a	I am getting incredibly tired of rice-gruel for every meal (and a bit low on rice). Payday is a ways away. How can I beg/barter/steal my way into your hearts for a little slice of paradise?
223	False	a	We are in Austin TX and are currently living on 3 eggs and 7 packs on ramen.
224	True	a	At this point austerity measures have been enacted weeks ago. I've been learning to cook cheap plentiful stables, like rice, rice, and also rice. Loan disbursement was supposed to kick off yesterday but after consulting with my massively inept financial aid office it seems that my loan has been lost in the aether. I'm a little dizzy and a lot pissed off and a hot delicious pizza would do wonders for my mood.  Would anyone kindly help me out?
225	False	a	Fucked up on my last post so apologies for that. But I have [this] (http://i.imgur.com/7MuMBND.jpg) Texas Chainsaw Massacre poster I did awhile back but I'm starving right now so thought I'd offer a trade! This 20x30 in. poster for some pizza? :D   Currently in California  Edit (for the mods): Sorry for the mixup! wont happen again.
226	False	a	I'm hungry got no food will trade portal 2 coupoun for pizza we have a papa johns in town please raop help me
227	False	a	I finally got back on my feet and got a place to live. The only thing is, I would sort of love a pizza just for the hell of it! I have food, but I can't afford eating out. I'm just here hoping. Thanks for reading!
228	False	a	I tried everything before coming here, and I still feel bad for doing this, but I came here to beg for food. I'm a (forgive the clich√©) poor college student. Every food service location on campus is closed (and even so, I only have $3 left for food), and I have no money in my bank account. I really just need something to eat before I head home in the morning. I can't really offer anything, but what I can do is promise to pay it forward.  **TL;DR:** I really just need one more meal before tomorrow.  I'll certainly pay it forward ASAP.  Thank you for your generosity!
229	True	a	after couch surfing for months, going through job loss and rejections, bank trouble, college loans, unreliable friends, my girlfriend and I finally got enough money to pay for a lease on an apartment. I just spent the last 2 days both studying for the biggest final of my life and lugging furniture up three flights of stairs until two in the morning. I just took my exam and i nailed it thank god, however i don't have any money for lunch for the next week. i was hoping that someone would be kind enough to get one for me..this has been a 6 month struggle that has finally come together.
230	True	a	I'm a 22 year old student out of Topeka, KS, majoring in accounting and finance. I am currently on the hunt for a 2nd job that'll pay for tuition, books, and the other expenses life presents me. As my current job barely covers rent and utilities, food has kinda taken a back seat for me. I know I'm new on here, but I have been a long time member on other web sites like Slickdeals.net, which showed me how to save money on groceries thru Amazon.  I am hitting up a temp agency today to see if I can find an immediate solution to my money quandaries. If I am successful in supplementing my income, I will gladly return to do my part in keeping the wheel of Pizza graciousness spinning. My birthday is coming up on the 14th of July, and I have always felt more comfortable with giving than receiving on my special day. Like a hobbit.  It would be such a blessing to not have to worry about where my next couple meals are coming from.
231	False	a	[US] ohio
232	False	a	We could just really go for some pizza right now. Obviously, we are super broke. Although it's irrelevant, it's 23 degrees outside.  
233	True	a	My stomach is hurting and there is nothing in my fridge to eat unfortunately :-/ I will provide pics of said fridge lol. I would be forever grateful if someone could help out, and I would pay it forward in the future when i'm in a better situation.
234	False	a	So I'm pretty broke this month and just heard from work that I wont be needed for a few weeks meaning that I don't have any money coming in for a while. I heard this after getting back from a full day in uni and with a few hours of reading to do tonight so I would really appreciate some pizza. In return I will pay the favour forward when I get money again and send the redditor who makes me smile a story of some kind or photos of me looking happy :) please help me random knights of the internet.  EDIT: location is uk
235	True	a	"I'm currently in debt of a rather severe nature, nothing in my kitchen except some Del Taco hot sauce and tortillas, and that's what I've been surviving off of. I have a pen and pad, ""will art 4 pizza.""  xposted from other RAOP."
236	False	a	im all out of money, i had an A/C Compressor in the car blow up and and since its one of those stupid engines that cant have it disengaged it almost destroyed my entire engine. at least that's what the mechanic said. so if anyone in the GTA area, Canada that can offer up some help ill pay it forward once i get paid in 72 hours.
237	True	a	Graduated and I've yet to find a job but prospects look better now. Still unemployed and just got a letter saying my internet and phone service will be shut off soon. was hoping a kind redditor could help me out with a pizza and something sweet for dinner. 
238	False	a	I don't have a big long sob story, but I do owe a friend a bit of money for helping me with food a little bit back, and since I found this, what better a way to do it?
239	False	a	So my coworker's lunch got stolen. I felt bad for him since it had happened to me before (we work in a fairly big building with lots of strangers coming though so theft happens). I offered to help him get another one and even to go pick it up for him. Apparently this is tantamount to admission of guilt? Next thing i know I'm being accused of being the dastardly pizza thief.    I haven't even had pizza in ages, but if anyone has a spare pie id love to be caught with some evidence. :3
240	True	a	"Okey Dokey... I requested a Pizza yesterday on account of being out of food. I did ask kind of late and did not get said pizza, my bad. I did not, however, go to bed hungry. It dawned on me that I had all the stuff for vegan fudge, I'm not vegan, or vegetarian, but I am pretty clever. Here's what I had for dinner.       3 cups sugar      1 1/2 cups water (use coconut, almond, or regular milk if you've got it)      2/3 cups of coco What you wanna do is boil the shit out of these 3 ingredients until they pass the ""hard ball"" test... What's that you ask? you just drizzle a little bit of the mixture into a bowl of cold water and if you can reach in and form a ball your mixture passed (Test frequently until you have the hang of making fudge)... Once your fudge passes the test turn off the heat and toss in a TSP of Vanilla and a Half a stick of butter if you've got it (I made mine with just sugar water and cocoa last night and it was still good). At this point you can toss stuff in your chocolate goo... Nuts, Raisins, those little cranberry raisin thingies... Ya know whatever, I like to dump a load of peanut butter in there when I have it. Super easy!      Anyway, I would like to eat real food tonight so if you can help out shoot me an email. Otherwise I'm eating fudge again. Could be worse... THANKS GUYS!"
241	False	a	My GF and I of two years just broke up.  I don't feel like cooking or moving but I know that I should eat so I was hoping that someone would throw this bummed out dude a za.  
242	True	a	I will help someone anyone even it doesn't work.   Being hungry is the shittiest feeling of all time.  Update:  Mission Accomplished thanx to Sectorfour  http://i.imgur.com/a1AYp.jpg
243	True	a	My dad has helped me out of so many binds that it's not even funny, so when my car broke down I decided it was time for me to try to handle things on my own. At first it was the inner and outer tie rod, then I had a problem with the fan switch, and now it won't even start. I was trying to do things on my own so my dad would be proud of me for fixing things but I've just managed to screw it all up.   To make a long story short, I have a full tank of gas and I've spent $650 in two weeks trying to get my car running, but it isn't working. I just bought a bus pass to get to work, so I have $3 to my name until Wednesday rolls around, and an empty pantry to keep me company. If a kind stranger was to provide me with a pie, I'll be more than happy to pay back the hungry with my next paycheck.   EDIT: I'm in Columbus, OH  EDIT 2: The pizza arrived! Thanks raavyn! [It was delicious!](http://www.imgur.com/Lkwsk.jpg) Thank you so much! Look forward to helping someone else out!
244	False	a	My University lied and said dining halls would be open all break. As soon as break started they changed the schedules so now they are closed until tomorrow. My roommate and I have run out of food for the weekend and could really use some pizza :C I don't get paid till the 30th and will gladly return that favor :D
245	False	a	Payday isn't til next week and when we couldn't get a pizza for my birthday a few days ago he scrapped together the money. Now he is craving a stuffed crust pizza and I can't even scrape together the money to get it for him and the kids...My 10 year old has even offered her $2 she has :( Help! Please!
246	False	a	Hello,  We just got done moving our older brothers and their children in with us, we used to be a family of 4 but we have grown it seems overnight.  We just moved into a bigger home to accommodate everyone here but now we have nothing left for food until Thursday night.  I understand that there are many on here who need this more then my family and if you overlook us to give to them, then God bless you.  But if anyone out there wants to throw us a pizza lifeline this evening it would be most appreciated. 
247	False	a	In addition to that, I've been wondering for a while how this works. Figured my birthday might be a good a time as any to try it. I'll be sure to pay it forward though!  PS: I can also write poetry if someone is interested. Or music. 
248	False	a	lost job  starting new one  soon  but  need   somthing for now intill i  get money in a day  or so   live in waynesburg PA 
249	False	a	Long story short my work hasn't paid me for a fortnights worth of 12hour shifts (12 days on 2 off... It's been painful), I'm a little over $800 in the red freaking out about my car repayments, rent and everything else in between... I could really use a pizza to check off where the hell food for the day will come from, and come pay day (if it ever comes) will most definitely send on the pizza.  More than happy to verify anything, happy if nothing happens as at least I've finally used my reddit account.
250	False	a	I was just wondering if anyone could help me out, my mother in law and fiance are stuck at home with nothing to eat and it just breaks my heart that not even her boyfriend will do anything about it. Please help thank you
251	False	a	"Basically, my pregnant girlfriend and I have been getting screwed over by a friend that owes us money. He was supposed to pay us the day after last pay day, but didn't.       For the last week we've been stuck splitting a 6"" Subway sub every day (She gets a free 6"" for working there). A pizza would be very much so appreciated, by me, and I'm sure it'd make a craving packed soon to be mommy very happy as well.       Regardless of if anyone helps us out or not, I'll be sending a pizza someone's way when I get paid.    Thanks for reading guys.  -Shane"
252	False	a	I have one cup of ramen left, and I don't get paid until next wednesday. Could really use some pizza to last. Will pay it forward in the future :)
253	False	a	From Miami, I know not too far, but had to come to Orlando for a certification course. Put hotel money and course money up front and will be reimbursed by my company either this week or next but all the expenses broke me and I left my emergency credit card at home. Anything would help and would definitely pay it forward in the coming weeks. Thanks! 
254	False	a	Anybody in the Belmont/Rockford, Michigan area able to send a pizza to an employee of mine? We have been really slow at work and he's a technician of ours and works as a contractor. We haven't been able to give him any jobs because we've been so miserably slow so we can't afford to pay him. His son's birthday was yesterday and he was going to get his son from his ex-wife today and hang out with him for the day. We were supposed to be able to pay him today but the funds didn't come through from DISH Network (we install DISH) and we won't have money for him until Tuesday. Was wondering if anyone would want to send a pizza his way? Just thought I'd try.
255	False	a	Thanks to security deposits and two month's rent and hiring movers, I have absolutely no food and no money to last me until I move at the end of the week.   I would be super appreciative if someone would be willing to hook me up with a pizza, which would feed me for at least 2-3 days. I have every intention of returning the favor when I get paid on the 31st.
256	True	a	Mommy's at work so me and my son are stuck hanging around the house watching DVD's tonight. we're pretty low on food till Thursday. Save us from going three nights in a row of Mac N Cheese!  (halfway through season 1 of Big Love, then were going to watch some Mad Men)
257	False	a	My gf of 4 years and I just broke up and i'm trying to do any random thing that might help slowly fill the void. Unfortunately I was unprepared for this and it has cost me quite a bit already. If someone could get me even just a small pizza to munch on while I continue to pack up her things from my room, i'd be eternally grateful and return the favor to either you or some other unlucky pizza redditor come pay day.
258	False	a	Just got my first job out of college and it's actually out of the country (Brazil). It actually starts in October so still a bit of time to wait. Just need to get the specific type of Visa required etc. Anyway I want to celebrate but lack the funds. A pizza would be great! In the DC Area.  Edit: Got the pizza, thanks quiethero!
259	False	a	Hi, thanks for reading. My husband and I just have had to close our company down due to the economy and to be honest we are barely making it by on Public Assistance for the first time ever. We have 4 great kids who have made the best out of a kind of bummer summer and we would love to surprise them with Pizza and a movie. It would be great as the summer is coming to an end and would love a night of smiles. Thanks again for reading.
260	False	a	I dont have to much cash to go out and get something to eat and the fridge is bare since I dont go food shopping until tomorrow. If someone wants to help, you would have my love and gratitude. Thank you!
261	False	a	Title pretty much says it all. I'd like not to disappoint them, so I was hoping someone could help. I can pay it back later next month.
262	False	a	Thank you in advance to the kind soul who might hopefully buy us a pizza. 
263	False	a	No sob stories, just college apps kicking my ass. Procrastination is my best friend, we have a lot of fun then I remember all the stuff (COLLEGE APPS) I SHOULD have been doing. So, now that I'm pulling an all nighter a snack, preferably a pizza would be sick! :] IN CA. 
264	False	a	haven't had stuffed crust pizza in ages and after paying rent, car insurance, and paying off my credit card i don't have tons of money available for such luxuries.  i have a verification code, so if you feel like being generous i can send that to you.  thanks!
265	False	a	"College student waiting for some eBay money to post to my account, but at the moment this is all I have left.  PLEASE DON""T MAKE ME EAT IT.  http://www.imgur.com/VAb6QLm.jpeg"
266	False	a	hey, my sister just turned 15 and her birthday didnt really go so well and was upset, it would be great if you guys sent her a pizza to cheer her up, and knowing it came from a reddit user would be even greater :D
267	False	a	Greetings. My name is Melanie, and I'm 28 year old fighting Stage 2 Hodgkins Disease. I'm nearing the halfway point in my treatment. I go for chemotherapy every 2 weeks on a Thursday. I spend the weekend sleeping, and my appetite comes back by Monday or Tuesday.  One of the worst sides effects at that point is a nauseous taste in the back of my throat and strong tastes help me cope. Domino's Memphis BBQ Pizza has a strong taste that gives me some relief, and is also the idea balance of high protein/high calorie that my doctors want me to have. I'd really love to have that strong taste when I'm feeling the nausea. This is an ongoing post since every 2 weeks it would be helpful. Thank you for your help. 
268	False	a	im home alone in the basement and i am sick and tired of having to sleep with my grandma cause she smells cause im too tired to change her diaper after my 4 hour shift at blockbuster. And to top it all off i just ran out of kitty litter. So my house smells like poo. I also was just declined to be on the show hoarders because they said just because theres shit all over my house doesnt mean im a hoarder. I just wanna smell pizza for once, not shit.
269	False	a	I would love a pizza!
270	False	a	Hi guys!   I'm a student,  typically strapped for cash, and thought I'd give this a go. Me and my girlfriend would love a pizza but we're a bit down on funds.   Will return the favour when I next get paid,  or my student loan comes through! Will also do anything in return like draw a picture,  or anything. :D   In Stoke, UK. 
271	False	a	Help me RAOP and I will return the favor on payday!!!
272	False	a	I don't have diablo 3 yet but when it finally gets delivered i will give you the guest code, if for some reason it doesn't have a guest code i will give you something else.
273	True	a	Times have been tough lately, I'll spare the details, but there is a few other posts I have made in r/assistance and r/loans recently.  Long story short, I'm getting pretty sick of eating ramen and will continue to do so for about 2 more weeks, because, well, that's all I have.  I will gladly pay-it-forward in about a month or so.  Thanks for reading.
274	True	a	Not gonna post a sob story, me and my husband are just getting pretty tired of plain rice and frozen burritos. Help us have a tasty dinner and we will give the gift of pizza to someone in a week when we get paid. 
275	False	a	"Mom decided to ditch us to get her nails done and hit up a bar, she left us pancakes for breakfast and nothing for lunch and dinner God knows when she'll be back. Tried texting our dad but he responded with ""Busy at work"". Our fridge has some stuff in it but nothing really edible by itself sadly. No other options left except ask the RAOP community! Help us RAOP you're our only hope! ( It's my first time on Random Acts of Pizza please be gentle =D )"
276	True	a	She lives in Round Lake Beach, Illinois, which hasn't been hit super hard by the recession but certainly isn't doing well. She works as a waitress for a restaurant that just opened, and it's not doing too well. It's looking like she's gonna be unemployed soon. She's down to a day a week, and unfortunately I'm not in a position to help her out with food. A random pizza will help her eat something other than the stale remains of a box of wheat thins til her boyfriend gets back home to her on Monday.  EDIT: Thank you so much, Reddit. You made her week for sure!
277	False	a	This month's been a little tough, and pretty much been relegated to ramen for the past week. If some kind person wishes to help break the monotony, that'd be awesome. 
278	False	a	My mother lives in the area effected by the giant little bear fire in New mexico and is waiting to hear if she has a place to live or is coming back to New York to live with me. My father lost his job several month ago and is also likely about to move in with me. These two have been divorced for 20+ years and as much as i love them I have no idea if I can handle that. So I'm sitting here stressed out already wondering if I have enough to survive this economic hellstorm myself, let alone save my parents. I would love a pizza right now.
279	True	a	Edit: iEatPie got me.  
280	True	a	I will send an offer on friday to return the favor and keep it going.
281	False	a	I have posted this in what I thought was this subreddit, but it seemed to be an offshoot that's not active (?) it's also at r/randomactsofpizza  if one gets fullfilled i'll make sure to notifiy the other subreddit. I'm in need to last me the next few days.  If I've done anything wrong let me know.  EDIT: If need be, I can and will write a poem about anything you ask.
282	False	a	Hey reddit,   My fiance and I recently sold everything we own and bought an rv so that we at least had a place to live. unfortunately that left us with no funds for anything else, and just like a champ our RV broke down. So, we are currently on the side of the road, in front of a friend's house. It would be really awesome to have a pizza to eat ourselves, but I would really like to have something to offer the household. We don't get our food stamps until the 9th, and just though that maybe reddit could come through in a pinch.   Thanks everyone!   P.S. I'm using my dad's old account so that i wouldn't be on a *new one     
283	False	a	I am a graphic artist (3rd year in college) and I will do a graphic of any kind (logo for your Facebook page, TV show themed graphic, graphic of your favorite thing, repair a picture with Photoshop)  Here are some examples of my work:  [One] (http://imgur.com/lxNCsuS) [Two]  (http://imgur.com/q3PEtwm) [Three](http://imgur.com/VGGzkbE) [Four] (http://imgur.com/ZLfaNi8) [Five] (http://i.imgur.com/5lGYNucs.jpg) [Six] (http://imgur.com/iNbLAMf) [Seven] (http://imgur.com/cdJ4mVe) [Eight] (http://imgur.com/gaKtm1V) [Nine] (http://imgur.com/9KjM4n3)   &lt;3
284	True	a	So I just graduated 2 days ago, and I have paid rent, graduation fees and have even had to use every dime of my graduation money to get moved. Now I've come to the middle of the week, no money and extremely hungry. Help a guy out? Willing to offer graphic design/advertising consulting! Or a copy of Dota 2! 
285	False	a	Hello I  am a 20 year old male living far away from away from all family. My car was towed twice this month, thoroughly draining my account and rent money. And to top it off, now my car won't even start and my foodstamps were unexpectedly cut off :/ Things are rough and I humbly ask for my favorite food, Pizza Hut. Id love to share a pie with my friends this week, theyve helped me so much and i wanna show them I appreciate them. :)
286	False	a	Student living in waterloo, ontario. Sometimes all one needs to feel better in a time like this, is just drown your sorrows in a greasy pizza. Thanks
287	False	a	If anyone could spare a papa john code or wanna trade for amazon lemme know.
288	False	a	totally craving a stuffed crust, not expecting at all, just would be nice since I am currently unemployed
289	True	a	All I have at home is a loaf of bread, since I was on vacation when the accident happened (as typical in Michigan, a deer decided to do a few cartwheels over the two-week old car).  Luckily insurance is covering the car, but since I don't have a credit/debit card, I had to pay the deposit in cash, depleting all my money until Friday when I get paid again. To make matters worse, the rental car they gave me is a baby blue Nissan Versa, which is embarrassing as hell to drive.  I am in Grand Haven, MI and was wondering if there was any way I could get just a basic pepperoni pizza.  The only chain places are Jets, Pizza Hut, and Dominoes (and Dominoes last I knew used one of those carbon copy things the driver carried for the CC since they demand the person with the card to be here).  I WILL pay it forward after I get paid on Friday.  I am just slightly sick of having toast and butter the past two days...
290	False	a	Any help at all would really make this day seem less shitty than it really is. Thanks
291	False	a	Not exactly urgent, but my oven is currently broken and I don't have anything to eat that I do not have to cook somehow. Pizza sounds great tonight, but my bank account is drained (damn cell phone bills!). I will pay it forward at some point if someone buys. There are others more needy than I am though so if you feel someone else needs it more (i.e. families), please do it for them instead. Just thought I'd post this on here in case anyone was feeling generous.
292	True	a	While I do love ramen, its all I have eaten for almost 2 weeks and it will be another 2 weeks till I actually have money that doesn't go directly into gas to get to school (100 a week on gas just to get to school) I don't feel like I can stomach another bowl right now, regardless of how much hot sauce I use. Please help me! I have a Dominos and Papa Johns in walking distance of my house. In return thanks and pictures. When I can I will pay it forward. 
293	False	a	Hey.  We don't have any power and could really use a pizza.  Much thanks.
294	False	a	I've been working at an awesome internship in Hollywood this summer, and I think it would be great if I could get a large cheese pizza for my boss as thanks. The other intern and I already have a card and simple gift for him. Would anyone be kind enough to help out and make our last day (8/12) really awesome?  *Edit:* We'll take pics of us eating the pizza!
295	False	a	Edit: never mind - managed to find some spare change and buy a packet of dried spaghetti from the local corner shop.  Don't really have much to say apart from the above. It's 8:15pm in London and I literally haven't eaten anything all day. I have a jar of mustard in the fridge and that's it.  My flatmates are on holiday, and my friends and family are all far away. If anyone can gift me a pizza it'll make a huge difference. I'll have a couple of slices now and the rest should tide me over for tomorrow. I have some money from contract work hopefully (*fingers crossed*) coming in next week.  Thanks for reading, even if you don't send me a pizza. It feels good to share.  Edit: My brother gave me a Steam code for Bastion a couple of months ago. I haven't used it yet and I'll happily trade it for a pizza.
296	False	a	"So, tonight I'm staying in and writing a term paper for the next few days. It's on N. Scott Momaday's ""House Made of Dawn"" if you're curious. I would appreciate some brain food. :)   EDIT: And to make it fun, how about we make it one pepperoni and one with any combination of toppings. Your choice! (Except please no pineapple or fish.)"
297	True	a	I gotta say, I haven't had a pizza in a while, it just isn't in the budget. I'm starving and would &lt;3 you forever if you bought me and my gf a pie :)
298	True	a	Howdy r/RAOP! Just recently moved down to Saint Petersburg here in Florida; job hunting has been pretty rough, and I can think of nothing else but a pizza to really cheer me up and do the trick :)  I promise with my first paycheck to pass the favor on!
299	True	a	I'm working on a mountain in Vail Valley, CO this season, not getting paid very well, and am forced to live on a very tight budget (less than $10 a day). This is a very expensive place to live. I just got my first paycheck and all of it went to the person I am renting from. I am willing to do just about anything (legal) that is requested. I'm very hungry and hoping that someone can help me out! I promise to return the favor when I am able to! Thank you in advance! 
300	True	a	recently i lost my job and my apartment and because i moved to another state i cannot collect unemployment the person i was supposed to move in with backed out after i got here and now i'm stuck in the walmart parking lot with a popped front passenger tire without any money or food i haven't eaten in several days and i have nobody who i can call for help. recently i saw this site by chance and decided that it can't hurt to try. all i need is a little help thank you and god bless
301	False	a	We are some dudes in Norwich, CT studying for various classes and we could use some food. We are college students low on money and hungry for some pizza. 
302	False	a	Just picked up a new job, payday is tomorrow! If someone pizzas me a half off dominos today, I will pizza two people dominos tomorrow. Go!   Located in CT, will pizza two people $20 each, and the half off promo 9143 is in full effect!
303	True	a	I'm watching my grandparent's house for the next few days and I have absolutely NO money and there isn't any food in the house. I've eaten all the cereal and applesauce in the house and would really appreciate it if someone could help me out with a RAOP. I will gladly trade pictures of my cat and/or my nephew for your karma pleasure.   **Chaska/Chanhassen/Eden Prairie-Minnesota**  **EDIT** Once my grandparents pay me I promise to pay it forward/back.
304	False	a	I have a friend who was laid of has no food or resources. I myself have been recently laid off and have no money to send a pizza or anything else.  She is in Omaha, NE., I am in Denver, CO.  Anyone able to help, it would be greatly appreciated!!
305	False	a	"I had a small service going and I would just charge people in paypal for those services. A few weeks later I found out that about half of them end up charging back even though they were all ""satisfied"" with my services.   Now paypal just calls me and I really don't know what to say. I don't have money to negate my - balance and could use a pizza to cheer me up.   Here's a picture of my balance:  http://i.imgur.com/CGthQ.png It was actually 100 something but I manage to win one dispute was too late to reply to another because I didn't check my paypal.  "
306	True	a	Biochemistry is a hell of a major. 
307	False	a	We are both redditors looking for some goodness on a day of tomfoolery.
308	False	a	Hey RAoP, I made a new account as to not alert my redditing (now ex) girlfriend.. I have had just about the shittiest couple weeks and it all started with my beautiful girlfriend of almost three years leaving me and now I don't have anymore money for food until Monday.  I would love it if someone would help a guy who is down on his luck but not going to give up.  She has dreams and aspirations that she didn't think could be fulfilled by being with me so I will now assume the role of the best friend I can be and support/always cheer her on and I hope she does incredible things in this world.  As for me, it's time to re-assess.  Cheers, RAoP
309	False	a	Been living off ramen and beans 'n rice for the past few weeks. Ate my last ramen yesterday for lunch. Don't have much to offer but I'll do what I can to trade.
310	True	a	I don't normally ask for things from people, especially ones I don't know, but this subreddit seems pretty awesome..  My backstory: I'm a 24 year old single dad with full custody of my 5 year old. Things have been really tight for years..pretty much since I graduated high school. I pay for everything on my own and between rent, car payment, utilities, groceries, and a $440 daycare bill every month there isn't much left. His mother chips in $75/month which doesn't even pay for a week of daycare.   Anyway, my son starts elementary school next week and is scared to death. Would love to surprise him with a pizza :]  Since I won't be having that massive daycare bill next month I will gladly pay it forward!
311	True	a	Hello!  I have been considering making a request on here for a while so I decided today that I would actually do it!  This was motivated by paying my rent online today and seeing my bank balance shrink (eep), so having one less dinner to worry about would be really nice.    Right now everything that I am paying is coming out of my student loans since I was unable to find a summer job, and it is stressing me out.  A pizza would just make me feel better!   I will of course try to pay it forward as soon as I can, let's hope that one of these job applications works out~  Thanks for reading, RAOP!
312	False	a	My bf.   He finishes work at 9pm and I think he would be really chuffed if he came home to a RAoP (I think he deserves it). Just thinking about how happy his (rather attractive) face would be is making me smile lots and lots.   He is in love with Reddit forevz and would likely reimburse you with a witty song or nice picture of something bad ass.  Thanks for reading, I hope you might like to help ;)
313	True	a	I'm as broke as I've ever been and hungry. I'm typically the kind of person who tries to help others so I'm pretty sure I'll pay it forward the first chance I get.  *Laid off, foreclosed, evicted but still optimistic.
314	False	a	It would take me like 2 days to transfer to a bank account, and I have no money right now. I'd really appreciate it. Thanks(:
315	False	a	I've been a reddit lurker for years and finally made an account so I could request some sweet sweet pizza! Thanks guys! :)
316	False	a	Hey all,  This is my first time using this and honestly I feel a bit guilty for even requesting after reading some of the stories on here.. Some of you guys are much worse off than I and my heart goes out to you. :(  Nevertheless, this has been the week from hell. I'm sick with the flu, I have an (also sick) 5 month old, lots of exams due, and $5.98 in my bank account (yes, I can take a screen shot and show you if you'd like). I've been too sick (and little one is too sick to be taking to the grocery store!) and too poor to even get adult groceries for myself in a couple of weeks, (but we still have a healthy supply of yummies for the little one, so no worries there! Little ones always come first! &lt;3)  Honestly, I'm just sick, broke, worn out and hungry. I'd be happy to repay the favor. I love helping people out :) So if anyone could find it in their heart to help me out with a pizza or two (yay for maybe having cold pizza breakfast tomorrow too!) I'd be the happiest little camper ever.   &lt;3's!
317	False	a	Hi, to whomever kind soul might be reading this, I am pleading for someone to help/bring a smile to my family. Yesterday, my mother went to the doctor, and her doctor said she has a possible chance of having ovarian tumor. She does not want us to worry but we all know how scared she is. She is the caretaker of the family, and with money being short right now, I know she is stress about having surgery if she does have the ovarian tumor. I do not have any money since I am going to surprise my mother with the money for her to use whatever little money I have given her for the surgery. I am begging a kind soul to possibly donate an ecard for my family so we can have a family meal as well as to let her know that there are people out there who are supporting her. I know there is alot of fraud on this page, but my story is true. Please help my family thank you. 
318	False	a	Basically what the title says. I had a 3 day drill this past weekend and although I ate on base for free, I still had to put in $15 a day to get there and back. Very inconvenient, and the pay for that won't hit my account for 7-11 days. So now I have enough to make it to my day job, but not enough to eat. Any help would be hugely appreciated.  
319	True	a	"Hey all! This is a throwaway, I've been lurking RAOP for quite a while and I'm really inspired by what's been going on, however never though I'd be on here asking.  I'm a student in Seattle and currently I have around 5$ for the next week. I'm looking for someone willing to get me a pizza that will last me the next few days until I get some money.  Edit: It says ""Alone"". I recently moved to Seattle with no friends, and no family.  Edit: That sounds too dismal, it's just boring.  I will return the favor with a pie later on this month. I love everything about RAOP and if someone helps me right now, I'd love to help in the future. I can provide a picture of me Omnoming it when it arrives.  Thanks guys! &lt;3 "
320	False	a	"Im asking for a pizza, not because you should feel sorry for me, but because fun to interact with strangers. Have you ever thought its strange that people think it is ok to ask for money from total strangers but they think it is too much to ask to get into a personal conversation with people who help them? I think most the people here are have good intentions for giving away pizza and dont need to be treated like a stalker or rapist or whatever. Im not going to open up my whole life to you, but I promise more than trivial conversation and interaction.  And I really need this pizza, Im saving for college, Ive been eating really cheap food lately.  I live in Gig Harbor, Washington  The reason I dont have many posts on reddit is that I am not able to access my old account under the name ""arquebus"", it says that no email exists for that name, so I dont know how to get it back. I used to post a lot at www.reddit.com/r/programming/ under that name"
321	False	a	I want a pizza.  My husband hates pizza.  We never eat pizza.  If you buy me one I won't give him any.  Short. Sweet. To the point.  
322	True	a	I'm sure there are needier people on this subreddit, but I had to borrow 30 bucks to pay the rest of my share of rent yesterday and now I'm broke until next friday.  Pizza for me and my housemate that lent me the 30 bucks would be much appreciated for dinner.  Thanks in advance, it's subreddits like this that make Reddit such an awesome place. EDIT:CayucosKid got me covered, 2 pizzas, breadsticks, and a 2 liter of coke to boot!  I'll be eating good for days!  Thanks again.  (=
323	False	a	Pretty pretty please?
324	False	a	We are students struggling to pay rent, and feeling bad eating my girlfriends parents food. It would be awesome to feel like we can relax and just eat some pizza.  If you would like me or my girlfriend to draw you a picture we would be glad to. (She is the better drawer.) if you'd like to see some of her work you can check out her online portfolio [here.](http://www.brookeleighdesign.com/)
325	False	a	So I quit smoking cigarettes today. Been doing fine but I'm really getting hungry and I'm a bit short on funds at the moment so thought I'd give this subreddit a try.
326	False	a	Just an idea but I was wondering if anyone would be interested in ordering pizza's for the paralyzed veterans at the VA in ST Louis? A lot of the patients are older gentleman with no family and some of them end up staying for months or even years. I saw this reddit and recently [posted a story](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/up8ap/then_why_the_hell_did_you_give_it_to_me/c4xdiq2) about my roommate in a different sub, saw this sub and made me thank of him.  I was there for 4 months late last year and Remember the sunday dinners where the worst. If you are interested they eat dinner at 5PM CST, so if we ordered at 4PM it should arrive before they get dinner.  Jefferson Barracks SCI unit, Building 52 , St. Louis, MO 63125   (be sure to put a note to deliver to nurses station and say it's for the vets and nurses if you want, the nurses there are pretty awesome and have a thankless job)  If anyone needs the correct numbers to call, let me know. I just thought they would be pleasantly surprised by a bunch of awesome pizza. There are usually about 18 patients but they upgraded the facility so now there are about twice that. At dinner time there are about 6-8 staff (nurses mostly). Anyways I'm going to order one for them also, I would do more but I'm broke and that's all I can afford :(  Edit: several of the nurses there are redditors, forgot to mention that :)
327	False	a	We are a family of 5 myself , husband and 3 kids.  Craving pizza and inbetween paydays. Can anyone help us out ? Pizza Hut is local but little ceasers, dominoes is pretty close as well but would have to pick up. 
328	False	a	Northern chicago area.
329	False	a	Hi fellow pizza lovers. I stumbled across this subreddit at work today, and holy wow. This is the best thing I've seen in awhile. My boyfriend and I are both government workers who just bought a house. A house, you say! Why, you are a plethora of good tidings and joy! Well, while that is true, we are also supremely poor because of it. We've been saving for a long time to acquire this house, and while it rules, we haven't purchased anything awesome for a long, long time (and will continue on this path until either magic or raises happen. I, personally, have my eyes on magic). Spaghetti (cheapest. food. ever. still delicious. how does it happen?) every night and PB &amp; J every afternoon. I'm not complaining. Definitely used to it at this point. We just miss pizza! We miss it so! Regardless of the outcome of this request, I still think this is the coolest idea in the world, and hope that many might profit from its supreme and magnanimous awesomeness. Oh yeah! We're in Pittsburgh, PA
330	False	a	Hi there, I have this friend, he's my best friend and he's going through a really hard time right now. A pizza would cheer him up a lottttttt C: I was wondering if there would be anything I could do to get him a simple small cheese pizza. I would do it myself, but I'm dirt poor. You can request what you want for thanks, I don't have very much to give. But, it would be nice if he had a smile on his face for a little while. (:   P.S He lives in Thomaston, Connecticut; will anyone help me make him feel better? :3 Please and Thank you &lt;3
331	False	a	i'm a disabled father living on disability and those checks don't go far after bills there is nothing left to treat my family to a dinner out,we haven't had a dinner out for 6 months.i would really like for them to have something different than hotdogs and tuna sandwiche's.please if you could help that would mean the world.thank you,i have a verification code if you need it and my location is conway,south carolina 
332	False	a	My pantry currently contains cereal and canned cream corn. I haven't tried combining the two, but I may have to if this doesn't pan out. I would be forever grateful and willing to pay it forward as soon as my income tax cheque comes in.
333	False	a	So, to keep the sob story short, my paycheck has basically all gone to bills this past week and I won't be getting any money for another two weeks.  I have a box and a half of pasta and some sauce to last me until then, but a pizza would really help.  I know that since I just created a username today most people wouldn't be ready to offer their assistance and that's fine, I understand.  This is sort of a last resort for me anyway.  Verification code: S7bFblS62xYM
334	True	a	Since this is the interwebs and my sincere story could be nothing more than a grand facade to gain free grinds, I can offer nothing more than the hopeful ideation on your part that I am indeed in need of some savory cheesy, saucy laden goodness. I will save my sad-story for my own self when i cry myself to sleep tonight.  It will keep my recently low-spirits to rejuvenate in the fact that the world is not in fact filled with greedy corporate douche-bags who seek to crush me under their boot. Tomorrow is another day, but tonight a pizza will bring me temporary shelter from the bastards who seek to bring me down. or something.  In the hope of oven-baked goodness, I offer these haiku:  &gt; Stomach growling loud   &gt; Oh, Random Acts of Pizza   &gt; Deliver me hope    &gt; ~~Hearken~~ my pizza prayer.   &gt; Praise be to pepperoni!    &gt; Never anchovy!    ps. i'm in Honolulu and Pizza Hut is open late! :)  pss. it appears im a shitty haiku writer. dammit. :(  EDIT: Pizza received! 
335	False	a	Hey r/random_acts_of_pizza, none of my friends wanted to hang out so I'm just drinking by the pool, and would love a pizza zibbity zang to go with this shiner bock pudding pops! A zippity  boo dop
336	False	a	Hey RAOP, we have to white out the walls in our apartment in order to get our security deposit back. We don't have much food or time to cook, and our money is going to rent &amp; utilities. We would love a pizza inbetween coats.  We're in the Western Massachusetts area. Thanks in advance!
337	True	a	The roads were exceptionally frozen this morning after a horrible rain last night. My car slid into someone elses, and caused a lot of damage. I have no collision insurance, thus I will have to pay out of pocket and alas, do not have the means to do so.  My car is now at a shop getting an estimate done, and I am at home with no food and no means to go out and get something hot to eat. Anyone willing to help me out with a pizza? I can surely either pay it back or pay it forward once I am more aware of my financial situation. 
338	False	a	Hello!  Just your average starving comp sci major. I am rather skilled in photoshop and corel draw though, and will draw or shop whatever you like, my dear pizza champion. You want a cool space desktop background? You got it. You want to ponify yourself? I can do that. You want George Washington leading a bunch of space marines? Man you really want me to work for it, don't you? I'll do it!  Thanks for reading.
339	False	a	yeah so I have almost exactly enough money for rent and electric for this coming month. The problem is I don't have money for anything else. My roommate won't buy groceries because he eats at work and I have been two days without real food. It would be nice to be able to have a pizza to call my own 
340	False	a	IDK what to write here.
341	True	a	If someone could hook me up with a $15 gift card I would happily hook someone up with pizza tomorrow. Here is the link to the Papa Johns promotion http://www.papajohns.com/touchdown/  Thanks Reddit! &lt;3
342	False	a	Let me get this straight, I HATE asking for handouts. I hate it. But Im really really sick today, and I don't have anything to eat. If I ended up getting a pizza out of this I swear to god I'd be so happy.  This is also my first time doing this, I don't exactly feel comfortable putting my address in this, but my general area is as follows:  Ottawa, Canada  Orleans,  Chapel Hill  If you're familiar with that suburb, and are feeling generous, message me :)
343	False	a	I can get in my chair for a few minutes to get to the door but not much else. Pretty hungry and when my financial situation is figure out will pay it forward to someone else in need. Verification would be gross but doable. The sore was healed but opened back up recently which is pretty tough to deal with. I am bound to a wheelchair and the wound is on my inner right thigh.
344	False	a	I'm a psychology student that is very short on cash, due to an unexpected expense. My mother is on disability and she could not afford her prescriptions. I ended up paying for her prescriptions, which left me very short on cash. I can provide a receipt of the prescriptions for verification, as well as a copy of my bank statement. It was a tough decision to make, but I know I did the right thing. My mother has sacrificed so much in her life for me that I didn't hesitate when she asked me for help.   I will not get paid again until Wednesday of this week, and one pizza can definitely help me make it until then. I have $2.00 left until pay day. I'm hoping that someone will be able to help me. Thank you. 
345	False	a	Hello, my name is Bret and I'm originally from South Florida, now I reside here in Conyers. I'm here to ask if someone would be decent enough to help me with some dinner tonight or tomorrow while I take care of my kids. I've been separated for nearly ten months now. I drank myself half to death and now I'm working on getting myself back to my feet. I don't have a job and my brother has been paying my rent plus utilities for the last two months. He can't afford to give me anymore cash at he moment, he suggested I try here because you gave him some pizza a while back. I really don't want to feed my kids the same slop I gave them last time. Fish sticks and macaroni, a side of applesauce, they hate it and I practically eat it nightly. I've got two young girls to feed, if someone could help me I'd never forget it. Hopefully that way their mother won't be so hesitant to let them spend the night with me next time they ask to. I'm here if you have any questions or if I left anything out. Hope you'll be well.
346	True	a	i live in New Mexico. Life is pretty good. ups and downs, just like everyone else. i just like pizza, and can't get any. no papa john's in my town though.   Edit: Thanks K-Dawgg!!
347	True	a	"Current situation: So, for the last two weeks, things haven't been so great. Not only have I've been fighting a bad cold for over 3 weeks, my wallet has been stolen, my pet has died, and I was denied a job interview because I'm going to school. For the past 2 to 3 days, I have been eating sparingly out of 4""x7"" box of leftovers from a friend's dinner party.  I hate asking for things, but, I am really hungry. I would greatly appreciate it if someone could help me out. Thank you.  Update: [ActionEra](http://www.reddit.com/user/actionera) saved me!! :D Thank you everybody for reading.

348	False	a	AND we're all poor college students, one pizza would be a perfect end to a shitty day
349	True	a	We are on our honeymoon in Virginia Beach and unfortunately the quality inn we stayed at our first few nights managed to double bill us leaving us broke until tomorrow.  We would love a pizza or really anything we aren't picky.  i will reciprocate once my funds go in if you'd like or simply pay it forward.
350	True	a	yeah, I'm having some bad luck. Kind of hoping for a miracle here. Bare minimum cheese if you're willing. thanks a million.
351	False	a	I just got my money stolen today and that was my money for food the next 2 days that my parenrs are away. can anyone help out with a pizza?          It would be hugely appreciated. (My dog would be very appreciative as well.)  Also, location is The Delaware county area of Pennsylvania.
352	False	a	Unfortunately I only have about $30 to last the week, or else I'd buy everyone pizza myself. I will pay it forward the second I get paid next week!
353	False	a	So I was a bit, over zealous with my black Friday purchases.   I'll be planning to forward a pizza later on once I recover from my purchasing of a new computer &gt;.&lt;
354	False	a	No real sob story; just would love pizza as a reward for surviving my first day back (not to mention that day is 14 hours long).  Cooking later tonight (way later) sounds hellish and I can't afford to eat out or buy my own pizza.  Thank you to anyone who responds; no worries if this doesn't get picked up.
355	False	a	Eat all the pizza!
356	False	a	If someone would like to buy me a pizza I will gladly return the favor friday when I get paid! I just ran out of food and don't want to wait till friday to eat. Thanks for considering!
357	False	a	Pizza-grantors of Reddit: my dad has made himself sick again by working all night long (typical) and my mom (the usual bringer of comfort food in times of trial) is away. I could make some half-assed trader joe's frozen stir fry, but he really loves a good, greasy pizza - which, coincidentally, we can only enjoy in the absence of the matriarch. Repayment will be in the form of one Spenserian Sonnet on the topic of your choice - Spenserian Sonnets being much more complicated and interesting than the boring Shakespeare variety. I am damn good at sonnets, by the way, in case you were wondering. Bonus love for breadsticks. 
358	False	a	I've been out of the country for over a year and a half. Before this time I struggled a lot with depression and it was this friend who helped pull me through! I'm a different person now, and I'd love to sit down over a pizza and catch up!
359	True	a	Hi RAoP  As the title suggests, I have been doing it tough over the last few months.  I am knee deep in debt from being screwed by my partner while trying to start a business.  My current job pays monthly and I am a few days out from being paid but due to some unforeseen vet bills this month, I have found myself without much money or food for the last 2 weeks.   Tonight, I will be having another meal of rice and peas, which I have been surviving on since my cats incident (she is fine now, thankfully) and I am dieing for something nice for a Sunday night.  If there is a kind internet stranger out there who feels like helping someone who has been going through a rough time over the last few months, it would make my entire year!  When I get paid I'll be happy to come visit again to pass the karma on to someone else who needs it.  I live in Australia, if that makes a difference. 
360	False	a	Both of us are college students and he's always hooked it up with a meal or some type of grub when I've been down on cash. Just looking to return the favor as we're both in the shit now. Have to use what little cash I do have left to get me to classes next week. :(
361	True	a	Tomorrow is my first final of finals weeks and I'm already feeling more stressed than anyone should be. These are my last finals ever and I want to finish college on a good note. This semester has given me nothing but a headache. Anyone want to help out a stressed student? I'd be eternally grateful and forever in your debt.
362	False	a	"Hey citizens of Random_Acts_of_Pizza!  NYC-based actor/ retail drone, broke (overdrafted at the moment) until paycheck deposits tomorrow.  Caught a weird head cold this week (better now!) and missed some shifts at work, had some family drama, and dealing with this awful heat and humidity. A sensible pizza could get me fed and happy until I can get paid and to the grocery store tomorrow. I can only eat so much cous cous in one weekend!  I've never posted here before - but I fully intend to ""Pizza-It-Forward"" when I'm back on my feet a bit more.  Happy June, everyone!   EDIT: added some more info!"
363	False	a	Hi guys. My friend posted this is a link to our offer for a pizza in return for a free tshirt (pic in link). We are broke as hell and would love some kind stranger to buy a pizza for us. Even come party with us one night. Please reddit, show us some love.  http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPizza/comments/vuqnx/wroclaw_poland_4_irish_lads_working_for_a/
364	False	a	Been a particularly long day, been up since 4:30 AM and I am just beat. Really can't afford to spend any extra money right now, but a pizza would be really awesome. I will pay it forward on here when I am able to. Just really can't spend any money right now. In terms of places, I haven't lived in this city to long but I know there is a papa johns.
365	False	a	Haven't ate anything but a bowl of cereal for breakfast at 7am this morning before class, and now my laptop is making a very loud screeching sound - probably the fan. Some random pizza would be greatly appreciated to fill an empty stomach.
366	True	a	I would be so eternally grateful if someone would like to order me a pizza! I can provide verification--I am flat ass broke until Friday. Been on a ramen diet for a few days now. On Friday, regardless of whether I get a pizza tonight or not, I will purchase two pizzas for two different people. 
367	False	a	just finished finals and hungry af. just figured i'd give it a shot haha
368	False	a	Just lost my job because of school. Would really appreciate a pizza for my all nighters. Thank you.
369	True	a	Hi there! It's one of those super cold, super crappy, super lazy days where all you want to do is curl up and watch a movie. My car is awful in the snow (which has already turned to slush, which will probably freeze soon...) so going to the supermarket is out. I seem to be running low on supplies so a pizza would be absolutely fantastic. No sad story, no dilemma, just a cold lady who would like to indulge. 
370	False	a	So as I stated above its rent time and there is no food in the house. I just need to hold off for a few days til payday but a pizza would help the week go quicker. I am from Southern California. Never done this before but I will definitely pay it back once I have a bit more leeway in my budget.
371	True	a	I'm a graduate filmmaking student at Montana State University in an MFA program. I'm currently working as an equipment technician on a series being produced for Discovery Channel. However, the company I actually work for is based out of the UK and getting my first paycheck has been quite a long time coming, as paperwork and such takes awhile to go back and forth. I'm currently down to $2.00 in my bank account.  I am expecting to get my first paycheck next week and will gladly re-visit this board to pay the pizza forward and buy one for someone else who needs it.   Thanks for listening. :)  EDIT: ReillyBoy helped me enjoy a delicious pizza from Dominoes and went even further. She has reminded me that generosity is alive and well in a time when selfishness seems to have run amok. 
372	False	a	it's been a busy busy term and i haven't been able to find a part-time job so the groceries have stretching since september and i just can't afford to get out to the grocery store right now. my cupboards hold nothing but an almost empty bag of pasta and my fridge just a can of tomato sauce. I need to do a lot of work this week, but I just can't concentrate due to weakness. Help me please and I promise to pay it forward.   edit: i live in victoria, bc. 
373	False	a	"So I had 100$ taken from my bank account by some fraudulent paypal scammer. Bank of America ""investigated"" twice and are now saying that the transaction was ""authorized"" setting me back a 100$ I don't have. A pizza would do wonders for my crappy, crappy mood right now. I'm located in Philadelphia."
374	False	a	I applied to work at a photography studio to gain experience outside my chosen field and have a chance to fulfill a dream of mine while making money for school. Didn't have any hope because of no past related history, but received a call 1 hour ago to be told I am a candidate for the second and final interview!   Obviously, as a pay-it-forward, I will fulfill a request as soon as I can afford it.  Thanks guys! 
375	False	a	I lost my job at pizza hut a little while ago, haven't had any luck finding a new job so far, now I'm out of money, hungry, and craving some non pizza hut pizza to spite my former employer! Would be very much appreciated.
376	False	a	I don't get paid until Tuesday. I have $3.50 to my name and I need that to get gas to get to work Monday and Tuesday and I'm so hungry. When I get paid, I'll of course bring it back here and pay it forward.  Please help before my stomach eats my kidney!
377	True	a	Hey everyone, I feel weird for posting this, but we're desperate. So, here it goes.  My girlfriend, **MuchToTheDutch**, and I both recently got jobs after three months of being unemployed new arrivals to Austin. This is awesome,but we started our jobs the 27th of June and we got paid through the 30th. This basically meant that we had just barely enough to cover our rent and bills. We've been living off rice, beans, ramen, and pasta for the last 10 or 11 days and we have to stretch it until next Monday when we get paid.  We haven't even been eating lunch; it's down to a meal a day at this point.  If some awesome person could hook us up with a pizza tonight, it would completely make our day. We'll pay it back two fold come Monday and post a follow up thread that day too.  Thanks,  **TexanInExile**  **Edit: [This is the guy I was talking about.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNZocat6NJE)**
378	True	a	Just really hungry and I finished off the last of my peanut butter and ramen noodles yesterday. Totally would appreciate some pizza love right now from Reddit.
379	True	a	Hello! It's been a hard 2 months with money and I listed some goodies on craigslist so I could make some food money for my family and the people never showed up =(  The cupboards are empty, no bread or P&amp;J. Is there anyone that wouldn't mind helping me out tonight? My family would appreciate it so very much. Thank you for your time in reading our plea.   Edit: Tarn33 Came to are rescue and soon my family will be enjoying some much needed pizza!
380	True	a	(Forgot to mention that I live in Central TX)   Long shot, but here goes.  I'm unemployed and going through a divorce. Aside from cheating on me she spent all my money and what little I had left went straight to the divorce. I'm down to my last $35.00-----period. This is AFTER selling everything I have that I don't still owe money on. I literally own nothing else but clothes, computer, car, and a dryer. My friends and family have already helped far too much and I'd hate to ask for more favors. I'm ALL out of groceries and won't begin to collect unemployment for another week or two. I didn't eat at all yesterday.   I was wondering if there was someone out there who would be kind enough to feed me today. I don't care what size or whats on it, I just need something to eat. 
381	False	a	So, I'm a student in London, and it's my birthday tomorrow. I can't really afford to buy a pizza but would love one! 
382	False	a	"I know, no one likes a sob story, but any offers would be appreciated by us. [Here's a picture of our dogs expressing gratitude.](http://i.imgur.com/YdimK.jpg) I followed all the instructions on the side bar so, I guess I'm verified.  I don't know if this helps but I haven't put on any clothes yet (been applying for jobs *online* all morning), and my wife says ""do you think being nude asking for pizza will make you more successful?"" what do you think reddit? will it? (i hope it doesn't do the opposite.)  Edit: I'm located in Southern California. I just saw the reminder to include location, i missed that.  Edit #2: Pizza has been received! thank you rorrim180! i was naked up until about 15 minutes before the pie arrived. i think it worked."
383	True	a	I get paid on friday and I have very little food to last until then.  I'm currently on the look out on a better job that would prevent this from happening, but no bites so far.  As soon as I have some available funds, I'll pay it forward.  Thanks!
384	True	a	Hey RAP, I just recently moved from my hometown near Seattle (had to get away from some toxic people) and am having a real tough time of it.  I don't like asking for handouts but I don't know how I can eat anymore ramen noodles.  Any help for someone who had to take out a payday loan just to make rent this month would be amazingly appreciated.  Thanks.
385	False	a	I've been eating a very limited meal after the typhoon hit my city. I hope somebody is willing to send me a pizza so I can at least enjoy eating one of meal (I don't know how will you send it but I'm from Santiago City, Philippines.)
386	False	a	My friend has no job and get one at the moment. A pizza would cheer er up.
387	False	a	"So the other day, a pack of flaming rabid monkeys entered my house and asked politely for a sandwich. They were too adorable, setting my house on fire and all, so I gave them a turkey sandwich. Right at that moment, my bank waddled in the door in a penguin costume and yelled, ""Stop right there! You're now in debt one turkey sandwich!"" I cried and cried; I was completely out of turkey sandwiches. I asked him if there was anything else I could do, and he said I could give him a pizza. So please, someone help me out here.  Also, to those who are thinking 'what an idiot', [check this out.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/j7naj/just_something_id_like_to_get_off_my_chest/)"
388	False	a	I just got fired from my job and I'm broke. I don't have any money or food in my house, I've been eating bread and rice all week, and on top of that I signed a NC/NDA where I was fired from and I can't even get another job working on the same type of stuff that I know how to work on (fixing cell phones, computers, and mostly reballing PS3 and XBOX 360s) due to the NC/NDA agreement they had me sign. I'm not sure what to do and I'm really hungry, if someone could please send me something like pizza or foods coupon I would really appreciate it. Thanks
389	False	a	So me and my wife are broke again until the end of the weekend. We live paycheck to paycheck and even though we are not starving to death or anything, the food budget wasn't very big after bills were paid. A pizza would really hit the spot about now.
390	False	a	Financial Aid ran out a few month's back, been borrowing money and selling everything I own just to make ends meet. Not trying to give you a sob story cause life isn't all that bad, I mean hey I graduate next month and Im healthy so im pretty happy about that. I just wish I could afford something to eat, let alone a pizza. Thank you for listening 
391	False	a	I'm swimming in student debt from my bachelor's degree while working on a master's degree. I live in a neighborhood many pizza delivery places won't go to, and if they do they don't come out of their car and you have to go out to them. I would love a pizza, or a gift card so I could pick up a pizza on my way home from my job. I just recently started making too much to qualify for food stamps anymore, but just barely. My food budget is tight, and things like pizzeria pizza are usually not an option.
392	False	a	Hi everyone,  I pizza'd someone last week(unfortunately they never posted a thanks, but i can post some screenshots of our conversation) &amp; its a non pay week, hoping someone will send me a pizza tonight for dinner.   
393	False	a	Well I'm watching my niece, my nephew, and two of his little friends tonight since their mom, my sister, is at work and won't be back until this evening.  They don't really like the food I have (Zucchini pancakes!!), and I don't have the expertise to make them something they'd enjoy.  So I come to reddit in hopes that someone can help the little ones have a dinner they'll like and hopefully hang out with their uncle even if they don't have too :)!
394	False	a	Im 27 and still living with my mom. I stay with her to help her through her pain and her work, she doesn't really have anyone else so I feel obligated to be here for now. My paycheck alone is going entirely to bills, medication, gas(which is killing me), other.. The one good thing is that the little money I do manage to save is going to my community college, so I am getting an education with the free time i have.. Regardless of all of that, there is nothing in my house to eat right now, and I am starving. Could you please help? It would mean the world to me and my mother right now, and it would definitely take care of 1 problem for tonight.  edit: General location- Rowlett, Texas
395	False	a	Will most assuredly return the favor or pass it along!
396	True	a	I am 19 weeks pregnant and I am home alone.  Lunch was minimal and I spent the day at a camp in the heat chasing 5 year olds.  We don't get paid until the end of the session, which is in 3 weeks.  Thank you for reading and for your consideration.
397	False	a	So my mom is without electricity for a week so my sister and her friend along with my mom are staying over here so they don't have to deal with this heat. My mom just started her new job and I got fired at mine a week ago :'( (have applied everywhere and am pretty much now harassing places hoping to get hired) I am currently without money and my mom doesn't have enough to buy dinner so I am coming to reddit for some help. I am in an area where there isn't much selection and I don't think the closest place (which is pizza hut) delivers out here but I do have gas to pick it up. Thanks.  EDIT: Forgot to mention that I would obviously repay the favor to someone else in the future. Thanks again!  EDIT2: Forgot to say what state in in d'oh I'm in Maryland
398	False	a	Not to post some long, drawn-out sob story I'll just leave it to this: It's been going pretty badly for a while now and it'd be nice to have some lunch today.  I'm in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota. 
399	False	a	It used to be that my brother and I would hang out together every Sunday, though since my niece was born, we haven't had that ability as frequently.  He is going to be here around 12pm PST (it is 9:15am currently) and I would like to have something for us to eat while he's here, though I am flat broke.  I even offer up the obligatory picture of [me with my niece](http://i.imgur.com/kvM0ISL.png) (taken just hours after she was born).  A pizza would very much be appreciated.  *EDIT - It turns out that it was a false alarm.  My brother was unable to make it here today after all, so I can have some soup.  Thanks anyway, RAOP.  I may try again one of these days.
400	True	a	I guess I could just eat the cereal, but that's all I've eaten for days. It's pretty nauseating. I've actually been really down lately because I literally haven't hung out with people in ages. That aside, I don't have a job anymore, and my food supply has gone low. If someone could just buy a pizza for me today, I would honestly appreciate it and spread it out as long as possible. Hopefully things will pick up around late July/August as everyone goes back to school
401	False	a	I am sick today, got the cold. I just can't make it outside today and I have no money.   *Anything will do.*  Thanks.
402	False	a	So I moved back home to Southeastern WI at the start of March when I could not find a new job. As soon as I got home a friend resigned and recommended me for his position. I'm just waiting for them to decide what to do with the position.  In the mean time I sure could go for some cheese. Especially tonight. Want a sob story? How about this. I bought myself a $6.00 block of cheese last week. Made two sandwiches from it and then my dad ate the rest. In one sitting. 
403	True	a	I'm currently dogsitting for a close friend. They were supposed to be home an hour ago, but I just got called and they have apologised and said they won't be back for about another 12 hours. They did say I could help myself to what was in the fridge, so I had a look and, and [this](http://imgur.com/vKTKU) was the sum total - 1 tub of butter, 1 tub of margerine, a tray of expired eggs, some wine, some flat pepsi, some stale milk and a bottle of lemonade. I'm so hungry right now it's unreal, and I will happily pay this forward when I get back home tonight.
404	False	a	I barely slept last night so this won't be very eloquent. Yesterday evening my little dog had a seizure. She's had them before (very rare, vet said not to worry bc of infrequency) so we let her ride it out and she seemed to be feeling better. Then at 5am this morning she had another seizure, then another at 8am. I brought her to the vets where she got diagnosed with epilepsy and given some medicine. When we got home she had a 4th seizure and I had to bring her back for IV medication and medical monitoring. I'm a grad student (ergo broke) and am out $450 in vet bills just today and worried sick about my pup.   Please help me out. There is a Papa John's nearby and also a locally owned small pizza place that does online orders. I can provide proof of my story and I'm sure my pup would love a little pizza crust when we get to bring her home. 
405	True	a	Pizza?  [1] http://i.imgur.com/vc2kG.jpg   Bonus picture of failed attempt to get my cats in on this:  [2] http://i.imgur.com/r4b2j.jpg   and cats previously mentioned:  [3] http://i.imgur.com/Uw9eW.jpg  
406	False	a	Hi everyone, I'm mainly a lurker which explains my sparse comment history but have long been aware of this subreddit and think it's a great idea! Our situation is that we are two full-time students scraping by, we've not been able to find jobs so far this summer and are living on very little. It's been a difficult couple of months and some pizza would be a much appreciated treat and give us a bit of a boost. It goes without saying that we would be very grateful and will return the favour next month when our finances are in a healthier state.  Thanks so much to anyone who responds!
407	False	a	Hungry in Waterloo, Ontario here. Will eat anything besides ramen =/  EDIT: can pay back in about a weeks time
408	True	a	hey redditros,   Just asking for a pizza for me and my kids. Single father, times are rough, and a pizza would surely help us bring our spirits up.   
409	False	a	I must leave the house I'm at in a few days. I don't have a place to go from here and haven't had the money for an actual filling meal in a while. I'm nervous about what's going to happen, but I'm also just thinking about my stomach too. I don't think I can eat another bite of Ramen or dollar store mac and cheese today. If anyone could help me I appreciate it beyond imagination. I would also save someone else once I land on my feet. I believe in Karma and sending it forward. Thanks for reading my woes.  Robin
410	True	a	...and all I have to eat here is banana bread, which I've been eating constantly and I'm sick of, and 3 corn dogs, which I'm saving for lunch at work tomorrow.  If someone answers my plea (and I do see there are more...pressing requests than mine open right now), I will look through your posting/commenting history and write a haiku about you based on it.  How can you beat that?  Answer: You can't.  Have verification code.
411	False	a	I'm skint have had to spend all my money on bills and really fancy pizza but cannot afford it. Instead of just plain out begging I thought i'd offer my drawing skills not saying they're any good though. Or i'll attempt to fullfill any other random things that I could possibly do?
412	True	a	Me and my boyfriend live paycheck to paycheck and we have about $40 to our name for the next two weeks :/ A pizza would make our week as well as a few meals! Hoping to get back on our feet next paycheck, and will absolutely pay it forward :)
413	False	a	Had a small breakfast this morning, but after 10 hours at school, and nothing besides sandwiches at home, I'd really enjoy a pizza if anyone's willing. :)  If not, thanks anyways!
414	False	a	My parents are really uptight about me spending my money on food, and I'm getting hungry.
415	False	a	I've been working door to door installing those TV energy saver things, and we get paid per unit as a sub contractor. My boss just decided that he isn't going to pay me. I'm owed about $1500, and there are 2 others in the same boat.  The last of my money I spent on rice and potatoes. It's hard to believe, but I have literally not spent any money in 3 weeks! I'm waiting on my tax return, and that day can't come soon enough. If you have any questions, I have some pretty hilarious stories about going door to door in rural Victoria, the job itself was pretty awesome.   Oh, and cheers to Vodafone who gave me free phone credit so I could get my tax submitted. Very cool of them. If you're kind enough to donate a pizza, I'd be very grateful and would obviously pay it forward. :)
416	False	a	Fiance took the car seat base, so we have no way of leaving our apartment today. Since we're stuck, it'd be nice to get a decent lunch delivered. Thanks for considering us!
417	True	a	I am seriously stressing about being able to pay my rent and utilities, and the three dollars in my bank account has to hold me until my last paycheck gets here, so I'd really appreciate it if someone could help me out with some pizza. Being independent for the first time is hard. -_-
418	False	a	I switched careers recently and won't be able to eat this week. It takes a lot for me to even ask here.  *Edit- I'm a bouncer now! Now if only I could eat enough to look like one. It's such a perfect job for me. All I've ever wanted to be is a ninja, and this fits so well. Do you have any idea how many calories sparring, weightlifting, parkour (ing) requires? Squirrels are not bulky.
419	False	a	I don't want to water fast for a week. My stomach hurts and I'm not going to have any money for at least a week. I work hard as a freelance writer every day but wages are 1-2 pennies a word. When rent is $600 and I earn $1,000 in a month, that doesn't pan out for insurance, food and the other responsibilities of life. I have no insurance now, nor do I have my car inspected. Poor is an understatement. I'm days away from being homeless.
420	False	a	I am currently only attending college due to a full scholarship. A nice cheese pizza would be greatly appreciated!  *first time asking for food
421	False	a	Just woke up from a nap and am really craving a pepperoni pizza from Pizza Hut. Anyone feel like blessing my belly with cheesy goodness?    **Edit:** I'm in Salinas, Ca (and spelling). 
422	False	a	I'm posting from a throwaway. Let me give you a run through of my typical day: I wake up, take a shower/get dressed, and head to hell. I work in a call center in a little cubicle where my only joy is seeing the clock hit 7pm. I sit in a chair and get yelled at for 8 hours. Sometimes 16 hours, because my boss likes to tell me that his star agent has taken off and he needs me to cover their shift. This rockstar agent also likes to come in late and is related to the head manager so..why would I complain about him? Who would I complain to? He's a pain in my ass always asking me questions that he should know the answer to.   My other co-workers are really good people and by good I mean aholes. One guy plays erotic games most of his shift on the company computer and no one seems to care. Another lady is a busy body Christian looking to convert everyone and anyone she can find. If she spent more time working versus running around telling everyone to have a blessed day, she'd get more accomplished. The other co-workers pretty much annoy the living shit out of me. They call me and ask for answers or blind transfer callers to me.   I know I need out of this job and I complain way more than I should. I should be happy I have a job. I should be happy I can barely afford my bills. Right right? Wrong! I've been looking everywhere else for work, but not many places are hiring near me. I'm so depressed with everything. My only motivation to go into work is for the check.  I'm hoping someone who has worked in customer service hell knows my pain and would be willing to treat me to some cheesy noms tonight. I will **absolutely** pizza it forward on pay day. I'm willing to provide a copy of my paystub and will send you a message from my main account if needed. I am really a broken man and I have completely lost my faith in everyone.   Thank you for reading and I'm sorry this was too long winded.
423	True	a	Hello fellow humans, another sad story is the last thing i want to put on here or read. Me and my daughter samantha are hungry, we just moved out of state and got into a new aptmartment.

424	False	a	I am a single dad living with my son and sick mother. I recently had to quit my job to stay at home with them because she can't watch him by herself while I work.The last of my money just went on the rest of my bills and we have no money to get any food. If someone could help I would really appreciate it and would return the favor when I am back on my feet.
425	False	a	My mother abandoned my family (father, sister, brother, and I) back in November and ever since we haven't even had enough money to buy food. We have taken out multiple loans to pay our rent and food banks won't give us Any more food. We spent the day today cleaning out our house and getting rid of more of my mothers stuff. It's been emotionally and physically draining and a pizza for the family would be great.  Thanks for reading
426	False	a	Been hungry since the day before yesterday. Just got a job washing dishes at a nice restaurant. No money until the fifth. I have to walk about a mile and a half to work, so any food is good food.  Had some pretty severe back injuries from 2009 hold me up all year in 2010, 200 pounds of insulation fell on top of my head. I would sure appreciate it.
427	False	a	Hi guys.  I feel embarrassed, but I'd like to humbly request some pizza assistance. I have -180 in my account until Friday, and it's all my fault. I paid rent twice this month by dropping off a check and then setting up bill pay online. I must have selected the wrong date, as March's rent was paid twice.   I've been fortunate to have friends who have chipped in with gas money or smoke for the last week, but my buddy's wife is probably wondering why I'm over so many nights for dinner.  One pizza would be dinner tonight, as well as lunch and dinner tomorrow until I wake up Friday to glorious pay day. I promise to pay this good deed forward, and I'm sorry again to be asking. 
428	False	a	The title pretty much explains it all. I've been working as a wings delivery driver while in college to pay for rent/bills/food etc. A week and a half since we've had a car/income. I'd really appreciate a random act of pizza, it would make my girlfriend, me, and Henry http://imgur.com/HRB8m our kitten very happy :). Thanks for reading.
429	True	a	My name is SPC Collins. I am stationed at Fort Hood, Texas. Been here all of 2 months, and am already having money issues. (which I'll admit is purely my fault.. Except for Hertz Rental Car, the 1400$ they told me was coming out daily, then just yanked out of the account in one day, royally screwed me..) No I am not in dire need or starving, but I have had a pizza craving from heck the past 2-3 weeks. If it helps my birthday was the 8th, and no I did not get a pizza then. I also deploy in less then 2 months. Will return any help when possible, either directly to the contributer, or to the community.
430	False	a	my bff showed me reddit and its a really cool site. i just broke up with my fiancee last night cuz he was cheating on me.  i also think i broke 2 of my toes when i got back home last night. they reeeaaally hurt.  im broke until pay day and i'm really down in the dumps with all of this. id love to eat a pizza while i watch with a league of their own tonight.
431	False	a	I used to work for a magazine company as a designer. There were multiple red flags that it was a really terrible place to work. My boss was nuts and employment there was like a revolving door. He fired me without cause about two months ago and since then I've been struggling a bit ands currently starting to sell possessions in order to buy food. I live in Chicago, IL and would really really appreciate a pizza... Thank you 
432	True	a	I've been eating ramen for a few days now. My mother offered to give me food, but I can't afford the gas to drive out to her house until I get my next paycheck, on friday. If anyone wants to help me get a pizza, I can either repay the favor on friday or pay it forward.
433	False	a	I'm a liberal arts student with zero dollars to my name and getting desperate. I'd be gracious and thankful for a pizza today 
434	False	a	Earlier this week I had a $115 water bill due to error and I do not know if I have to pay it or not. I am on a fixed income with three kids and three adults living under one roof, I have very little food in the cupboard and fridge with my food pantry giving out food next week.  My kids are tired of sandwiches and pasta (which my live in baby sitter makes while I work all day). I do have a verification code but no camera for proof because I cannot afford one. 
435	False	a	Hey, my mom went out of state leaving me in charge of the family biz while she is gone. It's 2pm and I can't leave to get lunch. Not like I know how to drive anyways. Would a pizza be too much to ask for? Please. Thanks. :)
436	False	a	So I'm hungry and kinda sad over the death of my grandmother and I couldn't go to the funeral due to her being in England and there is no way I could make it over their from the US. If you want the beta key just PM me. You owe me nothing for it as long as you enjoy it.
437	False	a	StumbleUpon brought me to this: http://randomactsofpizza.com/info.html#started  and that was 4 hours ago. I've been mindlessly browsing this site for 4 whole hours. I don't even NEED StumbleUpon anymore. FOUR HOURS. I'm amazed, and thrilled. I got brave and tried to make a comment, when I realized I hadn't actually created an account yet.  Hopefully I'm doing this right. Just requesting for one. I can share with my kitter. I just need something greasy to console me. I might never leave here. Is there anything I should know in general about Reddit? Obviously, it's a really confusing place.
438	False	a	My sister, an amazing person, is in a bit of a financial pinch. I really want to try to do something nice for her, but I'm in a bad patch myself. If anyone would be willing to help me send her and her family (husband, presschool son) a pizza to start off a nice weekend, I would appreciate it greatly. Thanks so much in advance for the consideration.
439	False	a	Recently quit smoking weed to save on the expense. Can't remember the last time I spent money that wasn't groceries. Could use some pizza to eat my stress away :). Will pay it forward when I'm in a better place.
440	True	a	So here I am, I'm jobless and literally have no money to my name. I get ¬£80 every 2 weeks from Job Seekers Allowance thanks to water supplier taking a chunk too, also I have to pay all the bills and well having done that I had little money for food and needless to say I have ran out and I am desperate as I don't get paid for a few days. If someone would be kind enough to help me out I will love them forever and try and repay their kindness as soon as I can.
441	False	a	Like it says, today is the last day of my vacation. Would love a stuffed crust pepperoni pizza. I'm in Northern Virginia. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
442	False	a	Hey all. Long story short my girlfriend recently had to move from home to Montreal, QC for work. She was told that she would be taxed in Ontario, but it turns out she is being taxed in Quebec. **That is a huge difference.** Her budget is shot and she really has no money left for food.   I will help her out a little bit but i am unemployed and living in Ontario still. Please Help me cheer my girlfirend up! I can honestly say i will make an effort to pay this forward.
443	False	a	"Hey reddit, longtime redditor here.. lurked for a few years then signed up about a year ago. Been going through some rough times lately. My mother passed exactly a year ago this week (February 13th, 2011), due to colon cancer at the young age of 55, sadly I cannot make it to her grave today to tell her how much I miss her, but I'm not much for hanging around dead bodies anyway, the soul has moved on and I'm almost positive she's someplace nicer. Me and my father haven't been getting along either, he is an alcoholic, anger-ridden man.. Ana and I couldn't afford our last apartment so we tried moving in with him, to help him with bills and whatnot, and he constantly berated me. I'm not sure why he is the way he is, but I think it has something to do with his mother. When I was 12 I was a lot heavier than the other kids and she would tell me about it, in the meanest possible ways. So I'm pretty sure that's where he gets it from. Suffice it to say, living with him without my kind and compassionate mom to stop him from getting so angry was nothing short of terrible. Ana kept telling me how badly we needed to save up and get out of there, we were there for a week and then it got really bad when he found we took 2 plates of food up to our room. He started screaming and calling me names like always, telling us that we're no longer welcome, telling us to pack our bags and basically to live on the street... then I decided to be clever (sarcasm) and call him a ""dick""  since he found it okay to call me every terrible name in the book, BAD move. I don't know how he heard me from the hallway, but he did. He slammed the door open, knocking over Ana's desktop computer, knocking over the desk it was set up on, and also knocking her over into our bed. He grabbed me by the throat and threw me up against the wall and started choking me out, much to Ana's dismay, she was crying and screaming at him the whole time, telling him to stop and let me go, trying to pull him off of me. Afterwards he offered us a ride to the shelter because we had her computer and all of our clothes.. we declined the offer. This was her idea. Then she gave me the best advice I have ever gotten concerning my father. Leave. Leave and never look back. He is not safe to be around. He is not a good person. So to say we've hit quite a rough patch is somewhat of an understatement. I'm not sure if this was all TMI but I really just feel a whole lot better getting it off of my chest. Ana is my hero, she really is, she is beautiful and she makes me feel like I'm actually worth caring about. If you've read this far, thank you so much.  But alas! Some good news! We both just landed new jobs yesterday. We both got hired as sales people at Sears... I know not much, but for around here it's pretty much the best we can find. I'm an IT guy, actually I'm more of a helpdesk-break/fix-troubleshooter sort of guy but I also have worked IT jobs. We do what we can to be happy and this area doesn't have many jobs so we're trying our best. We don't have a car (in a town where the buses don't even run on sunday or after 5pm any day, no joke- [www.lctabus.com/](www.lctabus.com/)) and we spent every last penny on rent. In fact, we still haven't paid our security deposit, luckily the landlord is a good lady and is understanding of our situation. So clearly there is no money for pizza. Which is upsetting, since pizza just so happens to be our favorite food, hands down. If someone can be help, we'll be sure to share it with our little puppy Horatio, who is the most adorable dog in the world,  he just turned 3 on valentines day! Here's a picture of me and him: ([Horatio and Bill](http://i.imgur.com/ohDJi.jpg)) , and for good measure here is a picture of my girlfriend/his mommy: ([Ana](http://i.imgur.com/qHmZL.jpg)) . Anyway... we will be sure to take pictures and post them, as long as they come out nice and she doesn't hate the way she looks in them. Either way we will be sure to make some sort of post thanking you. She's actually at orientation right now and I've got online training to do. Thank god we still have the internet! We're so damn lucky that one of our neighbors has unprotected wi-fi, otherwise we wouldn't get our daily Reddit fix. Sorry for the life story, just thought you should know the people who are requesting. We love you all.  .  PS: When we finally get our feet on the ground we will most definitely pay it forward. Today you, tomorrow me. "
444	False	a	Hey guys, a pizza would be awesome before i have to start diggin through the pantry/ freezer to make it to payday! thanks
445	True	a	I'm a college student who's a bit tight on cash right now. Any extra money I have is going towards my projects for my major, so I don't have much to eat and I'm craving a pizza.  FYI, there's no Papa John's in my town - only Domino's, Pizza Hut, and a couple local places - just to keep in mind if anyone is kind enough to make an offer.
446	False	a	So I'm new to this but I figured whats the worst that could happen... I just recently got an apartment with my boyfriend and we use all of our money on our rent... I'm extremely hungry and am getting tired of bacon and tater tots... plus the supply is running low... If some would be generous enough to help me out I would be extremely grateful. :)
447	False	a	There's not a could in the sky, and after a walk earlier I feel at peace with the world, rather than thinking of bills, loans and debt, for once. Nothing I'd rather be doing right now than on reddit!   Based near Albany, NY  I have a verification code. 
448	True	a	My buddy told me about this sub-reddit just a moment ago and I thought it was silly. I guess I'll post a request but if nobody replies that's great too. (I hope there aren't any rules that I'm missing if I did please let me know.)
449	False	a	so i have celiac disease and i have just started eating non-gluten things this month. the bread is awful and awfully expensive, lots of other very dry and pricey things...anyway i havent had pizza in so long!....... i've started watching TMNT....

We both lost our jobs in 08 and we moved from Toronto to Vancouver after trying to survive out east for work it was hit and miss, so we sold what we had and drove across canada. I just recently got a good job out here in Vancouver and hoping to get a place for Nov 1st. But we are out of food and gas as I'm waiting for my check on the 15th but we are all starving a random act of pizza would greatly lift our spirits.   **UPDATE**  Thanks for those that reached out to us the community centre closed at 9 near us which had the internet, but some guy outside noticed us shuffling things around in the car getting ready for bed and came over to us to talk, at first we were a bit freaked out but the guy was nice and gave us 40 bucks to get some grub and gas, I still didn't get that pizza cause the safeway was the closest place but hey maybe on my pay day on the 15th!! thanks again for all that responded and offered help
454	False	a	My dad lost his job in the last few weeks, I'm in school and working on getting a job but until then I haven't been spending on anything really.  I'd really love a pizza to enjoy while watching the Blues V. Hawks game tonight with my girlfriend Location: Illinois

Could you buy me a papa johns pizza here in tempe?  Thanks again RAOP! When I get my job, I promise my first check will be spent buying pizza for people here on the board :D
457	True	a	A friend of mine told me about this subreddit.  Maybe you guys could help me out.  I get by paycheck to paycheck, but I do alright for myself.  I, however, don't get paid until Thursday and I am not too proud to say I could use a pizza to munch on for the next couple of days until I can get to the store.  I have about $10 in my account, so I can get some food, but I also need gas and it's hard realizing that the gas is actually more important than food right now.  I'm in Alabama, if that helps at all.  Edit: Wow... thank you bakersdozen13.  I honestly didn't know what I was expecting, but this immediately fixed my problem for the next couple of days.  I'll be back in here after payday to pay it forward! ^_^  Edit 2:  Just picked everything up... Holy friggin god!  Above and beyond, good ma'am!  I will be back come payday to pay it forward!

I have a decent amount of allergies one of them being soy sauce but my mom still made Stir Fry which has it in it , No she is not a horrible person I just don't like getting heartburn anymore so I generally don't eat it.

If I messed up at all in here please correct me I read the right side bar a couple times but I feel like I am fucking up.  Also my family is not poor feel free to give to someone else in actually NEED for the food I am just hungry and bored.
459	True	a	So, RAoP, I've been unemployed now for 4 months, barely getting by on my unemployment. Surviving, but the jobs aren't looking up. Anyone that can help or be kind, I'd love it. You'd make my week. 
460	False	a	I am tired of ramen and anything that comes out of can. I'm really hoping someone can hook me up, because I only have a dollar to my name.

I am broke till next Friday and desperately hoping for some pizza. I live in Frankfort, NY. Thank you for reading.

463	False	a	"Three years ago today i tried a meatlovers pizza, this may come across as weird but seeing as how i am a jew it makes sense, and the joy it brought to me was incredible. So incredible that i in fact that being a 19yr old jew saw no reason to continue in that religion bc i was held back from pizza that long and for what reason?? cause the greatest food on earth, BACON, was considered ""unclean""??? Negative ghostrider the pattern is fulll. i need another pizza, soon or else bad things will happen to my friends. their life is in ur hands. Help a little old jewish guy and his broke friends out...get a NIGGA his pizza.   "
464	False	a	I'm writing this on behalf of my friends, They're currently stuck in PA on a 2 week long tour. They spent most of all the money they had on a smaller repair the day before. I donated what I could yesterday, but a $2,700 repair today has crippled them. I can communicate the terms, I'm positive these fun loving guys will send you T-shirts and silly pics. But we can discuss if you want them to write a song or something.
465	False	a	A recent college grad with a minimum wage job. Needless to say, I'm busy paying back student loans and just don't have extra cash for something like a pizza. My fridge is rather sparse, so I was hoping for something I could eat for dinner, it'd be much appreciated!
466	False	a	My sister and I live in the Fort area of Knoxville, and our shorter summer hours at work have allowed us to pay our bills (rent, medical, etc.) only.  Food is a little bit more difficult to come by because I have Crohn's/cannot eat gluten, but nearby pizza joints have been offering gluten-free options.  Any help would be so incredibly appreciated. Come next week, we'd love to return to the favor, too. Peace and love to all of you!
467	True	a	I know I've been helped before but I've gotten into this situation again and I'm extremely stressed out. I have no job right now and I'm sick of Ramen.  I would really appreciate it if someone could lessen my burden here by cheering me up a bit and I promise I'd be able to pay it forward!  Thank you!

473	False	a	I don't have a sob story, i'm just hungry and have nothing but condiments in my home after a poorly budgeted month.

476	True	a	"Hello. I've never posted in Random Acts of Pizza before, so I apologize if I'm not doing this correctly.  I'd love to surprise my wife with a pizza tonight if I could.  She worked from 4pm to 1am on Monday, and Tuesday. She then went back to work this morning (Wednesday) from 9am to 5pm.  Money is pretty tight in our household right now, and she has my debit card so I cannot surprise her myself. But she has been working really hard lately. I've very proud of her, and I want to see her rewarded for her efforts.  I work a ""normal"" 8-5, M-F job. So this will be the first time since Sunday we'll be at home together while not being unconscious. I hope this works out!  ( I don't know if any of the stuff below matters, I'm just trying to be thorough.)   We live in a college town, so there is a Pizza Hut, Domino's, Papa John's, and Papa Murphy's. No olives or peppers please. (She hates the first, and the second gives me acid reflux.) "

Wasn't thinking about food for the rest of the weekend. :( Anyway, I'm going to be moving back in with my parents within the next few weeks, at which point I'll have much less financial obligation and would love to participate in a Random Act of Pizza. :) If this reaches anybody willing to help out, I'd be much obliged. If not, I'll see you guys around... keep up the great work!

489	False	a	I am new at this, but my friends have done this, and helped out many. I now have a job to start repaying the favors to people in need, cause I do believe in the golden.  Heard the RAOP has kinda become disappointing over the time, with people not repaying the favor, or doing what people request, or even just thanking people.  I am here for help to turn that around if some of you could show me that there are still some kind hearted people out there and supply my bunk mates, and myself with some zas.  We just got the job building car washes, out of town, and don't get paid for the next two weeks.  Ramen noodles are just not cutting it for this work.  Help however you can, we would be grateful for anything!

I am a fairly young girl I don't work because I have social anxiety issues and my dad is retired gets very little money on pension from the state.  my brother and I usually eat noodles for dinner on the days my mum is away but he is an eating machine there are none left not sure what I am supposed to eat and a friend directed me here. feel slightly ashamed to have to resort to this though please don't take that the wrong way. any help kindly appreciated though definitely not expected  thanks for reading :)
493	False	a	Hello redditors,  I'm an unemployed college grad who moved up to Berkeley to pursue my startup dreams.  I've tried to find part-time work, but it seems like not many folks are currently hiring.  I've tapped my savings, and the fridge is empty.  Please, help a brother out!
494	False	a	Avid pizza fan, would LOVE a pie. Thanks in advance kind people!
495	False	a	Just found out i'm going to have to withdraw one of my classes because im not doing very well in it first year in college so stressing i hope i can make it through. In the Bronx, New York
496	False	a	My gf is going through a slew of pretty serious shit. Some of it could be considered extreme first world problems (got in trouble with the law for something anyone could get in trouble for), as well as dealing with more severe troubles (ailing family member).   No she isn't homeless, poor, etc., but I thought I'd write this request anyway.  Today is a big day for her, one that determines the consequences of her immediate future. It would be nice if she could come home to a free pizza, and to the knowledge that a random stranger decided to do that for her. She's vegetarian btw.
497	False	a	I've been feeling pretty crummy all weekend.. 8 of my friends left on a trip to Japan, and the weather here hasn't been at all great. I just got a job, but I work from home, and now that it's summer, everyone at my house is gone but me. I'm definitely not used to being alone so much. Needless to say, it's all brought my mood down.  I've never done anything like this pizza act before, but it would definitely make my week if someone would send over a cheese and pesto pizza or something.
498	True	a	Hello, I've never posted on here before so please excuse me if I'm doing this wrong.   I found out today the company I work for hasn't been making any money for awhile now and will have to close soon, meaning I will soon be out of a job. I'm so tired after sending out resumes all night long that I don't even want to think about making dinner. A pizza would be much appreciated.   Hope you all are having a better day then mine! Thanks 
499	False	a	I am a college student doing my best to make it on my own, and have not had money to afford anything but ramen and toast for too long. i'm dying for a delicious pie.
500	False	a	We're in Washington state. We spent the rest of our money catching up on bills this month. My cousin worked extra hard at his job to make sure we could cover the bills. I'd love to surprise him with a nice hot pizza when he gets home a little after 9. I'm willing to make a deal to hold a contest 8/23/2013 for a pizza giveaway.  Edit: I am willing to set this up for a different day. He still deserves a pizza even if it's not tonight.
501	False	a	It's been a while since I last had pizza and I would really love some. I'm located in Utah. Domino's and Pizza Hut are both close by. 
502	False	a	and I couldn't be happier! I'm so thankful to be employed. It's at a distribution center and I was always the type of girl to work in an office. Not any more, I love it! My dad (who literally has 2 dollars in his pocket) and I are here alone while my mom is away and would love a pizza to share. I will happily pay it forward once I start getting my first paychecks! Thank you!
503	False	a	Throwaway account, I have friends that are redditors  Recently my wife lost her job, we have too many bills, my mother passed away due to diabetes and now I just got in a crash recently. I have a lot of bills but not enough money and my family suffers for that. A pizza would really help us cope with all this bs that life is throwing our way. I have a beautiful wife and a really awesome son who I love very much. I know begging is the last thing people want to do but I am at that level. I don't know what to do and I have barely enough money to cover all of this. I would really appreciate it if someone would gift us a pizza and I'm sure so would my family. The chances of me getting one are low but its still worth a try. God bless you for reading this and thank you. If by some miracle someone gifts us one then I would gladly repay the favor when I get back on my feet.
504	False	a	Anything to eat. My gf and i are house sitting. Have no food or money. We get paid on saturday for the house sitting.. We dont want to eat the food of the house and cannot get a hold of the house owners to ask. My check is a day late. My company can be shaky with paying on time. (Direct deposit) Today is honestly the worst timing yet. I humbly ask to my fellows members of the internet. I am about to tell her the bag of pop corn we ate IS our Thanksgiving. 
505	True	a	Hi there! My name is Jill, I'm a college junior living in Maine for the summer with my three sorority sisters. We are currently flat broke until payday on Saturday (well, Friday at midnight) and have a depressingly empty fridge to match our depressingly empty bank accounts. A night off from scrounging up what little is left of the food in our apartment would be nice! :)  We would really, really appreciate if someone could help us out in the pizza department. We have already decided to return the favor come the weekend. Thank you so much if you can throw us a bone (er, pizza) and we hope you all have a good evening!
506	True	a	If you're willing to get me a large Ultimate Pepperoni Feast and a 2L of Coke from Dominos (I'll pick it up to spare you the delivery charge), I'll give you a shoutout in the next episode of my [YouTube series](http://youtube.com/samuraientertainment) in addition to the usual thanks.
507	False	a	just moved to columbia, sc...I start my job on next Monday and am a little tight on cash to say the least with rent due this week. Would appreciate a random act of pizza (kindness) to help out one night. 23 years old and just starting out! Thank you for reading!
508	True	a	Hi guys, if you've clicked in this post and you're reading this, then thank you for at least considering my plight.  I'm just looking for a morsel to eat is all. I didn't eat all day today (United Kingdom, Tuesday), and I won't eat all day tomorrow (Wednesday) until I get my housing benefit on Thursday, which is meant to pay my rent but doesn't even cover that and I will now have to do food shopping with.  I have 7 pence in my bank account currently I believe. I would really, *really* appreciate it if some one could make it so I didn't have to go two days plain hungry.  Thanks for your reading, and thanks for your time and consideration. I only ever wanted to get by. Let me know if you're interested in helping.   Thanks.
509	False	a	From March 30th to April 1st, all of my nearby family (nuclear and extended), will be having glorious fun times at the beach during Spring Break, but I CAN'T go because MY Spring Break was 2 weeks ago because I'm in college and they have to be all DIFFERENT and SPECIAL. When this happened last year, I ate nothing but cottage cheese from the back of the fridge seasoned with tears of loneliness(hyperbole for comedic affect) because I'm shit at cooking dinner(and lazy).  BUT...  What if there was a glorious community of internet Supermen, capable of setting me up with some sort of electronic code, equivalent to some amount of money, with which I could order GLORIOUS CIRCLES OF CHEESE AND BREAD, preferably from Papa Johns, and HAVE THEM DELIVERED TO MY DOOR BY WHITE STALLIONS THAT SHIT SPARKLES?  Anyone feeling generous? Sparkle-shitting stallions are optional, if that would help.
510	True	a	Title says it all. The two guys that were scheduled to work with me today both didn't show, so I'm stuck talking to customer and fixing computers alone all day long :(  Normally the owner would buy me lunch in these situations, but he just had a hip replacement, and I'm stuck running the show till he gets back.   It's no biggie, but I can't leave to grab lunch. There's a Papa Johns around the corner that we usually order from for company outings.   If anyone's willing.. I guess shoot me a PM and we'll work out the details?? I've never done this before...  
511	True	a	I'm a student who just finished with finals, so I can't complain I need brain food or anything, but honestly the paycheck I received most recently was from Thanksgiving week, and I got paid about $140 less than I usually make. Because of this, almost all of it went to Christmas presents.  I tried to buy a bag of chips the other day and my card was declined. I have overdue bills, an empty stomach, and no way to fix either. I don't get paid until Thursday, which is approaching quickly, but not quickly enough. Please help a hungry Redditor out tonight with a pizza, I would be forever in your debt if you did
512	False	a	I'm from MS and I've been waiting since Monday for my paycheck to arrive at my work with no luck.  I could use a little something to hold me over.  Will gladly pay it forward when it arrives.  Thanks guys.  
513	False	a	She's very crabby, very pregnant and all she wants is pizza. She's got two 5 year olds (twins) and a husband, but he doesn't get paid until next week.  If anybody wants to send some pizza her way, let me know. (Let me know how I can verify, and I'll do so.)  Thanks guys!
514	False	a	In MA near Boston. Will most definitely pay it forward when my paycheck comes in. 
515	False	a	Had minor surgery on Sunday that put me on some restrictions such as no driving until cleared. So I'm stuck here bored and hungry with pizza on my mind, and I was curious if someone would be kind enough to send a pizza my way. Thanks.
516	False	a	UK - I don't want to sound like i'm begging but i live in the uk and there is a few days now before i can go home. I have ran out of food and i am living off bread. After the exams i am just fed up and want to go home. I do not even need a full pizza, a kebab would even be most appreciated right now. Thanks anyone if you can help.  As a side note: i did not know whether to put this worldwide or not. I have never done this before and if i paid for it then i can pay with paypal. If others do then i guess it would be uk only.
517	False	a	and I'm all out of bubblegum.
518	False	a	Hi everyone.  I'm currently between jobs and looking to give my girlfriend a little treat on her birthday, a day we both don't have the means to properly celebrate right now.  We've still got food in the pantry so we aren't going hungry, but I'd like to switch it up a little bit with some cheesy comfort food.  Any kind souls out there today?
519	False	a	Hey there you guys! I'm a college freshman, and I'm in serious want of some fresh pizza. I don't have much spending cash, and I would really appreciate it if someone could lend me a hand. **** EDIT: I'm in Ohio, about a half an hour out of Cleveland. I go to a tiny college, in a tiny town. I'm studying political science!  
520	False	a	No job and living with two other roommates. Both of them are away at the moment. One on Navy duty, the other has a death in the family and is out of state. Ran out of ramen today, would love a pizza to tide me by. Thanks.
521	False	a	As the title says, I recently lost my job do to contract cancellation. I would really appreciate a pepperoni pizza. I will repay the effort once I am back on my feet. I'm a bit hungry filling out all these job applications.
522	False	a	My roommate and I got a surprise from Comcast this month in that we got a service charge we were not aware of.  So the $30 I thought I would have extra this month is now gone. I'm in Fresno, CA
523	False	a	No sob story or anything like that I'm just a dude with no cash and food for the day and would really appreciate someone giving him a pizza.
524	False	a	yep. like i said....im broke and dont have much but i do have two copies of dota i can give away to you or any random, or do whatever you want with them. So if someone helps me out, it would be greatly appreciated and I will pay it forward when the time comes and i have extra cash
525	False	a	"Hello Redditors,  have you ever received something for free? Did you remember how good that felt, just because ""hey, free stuff"" ? Well, I hadn't had that feeling in a while and I just want to experience it. I know the power of the internet would blow my wife's mind and my daughter would think I'm a magician. Honestly, it's not about the money, I'll pay the pizza forward to another random redditor or back to yourself(today you, tomorrow me), it's just for science , to know if free pizza really does taste better. "
526	False	a	Good day kind folk of /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza;  As stated in the title, my class is holding a debate on the true nature of man, good or evil- myself and half of the class on the 'good' side, the other half on the 'evil' side. While myself and my peers discussed various properties of our assigned moral alignment, the concept of charity came up in discussion- and some of us being redditors, we immediately thought of this subreddit.  It would be greatly appreciated if someone could send us a pizza of any size and type (preferably something generic) around 8:35AM PST, October 13th, and hopefully inspire our pessimistic peers to see past the idiocy and greed omnipresent in our media and wall street and realize that there is such thing as pure human charity. **We remain committed to returning the favour to the subreddit as well, to an equal or greater value than the sent pizza :).**  Note: We do not intend on using any sent pizza as a bribe, if there is enough to share with our small class of 15 people (it's an alternative high school) we will. We believe we have a solid argument and the pizza will be delicious evidence :).  Thank you /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza for your time!

527	False	a	My friend on facebook told me about this site. Single mom here...we are currently going through some hard times. We have canned goods, ramen, bread and such but nothing really good and feeling until I get foodstamps thursday. The kids and me would appreciate some pizza tonight if possible. Located in NC.
528	True	a	That's about it, I suppose. My wife fortunately makes enough for us to scrape by but treats are rare these days.  EDIT: ~~I PMed azzip_oAR as requested and sent him my email. He says he sent me a Dominoes gift thingy via e-mail but that was 30 minutes ago and it hasn't showed up in my inbox, should it take that long?~~  EDIT2: [YES, IT SOMETIMES TAKES AWHILE.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/huz3x/request_laid_off_for_a_few_months_now_not/c1ylhbj)   Thanks to azzip_oAR and everyone else here, this rocks.
529	True	a	"Hey guys,  I've heard good things about this subreddit, hopefully someone could help out with a pizza just until friday?  Recently moved and my first check was almost entirely spent getting the deposit covered for power and the last half of my move in cost.  I saw ""almost"" because I only have about $0.75 left until Friday.  Would someone want to help a guy out with a pizza until the end of the week?  I will gladly pay this forward the very second I'm paid again.  Thanks so much reddit!  edit: I do have a verification number."
530	False	a	Girlfriend is HUNGRY.  Won't be paid for a while so have been eating fucking poppyseed crackers to stave off hunger today.  I know this is America centric so it's a long shot.  EDIT: Worth noting that when i do acquire funds this week I will pay it forward to another UK resident
531	False	a	Philadelphia, Hospital of the Univeristy of Pennsylvania Emergency Department. PM with details. You guys are awesome.
532	False	a	Been looking for a job for 6 months and to this day I still have no luck. Would appreciate it if someone can help a brother out.
533	True	a	I got laid off from my job on December 12th unexpectedly, and have been struggling to get back on my feet ever since. Help with food for a night or two would be really appreciated for me and my SO since I couldnt spoil her like I wanted for christmas.  If nobody can help, I hope everyone has a wonderful day and good luck on all those New Years Resolutions!  Happy Belated New Years  
534	False	a	I have been eating top ramen for the passed week and I just can't tolerate the taste anymore. A nice delicious pizza will definitely hit the spot right now. Thank you in advance! 
535	False	a	First person to offer us a pizza gets a custom made duct tape wallet made by us! :)
536	False	a	Broke until the weekend and barely have groceries :/ have enough to survive but I would really love pizza....I'm a known pizza addict amoungst my friends. I would be forever grateful!
537	False	a	dropped my phone in the mop bucket today and the only number I remember is not around
538	False	a	I don't really know how this works, I just found out about this subreddit,  but basically I'm a broke college student living with my boyfriend, who (he, not I) earlier this month became unemployed. I would love to surprise him tonight with something other than rice or ramen noodles, even if only to lift his spirits just a little bit. Hopefully somebody here could help me do that for him. 
539	True	a	Today is the first day of summer for my kids. Im recently unemployed so I dont have any extra cash for a fun meal right now. I would love to surprise them with some pizza for lunch or dinner. They are expecting Pb&amp;j and would be thrilled to have pizza instead. Thanks for reading!
540	False	a	Hey guys, just stumbled upon this subreddit and was amazed that this even existed, i never knew other people had the same addiction as me! anyway if anyone wishes to do this i will be very grateful and i can go to bed knowing that there are some awesome people out there! and i will repay to the next poor soul who gets the shakes from pizza withdrawal as we all know its a serious condition.
541	False	a	Title says it all...Studying for finals, pretty broke, dining halls are too expensive and I don't have money for a meal. Would love a pizza to help me get through this night...could even give you a Rift 60 day time card from when I used to play, i've had it forever.  Any help would be SERIOUSLY appreciated! Thanks!
542	True	a	I'm not in College, or a starving artist or anything like that. I've just been a bit unlucky lately. I'm a 36 year old single guy with a job. But rent, and other bills killed me this month. I thought I had enough funds in my account to at least keep me set with Mr. Noodles, I forgot about my monthly banking fee.  I had a small bag of chips Wednesday afternoon, and I get paid Monday, so I'll be fine then.. It's just really painful at this point and food is something I'm constantly thinking about.  I've got a few bucks to get on the bus to work on Saturday, so I can't really use that.  I'm really embarrassed to even be asking like this and I'm not sure how it works, so please be patient with me.  I guess that covers it. Thank you in advance.  Cheers folks.
543	False	a	I don't get paid until Wed at my new job(so exciting!) and sure I could go buy some groceries - but who doesn't want a yummy pizza? My cat will surely love you :)  Thanks!
544	False	a	Struggling to find employment. Would love a pepperoni pizza.
545	True	a	[relevant source as to why I would ask total strangers for pizza](http://i.imgur.com/nhCti.png)  I'm a little down on my luck for a few days and if anyone can spare the charity of a sausage/pepperoni pizza, it'd be well appreciated. Thank you for your time and happy holidays.   I live in North Georgia, near Berry College. I made a throwaway at first, but the peeps in the RAOP chatroom told me it'd be more genuine if I posted on my main. It's a little embarrassing to ask, but all I ask for is charity in exchange for my humility. 
546	False	a	Wednesday: Moved out of my house, marriage in shambles.  Friday: In the ER with kidney stones. Intense amounts of pain.  Saturday: Missed my sister-in-law's wedding due to both previous events.  Monday: Reamed by my boss for shabby work, given this week to work on it.  Today: Oh crap it's Wednesday already. A long evening of work awaits.  If anyone wants to order me an [Austin's Pizza](http://www.austinspizza.com/menu.php) (the Redditor, of course) then it would add a little bright spot to my week. My friend, who's offering his couch rent-free, would appreciate the free grub as well.   PM me if you're willing, no hard feelings if you're not.
547	False	a	I'm 18 years old and I graduate this summer from high school. After a heated conversation with my parents I told them that I was an atheist. Being super religious, this did not go over well with them. Instead of loving their child unconditionally, they decided to kick me out of the house. (Thinking back on everything, I probably should have waited till I was in my college dorm later this year).   Anyway, I've been staying in an extra room at a friends house. They're gone for a week and I thought at least try here. A pizza can hold me over for a few days till I can get my small part time job pay check.
548	True	a	I'm running out of money, so is my girlfriend, lots of stress over whether she'll be forced to drop out of college or not over parents unpaid taxes. Feels bad, man. I'm also running out of card swipes for dining hall food, and won't have enough to eat throughout finals. Pizza would be appreciated, and we'll send you an artsy photo of a building on campus. I also give the solemn promise to donate back to the community by buying someone pizza with my first summer paycheck. EDIT: Feeling like an idiot: Greeley, Colorado.
549	False	a	So here's my story, I just applied to transfer for other schools because I can't afford my current one so I just dropped 270+ dollars on applications, I am also currently taking an EMT course that up until now I thought was completely paid for and just found out I have to pay for the simulation test, on top of the National Registry test and also get my Ambulatory License before I can even apply for a job. This all adds up to another 300+ dollars and I just had to pay rent which was another 450+ dollars. I have no food in my apartment except for 6 bags of popcorn and a gallon of water, and I have 20 dollars left in the banks. I don't have an official job but work in landscaping making money on the side whenever they have room for one more worker. My parents help but they can't help much and I don't want to worry them with this. A pizza would help me a lot, that would at least secure me for 3 more days just to keep the hunger away, especially during my finals week where concentration is a necessity. So please help, I have requested before when someone posts an offer but right now I am really really desperate so please help.   I'm in California, specifically San Diego.
550	False	a	Hit the random button just now and found this subreddit. I have to be tested soon so i have to give it up. I live in texas
551	False	a	Having one of those days where everything is getting on top me, left my counselling session feeling rather blue, no moneys and none of my freinds are around to cheer me up in the flesh. :(
552	False	a	No sob story here. Just a hungry kid in college with not a lot of money and a lot of homework. (I have to translate 70 lines of Ovid love poetry. HELP ME OUT.
553	True	a	The title pretty much explains it. I live in New York and flying home to CA for the week isn't worth the expensive plane ticket, and my personal income is quite dismal as a college student, so any Spring Break destination is out of the question. I understand that a lot of people are in the same situation and that it probably isn't the best time to ask for help, but I thought might as well try. It would really be appreciated!
554	False	a	Don't want to spend much on takeout so I'm starving myself. Would really love the help  ---  a broke college student
555	True	a	I was invited to Reddit after playing checkers on Yahoo. I told the person that I was playing that I was craving a pizza, but didn't have any money to buy one. They suggested that I try my luck here. I've been eating rice and beans for about a week and while I shouldn't complain, it is getting old. A nice Hawaiian pizza would be more than enough for the wife and I. Something different to lift our spirits. Happy New Years from North Carolina!
556	False	a	Hey, RAoP! Just hanging out with a friend before I leave for school in England! A free pizza would totally make the night!
557	True	a	"I'll spare the juicy personal details, but I lost a group of friends and a boyfriend because someone thought it would be fun to tell them all horrible, ridiculous lies about me. I really liked all of them, and took a huge risk trusting these people because I thought they were Good People. (I'm a child abuse survivor, so I have a real hard time opening up.) I also put in a lot of energy (made gifts, gave encouragement, helped calm down anxiety attacks...)  The good news is, if they're that quick to turn on me based on someone's false information, I don't want them in my life anyway. They never asked me if it was true, just took it as fact. That's not a ""friend"" in my book.  The bad news is, it obviously hurts really, really bad. I'm doing the best I can to not fall apart. It's really hard to stop thinking about everything that happened. I feel like I stepped on a landmine, everything blew up in my face. I really want to watch a movie and eat some pizza and forget about all this drama for a bit. (I'm broke, so anything not eaten tonight will help sustain me until payday!)   A gesture of kindness in the form of a pizza or even an inspiring message would mean SO much to me right now.  On a side note, pizza or no pizza, this subreddit is a great reminder that there are still kind people in the world."
558	True	a	College student here, out of luck lately. Out of a job for a while, and just spent $300 on textbooks for summer classes. I've been living on rice and ramen lately, and would really appreciate a warm pizza for a change. I'll be sure to pay it forward the moment I get my next paycheck.
559	False	a	The toppings do not matter to me. I will eat almost anything.
560	False	a	EDIT: Disregard, girl invited me to BBQ.  See you in a month, I'll still send out the pizzas.  All alone on fathers day sucks more than I thought it would.  I don't need much, just a small cheese from someone who cares to cheer me up.  I don't have enough $ for pizza and the gas I'll need to work my shitty job.    I've never done this before but if I get something I'll send out two pizzas next month in your honor.
561	False	a	Been out of work for two weeks, but my new job in NYC starts on Monday.  It'll be another two weeks before my first paycheck and it's getting scary putting everything on the credit card.  Pizza sounds awesome on a Saturday... while I sit at home and catch up on some new episodes of adventure time...  Edit: despite our best efforts on an international pizza order, pizza did not come through.  But I want to thank /u/powdered_water for trying so hard, anyway! I'm gonna cook some rice and veggies, tonight, but if somebody wants to buy me a pizza for tomorrow, I'll happily accept! :D
562	False	a	I've planned a fun evening for us, but a surprise pizza would be really amazing! I will of course pay this forward when I am able to :)
563	False	a	Hello everyone. School is out today and I wanted to treat my kids to some pizza for lunch, I heard about this site through my neighbor and figured I could give it a shot. It is not a need , I do have soup for them. I just wanted to surprise them since they work so hard. I just don't have it right now. I am willing to return the pizza happiness next week. Thanks for reading. Have a wonderful day!
564	True	a	Unemployed and broke future soldier and his wife. Out of food and could use some help, will gladly pay it forward come January when I ship. Thank you.
565	True	a	Not to be cliche, but I'm a broke, last-year college student trying to get through the night. I would be more than willing to pay it back/forward after I get my check next week from my job. School starts tomorrow and I will have meal plans, so no worries for the rest of the semester. Feel free to check my account, it's over three years old and I participated in Secret Santa and Arbitrary Day if that gives any credibility to my intent in hitting someone back. Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this.
566	True	a	Been eating the same stuff in for a week now, and pizza craving is pretty high.  edit: nevermind, my father surprised me himself.
567	True	a	Worked until 2 AM on Wednesday night. Came in Thursday and was given two-weeks notice. STILL WORKING at 9pm on Friday. I'll probably not get him until 10pm or so
568	False	a	Long story short: i got kicked out of my house for asking to take my computer to a LAN party. (i am NOT exaggerating)  for the past couple weeks i have been staying with my dad &amp; his girlfriend, but yesterday i ran out of the money i had been saving. I don't get paid for another 2 days and i am absolutely famished.
569	False	a	A pizza would be fucking awesome.  Between paychecks, GF is out so shes not cooking and a meaty pizza while studying some science would be great.
570	False	a	Two Students Based in Liverpool, Very Skint at the moment, would appreciate to have such a luxury!  Cheers
571	False	a	If anyone can get a pizza ordered to czech republic, I'd be very grateful. It'd be much cooler than eating porridge for the last 3 days!
572	False	a	I'm not really sure how this works. What I need to tell you and such. I went out of the country last year, spent all my money, moved back into my old house with my roommate. But ever since I've had the hardest time getting back on top of my money. I had 2 jobs, but I decided recently to quit one and just move back in with my parents. I've got about 2 weeks left in this house, me and my friend who also doesn't have anywhere to stay live in this room. So now all my money goes towards paying off past due bills and people I owe money too, all Ive got in the kitchen its canned soup and fruit. Which is food, but its almost worse than eating ramen everyday, like a awful liquid diet.  But whatever, I'm not gonna complain. I thought I'd see if theres anyone who'd like to share a pizza with me and my roommate sometime? Where located in Memphis. I suppose you PM me for the rest of the details.
573	False	a	3 bros, 1 chick, and maybe you?  I want Pizza.  Roundtable Pizza   Lan party this bitch.  
574	False	a	I had to move out of my home last week, I'm staying at my office until I can get back on my feet. (Throwaway because my boss is a Redditor and he doesn't know I'm staying here.)  My bank account has ran dry due to catching up on bills. I don't get paid until Saturday. I will pay it forward once I get paid, and I will even use my main account to do it!  Anything will help.
575	False	a	My family is grieving now over the loss of our dog, Ryan. My kids are  handling this as best as they can, but more than anything we could really all use a hug right now.   About two weeks ago, I came home to find Ryan walking into the wall. I picked him up to see if he would recognize me, but he wasn't his playful self. I rushed him to the vets, where he was kept overnight. The next evening I got the news that he needed to undergo liver shunt surgery. His surgery was scheduled for today, but he passed away overnight.  This little angel went through many bouts of going to the vets. Some  days he was bouncing around and playful, and some days he wouldn't do much of anything. I didn't think he could have been suffering from  something so serious.  I'm doing my best to be strong for my children, but Ryan was like one of the children. I haven't been able to do much of anything today, and I'm hoping someone out there would be willing to buy dinner for my family tonight. Outside of struggling to pay bills, we've now lost a member of our family.

576	False	a	Hey chaps,  I've been having a difficult time recently with my layoff, and it's honestly been a while since I've been able to get take out. So, any fine chaps and lasses want to help a fellow Redditor out? I'll compensate once I get my tax refund back in the future if that's incentive too :)  Cheers!
577	False	a	This is my first time hearing of this subreddit and I'd love it if someone could help me out. I'm just about starving. :( Thanks in advance and I'll return the favor.
578	True	a	Hi! My parents are out of town and I'm flat broke in real life money BUT I have some money in a paypal account. Would anyone be willing to order me a pizza and then accept a paypal reimbursement + a 5 dollar tip?  A magnificent redditor by the name of mmmcandy has helped me out. He is one bad ass mother fucker... who likes candy. Thank you!
579	False	a	I made a request yesterday and sadly I got no response. Unfortunately I am still out of food and was hoping today I would have better luck. Here is the original thread I started http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/i6oek/requestran_out_of_food_please_help/  Any help would be awesome. 
580	True	a	I've been having a hard time recently and I'm unemployed but I'm not eligible for any welfare because I'm not British. I'm hardly managing to pay my rent and gas bills and it's freezing up her right now. Some pizza would go a long way tonight. I don't believe in karma, but I will pay it forward.   I'll answer any questions here.   Thanks. 
581	False	a	Moved up here hoping to get a better job, didn't work out like that. Have a job, but it's enough to pay the bills, and that's really it. Payed rent, got cat food for the kitty, and TP. Pretty much emptied the bank account. Still looking for a better job, but until then, a hot cheesy pie would really make my day!
582	False	a	We would all really appreciate it, and would even send a picture of the three of us enjoying the said pizza (if that's your thing).  Just curious to see if this works!!!
583	False	a	Its been a while since I've been on a site where random people can get together and contribute something real.  I miss the days when Bots in a chat room (that most people goto irc doesn't count, those bots are friendly) were a minority, .   Myself and room mates do a lot of donation of our time and limited resources, helping those less fortunate that showed up at the Occupi.   When we have an abundance we try to make the trickle down thing work, but it is tough to do with food, preparing, freshness...  The local Z-Pizza is good.  1 roommate is vegetarian, and 1 is vegan.  They aren't the picky type they just take the meat of and give it to me.  Also if someone at the pizza place drew something funny on the box the we'd appreciate a good laugh. will post pix of pizza box.
584	False	a	Things just haven't been going the right ways. My friends and I have been getting distant... I feel like I've been sleeping all day and there is nothing in the house to eat. Perhaps a pizza could help?
585	True	a	Hi all -- I've been referred here by my sister in Wisconsin where this was mentioned on her local news. After paying our utility bills and only partial rent this month, my family is down to 8 cents in the bank until the 1st. I go to food pantries in my area when I need to, but they only operate on certain days and will not be available for a few. I can provide any proof and would gladly pay anything back. A little food for me and my kids would help a lot right now.
586	False	a	I'm 21 years old, just got out of a bad relationship and we have a 17 month old. I just moved in with my friend until I get my feet on the ground, I don't get paid until next Friday and I'm more than willing to help someone else out as soon as my funds allow me. I've never been in such a shitty situation, and I don't know what to do. I'm hungry and reaching out to you redditors
587	False	a	single mommy . family of 8 in Yucca Valley calif . We have been blessed with a house but it took every single penny. I would love for my kids to come home and see the sparkle in thier eyes to see some Pizza. Small Blessings are Beautiful
588	False	a	I've been stuck at home with an upper respiratory infection and ear infection since last Thursday. On top of that, I broke my pocketwatch while swinging it, and I broke a bracket on my braces while gnawing on a cough drop. A random act of pizza would make my day :) 
589	True	a	Alright guys, I don't have some major sob story, my life isn't that bad or anything, I'm just broke until next Thursday when my University issues refund checks to students. My promise to you all, is that if I can get a pizza tonight, I will pay it forward to a lucky individual next week, when I get my loan money from school. Otherwise, I'm making ramen tonight (again). Here is a picture of me with my scooting goggles on, so you know how serious this is. We roll hard down in the southwest.   http://i.imgur.com/q6D4x.jpg
590	False	a	Can definitely use the verification system, I live in ohio and can give you a pizza place number if you want or the places in the area. I don't have any gas to pick it up and won't till I get paid. Thank you for any help!
591	False	a	Pretty much she left me home to go to a houseparty! Ive just started breaking bad so would love to eat pizza along with this... thankyou!  ( Also in the UK if that helps? )
592	False	a	Hey guys,  I promised myself I wouldn't do this because I'd feel terrible, but after not eating anything for the past days (except German chocolate), I figured I would at least try this.   So here's the [true] story: Student (of course), living in Canada (parents live in Michigan]. I am absolutely broke as my most recent funds were drained into parking tickets and a plane ticket for my brother's wedding.   I'm not going to complain that my situation is worse than anyone else's-- I have my sweet hamster asleep on my leg and I have season 4 of 30 Rock, so I'm bearing with it. *swallows pride* But I'm starving. If you're generous enough to send me pizza, give me your address and as soon as I have money for shipping I will send you out all the German chocolate I have, as well as a post card and a bag of Reeses Peanut Butter cups. I will do anything to make it even with you. And be your pen pal. :)  Thanks in advance. Seriously. 
593	False	a	Looking for something delicious for dinner. Payday is Friday, trying to stay fed till then!!
594	True	a	Made a throw away because I don't want my friends or family to know I'm short on cash atm. I hate asking for things, especially to my friends and family so I made this throw away to ask reddit instead. I am willing to provide my main account which is over a year old, requested once before but I also gave a pie in return as well.  Atm bit broke while waiting for work since school just finished and was hoping for a pizza. I of course plan to either return the favor to the person who sends it or will be posting up another offer in the next few days when my payment is confirmed from paypal and I have cash again while searching for work. 
595	False	a	Pittsburgh guy here, got a Papa John's near me.   Usually my parents would spot me some cash, but they've been withholding since they think I'm not trying to get a job. pls halp
596	False	a	I'm stuck on the Campus of Lee University in Cleveland, Tennessee with literally no money. I have a meager musical talent, and I would sing you a song if my computers microphone worked. I have no idea what else to offer. 
597	False	a	Pepperoni, and cheese is all we need no fancy toppings we are just hungry 
598	True	a	I have never really been one to ask for help, but my kids over rule my pride any day. I am the proud mother of four beautiful children: Aiden: 2 Cameron: 3 Olivia: 5 Joshua; 8 Recently we've had some bad times, my husband of 10 years kicked me and my children out after meeting a girl online, I have no family here and I don't really know anyone but the people I go to church with. My father is helping me out all he can he's paying for my room. I haven't had a job in 8 year but now I'm looking but there are very few jobs and I have to work around the churches day-care program I am food stamps Wednesday and the motel offers a free breakfast, but my children really deserve a pizza I mean their lives are completely changed and while their friends are going to see Harry Potter(mostly Josh) I can't afford anything like that's and I am Hoping maybe I can get some pizza to boost morale.  
599	True	a	"lately life just seems like there's no hope in sight...at a weird point in life. i left the girl of my dreams because my mom got sick with cancer and had to return to my hometown from living with her in japan. i get home, shit's fucked up, i can't do anything, she breaks up with me. i ended up going back to school to try and get a worthwhile degree (engineering, go figure) and thus spend all my time studying. I also have to work because i come from a fairly poor family and need to pay for an apartment close to campus (not to mention there's no room for me at any of my relative's houses). all my money goes to rent and other monthlys. i don't really have a supportive family, and the friends i thought i had in my city have left because ""i'm too much of a downer."" really supportive of them huh? now i just have really superficial relationships with the ones that were closest to me and i hate it...yeah, making stupid jokes is fun, but real friends should be there for each other, through anything.   tonight i'm studying for finals and i would really enjoy some decent food. i've never asked for anything like this but maybe the universe will smile upon me today? i promise to pay it forward, i know that energy flows in a circle. i am really grateful for everything i do have and i know that i'm a million times better off than 98% of the world...but still...suffering is relative to the individual, isn't it? if you can help i will be eternally grateful to you and will do anything i can for you or for another person later on.  thanks for looking"
600	True	a	Can you help make it a date night?  Here's the sitch (is that how you abbreviate it? I know how it's said, but I don't think I've seen it in writing....)  My girlfriend has been working hard to support us since I lost my job. Long hours, crappy boss, you know the drill.   About an hour ago I just got a short gig, so I can start to contribute again, but it will still be a while before we're back on our feet completely.  As I feel it is my boyfriendly duty, the least I can do for everything she does, I give her a lot of massages. Back, neck, arms, feet, I do it all baby! I'm rubbing those knots out like nobody's business.  But now my hands remind me of my grandpa's (except the skin doesn't look paper thin). Knuckles the size of cherries, stiff as a board. Ok so that's quite an exaggeration, they don't really hurt. But still.  I would love to be able to have a pizza tonight with her, as a sort of thank you type date thing, since we don't always get to eat together and it's never something you find on /r/FoodPorn  
601	True	a	My next paycheck wont come til friday the 16th.  Until then I have exactly $12.88 in my account to get gas to get me to work and food.  A pizza could easily feed me for 3+ days :)  I had an unexpected illness which left me out of work for some time and my job does not compensate for sick time.  Anyone willing to help a guy out?  I will be sure to pay it forward when I get back on my feet financially!
602	True	a	Having a rough night dealing with a good amount of things. Can't really manage cooking for myself, and don't have much of an appetite but need to force myself to eat something. Anyone help a girl out?  I could manage more details, but I'd rather not go into much. Mostly stress from dealing with legal stuff with my abusive ex and my son and trying non-stop to find myself a job with no avail.  Broke, obviously, but will pay it forward as soon as I can. Only have dominos in my area...thanks.
603	False	a	Today is my sons bday and right now I have no money whatsoever except a few dollars i gotta use for gas to get to my new job im starting next week. Hes turning 9 today and his name is Corvin. If anyone can help me out today with a pizza for him I'll be glad to pay it back when i get some money or my first check. Thank you all so much.    PS. Sorry I;m in KY btw
604	False	a	We're really hungry. Both of us are in college, and had a few bills to pay that are preventing us from eating anything other than cheezits and goldfish. I like both of those things, but I don't really feel like making a meal out of them. It makes me cringe thinking about it actually.   Anyway, we're trying to watch the new Game of Thrones tonight and we both agree a pizza is in order.   Hope you can help us out!  EDIT: I don't know if any of you have seen this video, but it pretty much sums up our desires. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wusGIl3v044   
605	False	a	Single mom, 2 kids, laid off, no food stamps yet, don't even have bread or milk...my life sucks. I feel like a shitty mom. 
606	True	a	I got left behind this year.  My brother went to his friend's house.  My parents went to New York.  I was told my sister would be having a Thanksgiving dinner at her apartment, but that didn't happen.  So now it's just me and my dog with the house to ourselves.  I got some Hot Pockets in the freezer, but it seems kind of sad to eat that on Thanksgiving.    Also, I guess I should include a location.  Santa Clarita, CA.
607	False	a	Recently broke up w/ my gf and sure its happened a few times before but I always have trouble making myself eat unless its right there in front of me, also I'm very broke, I think I have like 4 dollars.  Thanks you!
608	True	a	My fianc√©e is very hungry. She has had a really bad day at work. I want to be able to have something for her to be able to come home to that's good to eat, and be able to cheer her up. We're both beyond broke and no food left in our house.    We won't get paid again for another two weeks. We both work part time and living paycheck to paycheck right now. Trying to get back on track with our bills after I'd been out of work for close to two months. I'm hoping to be getting a second job as soon as I can get the call back to start. Catching up on our bills has left us completely broke.   I was wanting to try to get us a large pizza. Her favorite is Meat Lovers, but we'd greatly appreciate any kind. We live in Kentucky. As soon as we can get back on our feet, I promise to pay this forward and help someone that is in the same dire straits that we are currently going through.     
609	False	a	Hey RAoP. I've been pretty down lately, some dark thoughts been going through my head, I think a big part of that is my uncle (whom I live with) is suspected of having Bladder Cancer. I can't describe to you or put into context how unfortunate this is for our family, I mean cancer is usually horrible but on top of the hardship our family is facing this is absolutely devastating. My uncle, my mother, and me are supported by my grandmother. We all live in the same fairly small house, I'm the only one who has a (low wage retail) job and I'm working there and going to school so that soon I can get out of here alive, things are so stressful here. I usually wake up to people arguing and yelling at each other, my car needs a new transmission, I need tons of dental work, I really don't feel like going on a lot of the time but I stay positive and just try to reflect on the fact that I am working and making good grades.  So, I hope that didn't bore you, I didn't get too detailed. As for a pizza, if someone feels like getting me one that would be cool as I am broke until Friday, and we don't have much food here, also we have roaches so a lot of the food is contaminated. Ugh. A pepperoni + bell pepper pie from someone would really give me a little hope.  Thanks for reading...
610	False	a	I was in a recently (and abruptly) ended relationship, and my wallet is still at his house 200 miles away. I am back at my empty apartment with nothing to eat and no wallet. He won't respond to my calls or texts, and would have to send it via mail to return it to me. A simple pepperoni pizza would do wonders for me right now, and I fully plan to return the favor as soon as my wallet is returned to me.  Thank you for any consideration!
611	False	a	I use food stamps, and we ran out of them this month because of Christmas dinner. My fiance gets paid tomorrow, but tonight we don't have anything to eat. I have three small children too. One pizza would probably be enough, We would really appreciate it. Thank you and God bless.
612	False	a	...and I think the title pretty much says everything I can say about my sad and sad life. Haven't even left the house today. 
613	True	a	Who wants a pizza on Monday after a hard day at work? Help a guy out :)
614	False	a	We live in petaluma California and wont be able to get our foods stamps for another couple of weeks, a fresh pizza would cheer her up, random acts of kindness always cheers her up, Thank you and God Bless
615	False	a	If you can help I would greatly appreciate it. If not, I appreciate you reading this. Thanks!
616	False	a	It's been my toughest semester yet, having to work overtime just to pay basic bills (all of which I'm still behind on, of course) on top of going to school full time. My last final was yesterday and it would be nice to have some kind of reward!
617	False	a	No sad story or anything, just a broke college student (I have a part time job but most of the money goes to paying rent/food and paying down student loans early) who would love some pizza for dinner tonight. It is either the pizza or Cheerios with no milk for dinner. Help me out with either papa johns or dominos.  If someone gives me a papajohns gift card, I will use code that gives you the free pizza with an order of $10 and pay it forward in this subreddit tomorrow night!  THANK YOU!!!
618	True	a	I won my first free pizza from here the other day, but the person couldn't get any of the gift cards to go through. I was really dissapointed, so I though maybe another kind soul could cheer me up. I can give you proof of the situation as well, in case you don't believe me.
619	True	a	I really want to try this. I'll order a pizza and surprise my Mom when she gets home. If this works i'm gonna give back when I get cash!  Genral Location is Idaho. Thanks Reddit
620	True	a	This is my first time posting here after long lurking and it's kinda a long shot. I get paid on Tuesday but seeing how it's the first week of the month and all my payments are made I'm basically broke. If anyone can help that would be awesome.   Edit: I live in Miami, Florida
621	False	a	27 year old Air Force guy with a wife and 5 month old daughter. Bills came and took us from underneath. Will pay it forward as soon as I can.
622	False	a	"[](/pinkieawe ""no.. birthday party??"") It's my birthday and I don't get paid until tomorrow.   I thought it was going to be today, but direct deposit from my husband's new job hasn't kicked in yet so we have to wait for the physical check.  I'm not going to starve without a pizza or anything, in fact I have spaghetti leftovers in the fridge right now. Hubby's at work though and I have nothing to drink in the house other than tapwater and I'm battling a gnarly caffeine headache (tylenol is toning it down a bit but not completely). So if someone could get me a pizza and a 2liter of soda, I could get caught up on My Little Pony on Netflix and have a little pizza party to celebrate getting my new stuffed [Rainbow Dash](http://www.buildabear.com/shopping/productDetail.jsp?productId=prod11020066&amp;selectedParentCategoryId=cat110197&amp;categoryId=cat10760001&amp;dressMeMode=false) tomorrow.   [](/soawesome ""I get to go home with spazure tomorrow?! Is it MY birthday?!?!"")"
623	False	a	Pretty much exactly what it says in the title. I don't get paid for another two weeks, but I'm not starving. I could just really go for something pizza-like and maybe a 2-liter of soda to curl up on the couch with. :)
624	False	a	Tautological nom.
625	False	a	I am a broke ass college student (senior at Kennesaw State) and I won't be getting any money until the end of January. I'll probably be eating at the local shelter for the rest of the month. Would really just enjoy some good hot food tonight so that 2012 doesn't have to go out miserably in hunger. Thanks. Happy New Year! I hope 2013 brings great things to all you wonderful people.
626	False	a	so im broke (per usual) but this time im out of gas and spent the last few bucks on cat food... its not his fault im irresponsible w/ my money right? i tried to reach out to my wonderful friends on facebook, but as it turns out no one loves me as much as i thought they did. this is quite a sad day for me indeed. help a girl out, order me a pizza? i'd even take thai delivery... that would make this the best day ever, let me tell ya.  dc metropolitan area...

629	False	a	Not sure whether this is working with germany or not... but yea I'm pretty very short on money, everyone in my area is celebrating Germany in the Euro 2012, can't even afford to do that atm. A pizza could do good things for me now. :=)
630	False	a	Living on my own for the first time, Bills are a bitch, pizza would really cheer me up and put a smile on my face. 
631	False	a	Hello RAOP'ers, I'm Galus and I'm from Clearwater, FL. I've been spending my time sitting around hungry for the past couple of days and broke for the last two months. My friend &amp; fellow redditor /user/stevenjohns/ told me about Random Acts of Pizza and I thought I might give this a shot, what can I lose, my pride? School is starting next week and I'm trying to stretch out the last of my money till my scholarships and grants come. Because I've been broke, i've been staying in doing nothing but coding and gaming. I don't know what much more to say other than this is me: http://mariuszgalus.com , in the past week i've been trying to help out my dad's business (not going well) by redo-ing his entire site http://bmhardwoodfloors.net AND my new site (cool css3 stuff! ) http://mariuszgalus.com/newsite which I can't wait to deploy. I also have been coding for 64labs.com but the CEO told me he had no money to pay me. I thought it was my big break to getting a job. In the end, i'm hungry. I just signed up for EBT/food stamps. -_-  Here's a picture of my bank account http://twitch.tv/saionjik  Have a good day guys
632	False	a	Hello guys, This time of the year is really rough on me, I had to find a 6 month long internship. I found it but I used all my monies on stamps, letters bus tickets and calls (200 places called woohoo !). I could use a tasty tasty pizza tonight (it's ~9pm right now in France). I posted another sumission 2 hours ago and it seems that it ended up in the spam filter, let me know if I should delete this one. Have a great day !
633	True	a	I just got home.  Checked my mail.  One lone piece in the box.  A very recognizable SASE.  In it, nicely folded in thirds, was my divorce decree.  Nothing else, just a little certificate.  I know what it is, but I read it over anyway, cause hey, it hurts more if you let the words fully sink in.    Yesterday was my birthday.  One day you're 36, the next day you're divorced.  Not that I had many choices, but I was going to cook dinner tonight.  Now I don't want to do anything.    I had to borrow $100 today to cover all the checks I mailed out on the first including rent.  I don't get paid until next week.  The divorce wasn't cheap, and now I get to officially make her payments every month.  The fun never ends.  I thought hey, I'll just get a pizza.  Oh wait no, my life is a mess and I have no money.  If anyone can help me out, I'll be sure to do the same for someone next week.  If not, just tell me it's going to get better.
634	False	a	well, My mom is out of town and wont be back for a few more days. . . I had quite a bit of cereals and breads and various boxed foods to last me, and 5 days ago EVERYTHING Got completely infested with bugs.  all the food was pretty much garbage and not safe to eat and I had to get a friend to come help me throw everything out and spray the house down and try to kill all these fuckers off...  but now I have no food, and no money (Bank account is -7328 overdrafted D: ) and I haven't eaten in days. . .  Any generosity would be nice. doesn't even have to be a pizza. Any food delivered would be nice... I'm in canada. I know most food places have cheap salads and various other things.. Anything would be appreciated and i promise to pay it forward as soon as I have money to do so or the chance to! D: ... thanks for your time...
635	False	a	Wasnt really sure what to put as the title, uni student, recently moved interstate (Victoria australia to Queensland australia) am running a little low on funds till wednesday, was hoping maybe a kind stranger could order me a pizza and i can return the favour on wed?
636	True	a	2 more days until payday and my man and I are starving! Anyone care to help us out? We'll gladly return the favor on Thursday when he gets paid! We've been reading through these stories and you folks are the best, glad to see that someone out there still has a heart for people far worse off than us!  edit: Forgot our location, we're in Austin texas!!

FWIW, i was actually laid off by the executives, not fired for incompetence.  My wife is out of town and she doesn't even know yet.  It's just me and my 3 kids hanging out tonight.  Anyone feel like sending a few medium pizzas our way?  The thank you pictures will be marvelous indeed.  Of course I can't show our faces, since the IAMA is rather incriminating... :)  I'm not proud, but I'm not ashamed!   edit:  It'll be [hot dogs and blueberry bagels](http://i.imgur.com/k2SlM.jpg) if nobody wants to help this worthless secadmin in another 30 min or so.  After that, I'll just delete this post. Last thing I need is to have more eyes gandering at that AMA when I start job hunting! :) 2nd edit:  well I'll call it for tonight.  I sincerely appreciate anyone that read this and considered Randoming a pizza to me, even if you decided against it.  Just the thought is worth it in my book.  We ate some dogs and bagels so we're g2g for tonight.  Thanks so much to everyone.   **EDIT:  I withdraw my request for a pizza.  There's others that deserve it more.  The fact that I was paid for a job that I was horrible at does make me feel like I shouldn't be asking for a pizza.  My family and I will be fine.  i appreciate all the offers.  **  **I ask that if you really were going to get me a pizza today, you instead get one for ""halohoppe"".  He obviously has such low opinions of majority of humanity that I think everyone would be better off if his faith was restored slightly. I'll admit I was upset when he posted twice about what a scumbag I am, and how I just like free shit, but he's right.  I do like free shit, and I was paid to be in a job that i was not fit for.  i had other duties and continued to work, and had a great boss who was more of a friend.  I have no reason to feel sorry for myself..  Please, get a pizza for halohoppe.  Maybe it will motivate him to pass it forward and actually earn that pizza slice next to his username before bashing others**"
638	False	a	So my husband and i are so far into the red in our bank account its ridiculous from helping our friends who decided to visit and their card stopped working. Now its Monday after noon and I'm working on my novel craving a pizza. Anyone feel like helping? We'll pay it forward and confirm what ever you want from us.
639	False	a	Hey y'all.  So, I live in Fort Worth TX. I'm shuttered in my room tonight doing homework and studying. I won't be asleep till at least 4 at the earliest and I just need some food to scarf down while I go over these kanji and sentence structures. Any help is appreciated! :D
640	True	a	Broke ass-college student here; got paid 10 days ago and all of my paycheck went to rent and bills. I've got no groceries in the house and all my roommates are back home for the summer. No gas in the car and the bike's out of commission :(. If any kind redditor could hook me up I'd be able to eat for two days :D  google maps link to domino's in my area http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=10239146004443176581&amp;q=domino's+pizza,+chico,+ca&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=39.722827,-121.848776&amp;sspn=0.012468,0.024856&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=39.733066,-121.864429&amp;spn=0,0&amp;z=15   EDIT: oh, and of course: I'll be pizzaing it forward when my paycheck comes next month. this is a ridiculously cool subreddit.
641	False	a	Hey, we just got home, we are tired, hungry and my Mom is out working late. There is nothing in the fridge, I get paid tomorrow and I swear I will pay it forward. Thanks so much!
642	False	a	I have the post-festival blues despite being accompanied by my boyfriend and a bunny fairy in a sexy tu-tu. Please fill the gaping void of sadness beneath my boobs with some glorious, glorious pizza so i may convince my boyfriend the bunny fairy is real and that we wasted (/not wasted) one of the wishes on pizza.
643	False	a	Just a normal guy here that is low on cash (no more then $30 to last me the rest of the month) and is craving some pizza.  Since I'm in Sweden it might be a bit tricky but I do have a paypal account. I've been thinking about buying someone a pizza here for a while and I'll be sure to return the favor as soon as I get my paycheck :).  Cheers guys.
644	False	a	It's been a rough summer here. It may be cold in the D but it's pretty cold in Flint Town too. My roommate totaled his car, we were living five deep in here paying 100/person in rent and 3/5 roommates moved out this week.  We are both unemployed at the moment, I just got hired in somewhere but I won't get paid  for another two weeks.  We are kind of shitting bricks about what we are going to eat.  All of our money is going to utilities, and to pay rent.  If there is a kind redditor out there who could extend some sort of relief my roommate and I would be so incredibly grateful.  We just need a little bit of relief until we can get some food assistance.
645	False	a	"The Wednesday before Christmas I was fired from my job.  I previously worked for major corporations and moved to an independent computer repair company because I thought it would be a better opportunity.  After my first two weeks I noticed that some less than ethical and legal things were happening.  I saw the companies 40 + year old head tech go through a teenage girls picture file because he thought she was attractive and also the company wasn't following labor laws.  I raised a concerns because I could have been held liable for some of the issues that were happening.  A few days later I was fired, the reason was ""You don't fit in with our company"".  I'm looking for another job and until then repairing computers for friends, but a random act of pizza would defiantly help restore my faith in humanity.  I know my account is new, but I can easily give you proof that I am legit.  I suppose in the long run I may not have a job, but I do have my ethics.  "
646	False	a	Panama City, FL: We are very low food at the moment I have 1 pack of pork chops left till we get out food stamps on the 5th. I was hoping to find a pizza hero for today, the kids are tired of oddles and noodles. We have Dominoes, Pizza Hut, Hungry Howies, all that deliver here. (I dont have a working car). Two large pies will serve lunch and dinner for us. Please consider our family, thank you. Stay blessed.
647	False	a	Would greatly appreciate it, sucks seeing her so bummed out.
648	False	a	Will pay it forward on the 28th when I get paid. Thanks in advance. Can also do some minor photoshop work for you if you need. (I need the practice anyways). Any other questions feel free to ask. 
649	False	a	Hey guys! First time requester...Long story short, my job hates me and my roomies are asshats. Can anyone suggest a great way to end the evening?
650	False	a	All out of bread for PB&amp;J. I get paid on Friday. Can anyone help me out? I'm going to basically just starve until Thursday Midnight. Help hold me over please.
651	True	a	Helloooo, I just got my wisdom teeth taken out on Monday and they were killing me for about two weeks prior to that. All of that equates to me not having eaten anything other than soup for almost three weeks :( I am finally feeling better and really want to eat something real, but being that I'm a bartender and haven't been able to work for over a week, I haven't made any tips that can help me with said food. To add to that, I would love to share requested pizza with my boyfriend, since he's had to deal with my drugged up whiny ass for a week, and it'd be a nice treat for him. If anyone's willing to help, we'd love to pay it forward within the next few weeks.. Thanks so much!
652	False	a	"I will be moving out of town soon, and this is one of the last days that I'll be able to hang out with my amazing group of friends here in Tallahassee. We're all broke at the moment, and moving isn't cheap. A pizza would be a great ""last meal"" for us.  I will repay someone in need when I can afford it.  Thanks for your time"
653	False	a	I am really craving some Hawaiian or bbq chicken and avocado pizza
654	False	a	Today while on a 5-6 hour hike, We returned to the city and I came home realizing that my ID'S Debits and all of that good stuff did not make it back with me and being in a new place this month the fridge and cupboards have nothing in them. Accept for a pouch of taco seasoning which might be ok but...   Sadly being 10:43pm I cannot get my bank stuff figured out. I do not want it for free I most defiantly want to barter here  is a list of things I can provide. -Pay it forwards once cards renewed -Write you a personalized poem (Hand written and shipped by request) - Anything graphic design or audio engineering related  - a print of some of my art work (Sent by request) - or anything you can come up with that I'm able.  I have never done this before I'm curious to see the outcome Cheers :)
655	False	a	I'm staying up all night to get a headway on an assignment about soil (duller than dull) which will be one of the last papers I write before I graduate this May with (hopefully) a sparkly lovely degree. Naturally my body has decided I need to suffer and has bestowed me with the finest  mind-numbing-no-breathing-allowed-just-give-up-already head cold it could muster. I refuse to give in! Pizza will be my salvation. 
656	False	a	Used up all my food bank visits for the month and have next to nothing to eat for the remainder of the month. Would someone be kind enough to help a brother out.?
657	False	a	hi im andrew, jobs have been hard to come by and im in school so im busy. if someone could buy me a pizza, id likely return the favor once i have the cash...guranteed i will :D im hungry so please help. thank you very much
658	False	a	We are 5 broke freshmen at Champlain college, living in a 5 man room, we missed dinner due to class and could really uses some pizza. 
659	False	a	Hello there. I'm not thrilled about asking, but myself, my roommate, and my girlfriend are quite hungry. The three of us have a class through dinner on Tuesdays/Thursdays, and this week, there's just nothing left in our fridge to cook, and none of us gets paid until tomorrow.  If any redditors are around and would like to donate a pizza to our cause, we'd be very thankful! 
660	False	a	I'm not starving, or without income. I'm a little broke right now, but there's definitely food in the pantry. But you know what? It's all healthy food. And fuck that. I just really want a pizza. Or as Dr. Steve Brule would say, a prizza. **It makes me really fucking happy.** See? Look at this pic of me eating pizza! Look how happy I was in that moment! http://i.imgur.com/kDS2u.jpg You, good sir or madame, could make me that happy again. It is within your power! Plus I'd probably take a bunch of photos of myself LOSING MY SHIT over the pizza. It'd be really undignified and manic. 
661	False	a	perhaps too long of a title seeing how that covers it all pretty much. 
662	False	a	Work wouldn't give me the day off so my band could play a show so I called out day of and was fired. Not the smartest decision but a pizza would make me feel much better about it
663	False	a	I just have no money at all to help them but they could really use an unexpected happy moment! We have rice and beans and will not starve,but the kids honestly hate the same meal again and again. I will have the oppurtunity to pass the pizza along in a couple weeks when things have grown more stable here. Not sure how exactly to verify as I have no camera but please feel free to message me!
664	False	a	Hello~    I am a broke college student and I am currently craving some pizza!  It would be awesome to eat tonight without putting myself even further into debt with my student loans.  Also, pizza is delicious!  I would be glad to repay you by way of silly pictures or chiptunes.     Thanks for reading my post~   
665	False	a	So I have never done this before, but i'm pretty desperate.  I am at school today with no money until tomorrow.  I have class in like 2 hours and i need to eat something.  I haven't had anything all day unfortunately.  there was nothing at my apartment to eat when I left for school either.  If there is anyone on here who can help, i will promise to return the favor to someone else in need.  thanks again for reading this, and hopefully helping me out. :)
666	False	a	"I found this community through [another post](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/iphuy/during_an_illness_a_friend_recommended_reddit_to/) and thought it sounded pretty ludicrous, so I figured I would check it out. I pop in, read through the sidebar and notice this tidbit:  ""Requestors, please be COMPLETELY HONEST about your circumstances. We don‚Äôt mind multiple requestors or asking for pizza just for fun or asking for any reason.""  Darn interesting, I figured that the community here would be completely against people who are not starving and out of cash requesting pizza, but I absolutely fucking love pizza, so here I am testing it out  Again, being completely upfront, I am not in any ridiculous need for pizza, besides my undying love for it. I pay my bills every month, I have a decent lump of money saved up in the bank, all is going pretty well, but here is the request anyways!  Oh almost forgot, here is my verification code: ZkmSFEfYfT6b  EDIT: Forgot my general area as well, Detroit Metro area!"
667	False	a	Hello there! I just moved to a new city and unfortunately have not been able to find either a job or a place to live. My last bit of money was spent on gas this morning so I won't have anything to eat until the 10th of November when I finally receive my food stamps. A cheese pizza would be amazing right about now and much gladly appreciated ^_^! It's just myself and my little dog so at times things get discouraging when there's no one else around, this being one of those times.
668	False	a	"Not real sure what to say here. I'm a single mom of 3, recently unemployed and trying to scrape by till I can get another job. I don't want to post a ""sob story"" type of thing so I'll keep it short. I'm broke, we are hungry, and a pizza would be awesome. Thanks. :)"
669	False	a	I live in the UK, and my brother has recently moved to Dubai. I recently made a facebook post saying I was getting pizza, and asking who else wanted some. My brother said he was in, and I intend to fulfil his request. I did try to get him the pizza myself, but I couldn't find any pizza places in Dubai that did online ordering, and I couldn't call them because I don't speak Arabic. Help me, Random Acts of Pizza, you're my only hope!
670	False	a	Alright Reddit, I'll be straight. I'm not super desperate for food. If someone else says they're on their last legs and need a pie, go take care of them first. By the time I get paid I will definitely not be starving or any such thing. But a man can only sustain on 20 cent ramen for so long before he goes crazy.  Money's Friday. You do me a solid on this, Reddit, and I'll soon reciprocate with a delicious start to your weekend.  E-gifts would be preferred (if I am allowed to say?). THANKS TTYL.
671	True	a	I just paid my rent with the last of my financial aid money from last semester and Im sick and tired of eating canned meals. I feel like I'm a survivor of the apocalypse. Would a kind redditor help me out with a cheese pizza. More than willing to pay it forward when I'm in a better position.
672	False	a	Just ran out of groceries and could use a pizza
673	False	a	"My mother and little sisters land lord left a note on their door stating that if they don't pay their current and late rent amount in 2 days that they will be evicted. The landlord is always really lenient with my mother so it's understandable and pretty predictable that this would eventually happen due to how far my mother got behind. I immediately went to the bank, withdrew every dime I had, got a money order and took it to their land lord.   I did this fully aware that I'd be without and with no regrets. My mother and sister having a roof over their head is far more important then me going a couple days without food. I have a well paying job and I'm rarely home which explains why I have no food in my refrigerator. I help people out whenever I get the chance. However, My belly is really screaming ""fuck you"" at the moment.. So it would be pretty rad if someone could loan me the money for a pizza. I get paid Monday, and I'm a lady of my word so you can best believe this will be paid back or paid forward.   The throwaway account is because I don't ask for help, I just don't. It's embarrassing and a touchy situation so I'd rather hide behind a bitch account. Growing up we were always needing help with something, and I really don't like asking for help.. However if someone is willing to help I WILL give you my account name, I can even give you my mothers number so you can verify this."
674	False	a	Friends, countrymen, Redditors!  Lend me your ears!  NW Arkansas  A group of 3 people who don't have enough money to get food would like a pizza.  Verification ready.  Also, you will get a cameo in my first All Flesh Must Be Eaten role playing game.  Love,  Glistening Dragon 
675	True	a	Recently had lots of unexpected school related expenses come up, leaving me with 3 bucks in my account. Would love a pizza to break up the monotony of ramen/walmart canned lasagna/rice. I can provide proof, and will pay it forward as soon as I can (probably the check after this next one). Thanks.
676	False	a	I smashed my finger under a milk crate at work and I am unable to work right now but I will get workmans comp friday. But till them im at home with pain meds but no food to take with it. A pizza will hold me over til friday. Any help would be appreciated and reciprocated friday.
677	False	a	Hey whats up everyone. my name is John and ive been in dcf since i was three. i am now 18 and attending a community college here in New Haven ,CT and since i am 18 i finally get my own place that im very thankful DCF helps pay for. the only thing is that IM HUNGRY. my case worker is suppose to give me money for food. but she has yet to come and i havent heard from her in the past few days. i pizza would be awesome at this point. so if anyone could help please let me know. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE! HAVE A AWESOME DAY AND HAPPY 4TH OF JULY.
678	True	a	I'm at the library right (sigh) now and probably will be all night until my final at 8:45am tomorrow. I barely have money to buy food from my college, but a pizza would go a long way in helping me concentrate for this final. I will pay it back once I have get money it to my account.   Edit: Just looked at my title *nods in shame* 
679	False	a	Been driving solo from Florida to LA since May 15th, camping in forests and national parks and crashing on people's couches when I can. Mostly eating canned food and boxed stuff like cereal and granola bars. I'm in Phoenix right now and would really love a piping hot pizza.
680	True	a	hey again, tonight i'm super hungry! this week i've been living off of 12$ buying ramen and eating it twice a day, and frankly i feel kind of malnourished. I've got to make it until sunday, and it would really help to have a pie! :) !
681	False	a	Was wondering if someone could spread some randomness around?   I'm quite hungry and i haven't got a thing to fix to eat and was wondering if i could see about getting a pizza  *edit spellings 
682	False	a	I just had to slap down two full paychecks for a rental house deposit so this week has been clear out the fridge/freezer time. Unfortunately I've already run out of things to eat. :( I could easily make a medium pizza last me for lunches at work till payday, when I fully intend on returning the favor for anyone else who is in the same temporary bind that I am. Even if I don't get a pizza!  Gotta say I just learned about this subreddit a few days ago and this is an amazing system everyone's got going here. The standup folks outnumber the scumbags by a lot, and I want to jump in and give back to such a giving small community as soon as I'm able.
683	False	a	It's been nearly 3 days without a proper meal. I'd really appreciate it if somebody could provide me with a pizza, and I can promise that Monday (when I finally receive some money) I will be helping another user :).  I don't care what food really, I'm just starving right now. 
684	False	a	Hi there. I am in the West Palm Beach, FL area. My family is struggling severely. We have gotten to the point that we need to go to a food bank tomorrow to be able to feed myself, my husband, my disabled sister and my toddler. I would literally be forever grateful if someone would be kind enough to give us a helpful hand to get through tonight. We are out of options.  Thank you so much...
685	False	a	I really really really hate asking for things, especially from strangers. I lost a bunch of hours on my last check, and have been surviving on the 4 dollars u had left after rent, ramen is nasty. If you want to help someone out, this guy is desperate for some protein. Thank you even if you don't help.    Edit. I am in Peoria illinois, if that helps. I am also down to walk to your house and clean for food at this point in the day if you live in ptown. 
686	True	a	Title says it all... I had some unexpected expenses today that drained me of my money for the rest of the week. Haven't eaten since I had a cup of yogurt about 13 hours go and I'm startin' to feel it. If anyone is able to help me out with a small pepperoni I'd truly appreciate it, and if you're into gaming I can shoot you an invite to DotA 2!  
687	True	a	He's never heard of Reddit and I just introduced him to it tonight.. I told him not to blame me for the amount of procrastinating he will do this week.  
688	False	a	3 girls and one boy, and they've vocally already showed their disdain of eating the standard fare of ramen and more ramen that i always serve. 
689	False	a	i don't know how this works...but pay check isn't coming in till Monday. no money now and a pizza would be awesome for the spirits.  
690	False	a	I actually have money for the pizza but all I have is a 50 dollar bill, and the delivery boys don't accept anything larger than a 20 dollar bill.
691	False	a	Hey all,   I'm afraid I don't really have a story.  My roommates and I take turns buying groceries for the week.  This week is their week, but they are out of town seeing family.  The kitchen is very empty.  Obviously, they'll make it up to me upon their return, but until that time I am on my own.   Unfortunately, I don't get paid from my regular job until Friday (and those of you who might recognize my username know I generate no income from my YouTube/Twitch channels), and the truth is I just can't afford to go grocery shopping until then.  I am almost positive I can make what I have left stretch to Friday, but if anyone is feeling generous I would be most appreciative for any assistance.   Looking back, I guess that kind of is a story.  Sorry about that.   -Pounce
692	False	a	typical hungry college student stuck at home without money. I just got a job but I probably won't get paid until another week. I will pay you back or pay a pizza forward if you wish!
693	False	a	I'm just a hungry college student, not much more to say! 
694	False	a	Hey guys, I haven't quite gotten on my feet (i.e. found employment) after spending the summer on the road before my band broke up a couple months ago.  I'm sitting in an empty apartment with a laptop and a can of cream of shrimp soup.  (Oh ramen, how I miss you.)   SOOOOO, if someone would be kind enough to help me out with a delicious pizza, I'd be more than happy to write and record a little ditty thanking them.  Not that that's worth much, but...it'd be fun?
695	False	a	I would enjoy if someone would order me a just a totally plain cheese pizza from papa johns. Uhm I'm just really hungry and don't get paid till tomorrow so I would like to eat today haha. I don't know what else to say this is my first time you know. Oh yeah you might want to know that I'm from Texas. You can just order online. :)
696	True	a	Just your average broke college student looking for some pizza lovin'. I only have 5 weeks before school is over but I'm not doing so hot financially. Hopefully I'll get to work two jobs over the summer. I vow to pay it forward if I do receive some pizza.  I'm currently working on mock-ups for a project. (design student)  -8245a
697	False	a	I would appreciate this so much! I have no idea when an interview will work out and I definitely will pizza someone else in the future! 
698	False	a	I only have 3 days until I'm done exams and I'm getting to the last of my food (will run out today) and money for the term(down to $10). I am hoping that one of my fellow redditors will add a little pizzazz to my diet with some pizza. I'm from Ontario Canada and go to the University of Waterloo and major in Math, so if you need any help there I can help you out in exchange. 
699	False	a	Due to some error at work which was found too late for anything to be done about it, I won't be getting paid until mid January. Naturally as well as all the Christmas expenses, my car decided that this would be a good time to need repair work and everything else, so I'll be spending Christmas here with the dog.  I'm not going to be starving or anything as I do have food in the freezer, but I could really do with a pizza at the moment and it would be very much appreciated!
700	False	a	Hey, just moved into a new place that needed a lot of TLC, would greatly appreciate something to eat as I dont get paid until Thursday. What money I did have went into some cleaning supplies to help make this place livable.  Ohio here, Vermilion to be exact.
701	False	a	"My girlfriend's going in to hospital midday tomorrow for a certain ""procedure"", which means as of this morning she's fasting and only permitted to consume clear liquids. I'm unfortunately out of work and in recent weeks she's been working hard to support the both of us and I'm really grateful and proud of her and would love to treat her once this is over tomorrow evening, but the sad fact is that I simply can't afford to do so. Help me to give her a small treat that I feel she deserves.      Picture of the lovely meds that she's got to take in preparation for tomorrow:   http://i.imgur.com/64OR9.jpg"
702	False	a	I'm kind of having a terrible day. Basically, last night I went out, got drunk, and drunk texted an ex-boyfriend that I had just recently become friends with. He told my best friend, who basically told me that he was uncomfortable and I need to leave him alone. Obvious pro-tip: don't keep your phone nearby if you're drunk.   Anyway, I'm an idiot and I feel like crap and I'm a little low on cash because I have to move apartments in the middle of next month, so I have to put down rent on both places. It means a lot of nights playing Fable and eating fruit cocktail. A pizza would really help me get through the day. I've given before - and I hate asking - but I would be so, so grateful if I could get one. 
703	False	a	Umm, I'm hungover as hell, hungry as hell and poor as hell. I don't really have anything to give, but I do have a free copy of Europa Universalis 3 with all of the addons etc I can gift via steam if anyone would like it!
704	True	a	Hey Raop,  I recently got a job as a Standardized Patient, yay. But its been about a month since my last job as a camp counselor and funds are low and the tummy is growling.  I won't lie, I'm not out of food, I could go and eat some beans and rice again for the 5th night in a row but I kinda want to mix it up.   Someone wanna help me out?  -dbrownbear
705	True	a	Tomorrow I am moving home and it is a scrape to do but for health reasons I have to move away from this particular home. I have no money to buy food until Thursday (I get paid then).  Hopefully someone will be able to help me out tonight if not then thanks anyway.   Sadly getting to the point where I only have a couple hours left to do anything ( I have to get to bed early ish so I can get up early to move. If I can get anyone to help in the next 2 hours or 3 that would be awesome.   Well thanks anyways guys :). It was a long shot but thanks. Even though I didnt get pizza's it dont matter 
706	False	a	My girlfriend decided it would be a good idea to get off at Perth bus station when she was coming to visit me and has since had to spend all her money on a taxi to get to me here in Dundee. Any chance some kind soul would get us some pizza since we don't have any cash anymore?
707	True	a	I don't even know if this is allowed, because I technically don't want pizza. I do want chocolate lava cake from dominos.   I was due with my husband and I's daughter last Friday. The same day, I had to take my husband to the airport for a week of training. We tried so hard to get out of it, but that's the life in the military.  I honestly could get up and bake some cookies or something, but I am trying to stay in a reclined position. I'm trying to get my contractions to slow down until my husband gets home tomorrow night.  
708	False	a	thx bros
709	False	a	Couldn't make it to the doctor or bank because of yet another panic attack. Just need something to get through the day and make another try tomorrow, y'know?
710	False	a	Hi     We're moving today and with fronting for the new deposit, paying for tuition at Davis, and double rent...we're tapped out. We have already had issues today- budget screwed up our rental truck and we had to drive 30 miles away to pick up a replacement and our new apt was dirty so now we are waiting on a cleaning service to sort that out! We got two friends to help us (with 2 kids I can't help my husband much) but we need to feed them! Could somebody help us out with a couple of pizzas today?
711	False	a	My wife and I really miscalculated and I didn't realize payday for me is not until the 15th which is a tuesday. We'd really appreciate something to get us through the weekend. 
712	False	a	Wondering if anybody could help me out! Would pass on the favor this week!
713	True	a	Some bills took me by suprise and now I am poorer than ever, so I was hoping you could help me with a pizza.  I bought the humblebundle ( A lot of games ) recently so I can give you a game for your pizza ( Dead Space, Medal of Honor, Crysis 2, Burnout Paradise )  Edit: oohh... cakeday :)  Thank you for reading.
714	False	a	The last week has been very tumultuous, at least by my standards. I had to deal with writing several papers for school while treating head lice, the water and internet being shut off, and very little patience. Life has certainly picked up a bit.  The water has been turned back on, the head lice has been treated, but I'm still stuck writing several papers, babysitting, and working with a limited food supply. I'm not trying to create a sob story, it's just how things are at the moment. I do plan on giving pizza in the future when I am able. Heck maybe I could even give back to you.  My roommate's daughter is at the sitters for the night, we're getting ready to watch some really bad movies while I work on some papers. We'd like to celebrate the fact that she just gained employment and passed a test. Please help me out so I don't have to live off of one box of rice and a very limited supply of coffee.  
715	False	a	i donate plasma weekly all tapped out for this week so when i donate next week ill pay it forward on here located in phoenix btw
716	False	a	Broke. Been broke, I'm with two of my buddies, we all got out of school a few months ago and are stuck in the void of trying to start a career with a mound of student loan debt :( Spent the last 5 dollars on cat food, could someone send us a pizza so we can eat too?
717	True	a	My boyfriend's mom has been hinting at the fact that she would like to have a lap dog to keep her company.  Boyfriend and I find the perfect one and spend the last of our cash for the week to get it We. bring it over to surprise her with it and her controlling boyfriend says she can't have the dog because he didn't get her for it.  So now we have a sweet new puppy to find a home for, and no money.  Not to mention that my boyfriend is devastated by this (he doesn't know I am posting).  Pizza would help boost his crushed spirit.  TL:DR Tried to surprise boyfriend's mom with dog she wanted, got denied by her controlling boyfriend. Boyfriend devastated.
718	False	a	My girlfriend and i got kicked out a little over a week ago from our apartment after we both lost our jobs working with the portland water bureau ...i have eaten a half of a sandwich at my friends house 2 days ago and got some free water at mcdonalds and stuff over the last few days... but in a week we have really eaten nothing and we are house sitting for a friend. He is offering to give us both $20 for a 3 day house sit,But he doesnt get paid till Saturday, and there is no food in this house, (2 pieces of stale bread that we ate) its our first night and we have no money. I was using my friends internet at his house looking for jobs and i cam upon an email from a friend who works with children with special needs, and he gave me the URL to this website. So i am hoping anyone who has a kind heart to feed an honest hard working man and girlfriend for a night or two would be willing to help us out with some pizza. Thanks in advances.
719	True	a	I've been eating nothing but ramen and *extremely* cheap frozen dinners for the past three weeks (jobless, looking.) and it'd just be nice to eat something that rises above the blandness of my current diet. I'm in Tucson, AZ and there's both a dominos and a pizza hut by my house.  EDIT: Pastafarian sent me a generous dominoes gift card (I'll be sure to get pizza with my youngest brother (he's in summer school and his hours at work have been cut) all this week :) ) and Bluehairedfreak ordered a delivery before he/she got my message regarding pastafarian so I got pizza for tonight as well. Thank you so much to both of you; you're great people.
720	False	a	Hi. I recently got dumped and am feeling really low, as is my wallet. Would love to have some comfort food to fill a bit of the hole I'm feeling. 
721	False	a	I live on a very tight budget and the ends just didn't meet this month.  A pizza and the bit of ramen and rice I have left will hold me over until the end of the month.  I am currently in training at a local waffle house.  I will be cooking eventually, but I'm training on tables for now.  Unfortunately, male waiters don't make tips for squat around this area.  My last $20 (mostly quarters) is to be used to drive from Jackson, to Vicksburg, and back so I can visit my dad for Thanksgiving.
722	False	a	Lost my job a few months ago and finding anything halfway steady has been hard to say the least. Finally starting a new job soon and would love to celebrate with a real meal. I'm good and video editing and programming so if you need anything in that field I can assist!   Thanks for reading!
723	False	a	I had a room to myself, but now I have a roommate. I just really want some pizza to break the ice.
724	True	a	You know how it is - end of the month, all the money's been committed, stuck at work and everyone else is eating awesome lunch stuff and you've got nothing but the earlier resolve to just drink water at lunch until payday...which is seeming less satisfying by the minute.  If granted a joyful pizza, I'll be offering a pizza on the 16th in return, because that's how I (pizza) roll.  ETA: whether today, tomorrow, or Wednesday, doesn't matter. I'll be working through lunch, so time is also flexible (say...by 3pm on any of those days). Thanks for your consideration!
725	False	a	I am currently unemployed was relocated to this small town and then downsized. Things are tough. There is a Pizza Hut in this small town and if someone was kind enough it would be appreciated.
726	False	a	Well, it's my first time on this subreddit, and I wish I was giving.  Unfortunately though I was able to pay off my rent, I don't have any money until Friday to buy groceries or anything similar.  It would really help me out if I could get some pizza to munch on while studying tonight.  Thanks if you can. Have a great upcoming Thankgiving everyone!
727	False	a	In addition to getting my wallet stolen over the weekend, I miss living somewhere I can afford to eat a pizza. It would be really super if there was a generous heart out there! :)
728	True	a	Hi im the Mom of 5 One is on his own im home with the other 4....... ages are 3,5,13,15 We are on One income , we dont ever eat out at anywhere, smallest is Autistic and Loves LOVES pizza he dont talk alot, but he sure can say hot dogs and pizza =) we have noodles and mac and cheese ect, but he keeps saying pizza so i thought i would throw this out there and see if anyone would get the kids a pizza, i dont need any for me but they would love it , im in lewis center ohio zip code is 43035.

729	False	a	"Dear Reddit, i posted earlier but i didnt put request in the title so it was removed. Here is my second attempt. So, today i finally met my first in person redditor and i have to say, it was amazing. (ive been a lurker since the whole Digg v4 fiasco, but i decided to make an account a few days ago so i can be somebody in this community for once. Anyway, she told me about this subreddit where if youre hungry, short on cash, or are willing to meet some sort of requirement, someone will order you a pizza. So heres my shot. Basically im pretty broke at the moment. I live with a roommate but i really dont want to go through her fridge and be ""that guy"" who eats what he wants even if it isnt his. I make minimum wage (30hrs a wekk) in my state but luckily i work about 3 miles away so i dont spend much on fuel. I have 3 children and i was divorced almost a year ago. About half my monthly income goes to child support and random bills (i was an idiot and got a title loan at a desperate time in my life and i still have to pay a pretty hefty monthly payment for a few more months. My state says i make too much to receive food stamps so i have to pay for all my food with cash and also food for when i get my children on the weekends (i want to make sure they have 3 good healthy meals a day when theyre here). so heres where i ask, Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, will you please buy me some pizza, im sure it will be left overs and help me out through out the week until im payed on friday. im willing to do whatever tasks im needed to earn this pizza. I love Reddit and all it stands for, especially subreddits like these (assistance, suicidewatch) I live in Idaho if that helps any fellow Idahoan Redditors. Thanks Reddit."
730	False	a	I've been really craving a pizza.  Don't have the money, and that's a story for another day.  Today's story is this.  I have four general admission lawn seats to the Rockstar Enery Mayhem festival featuring Disturbed, Godsmack, and Megadeth.  The show is today in West Palm Beach at the Cruzan Amphitheater.  I'm trying to give them away.  If someone wants to throw a pizza my way, that's awesome.  If not, that's cool too.  Would love to be able to give back to someone who has been helping others, so verified givers will be given preference.  Obviously this is short notice, but they are electronic tickets and I will send them to you right away.    Hope someone can use them.  
731	False	a	I'm a student out at Texas Tech and unfortunately I now have no way to pay for pizza or any other type of food. Please PM me for more details.
732	False	a	Or it could be an attempt at induction into the order of pizza I guess. 
733	False	a	I live in Texas and I'm really hungry. I would appreciate any help I can get. 
734	False	a	Hey guys, me and my friend Taylor are both in bed sick. I have a pretty shitty cold, and she has strep throat. We both have a plethora of finals to study for Our dining hall, not that we really want to eat there, starts serving food at 5 PM. We could really use a little bump. If you want any verification, let me know. I have a pile of used tissues right here if you want a picture of that. I would be willing to send gifts of drawings to anyone who sends a pizza.   [Here](http://i.imgur.com/zSK5C3O.jpg) is my Civil Liberties whiteboard that I have been working with.
735	False	a	Hey RAOP. Terrible, awful, no good day that may just get worse. No money in my wallet, the $100 paycheck I'm getting today is going to pay my $200 of bills, so obviously no food. Please, help. I will pay it forward ASAP.  Thanks.
736	True	a	Long story short, my mom and I are currently unemployed (ive been unemployed for 2 months now) and have no food in our house. We just spent the last of our money to pay our electricity bill (after they shut it off) and get dog food. We currently have no gas at our house so its been nothing but cold showers and microwaveable ramen cups for the last month, so a nice warm pizza would sure improve our day. I promise to not only pay the back the person who treats us, but would also repay the favor to another person needing a pizza in the future (after i can get employed) thanks  i forgot to add, we are in naperville (chicago area), IL  thank you sunbear0326 for the pizza! its a great change of pace! &lt;3
737	False	a	23 year old guy and I'm just really craving something hot to eat. If there's anyone out there willing enough to look out I'd definitely pay it forward at my earliest convenience. Thanks guys.
738	True	a	So it's the superbowl, I got no friends where I live, I am stuck at home with a broken down vehicle anyway. All I have left in the pantry till tomorrow night is crackers. A pizza would just make my day!
739	False	a	I'm broke this week and just had enough money to get bills paid and I am extremely tight on food. Most of what I have was a gift from my mother. A pizza would be extremely appreciated, and will be paid back in an offer-to-be. Thanks for helping a girl out! (:  Edit: Grammarz.
740	False	a	I'm not going to lie. We do have food. We have rice, beans and eggs. That's all we've had for about two weeks now. It is all we will have until the first of the month. Even then, majority of our money (about 1200 between the two to last all of September) will go to rent, bills, gas and the cheapest food we can find. So, while I'm not in complete desperate need of food, my roommate and I are just sick of rice and beans. I would kill to eat something that actually tastes awesome. Thanks.
741	False	a	Anyone that has gone through them knows that student finance in the UK is TERRIBLE. I have just moved in and I have 3.50 to my name unil mid next week. Im gonna do my best to get hold of my parents but they are at a music festival called alchemy until monday/tuesday so its gonna be hard.   Location area is nottingham, uk. 
742	False	a	Long story short, today is my boyfriend's birthday and it has nooooot gone as planned at all.   It sucks :( I want to take him out for dinner to try to fix this, but can't afford it. Broke as hell and I don't get paid until the end of the month.  I live in Canada, is anyone willing/able to help me out? Something delicious from Pizza 73 or Panago would go miles towards helping me perk him up and put a smile on his face.  Edit: scratch this request, guys. We're passing out now.  Keep calm and pizza on!  
743	False	a	I've had to make some sacrifices this last month to save my business and I'm at the end of the line. All the ramen is gone. It sounds like a client will make us whole tomorrow but I've been living on iced tea and bullion cubes for a couple days. Help me out with a pie y'all. It would mean a lot.
744	True	a	My mom is bed-ridden because of the prolonged symptoms of her brain surgery(she had a brain tumor). Stepdad has had surgery on both his knees and is the primary bread winner for the family. Brother works for a grocery store but he's putting his money into college. I'm going to college now and need a job asap.  A pizza would be great!  Edit: I live in Ventura, California USA
745	False	a	"Every day I wake up and think, ""It's a new day!!"" My positivity makes it to the office. I sit down, start working on optimizing our IT environment, check in with a colleague or supervisor, then remember, ""NO ONE GIVES A FUCK."" The day proceeds to beat that sentiment into me, as well as ""nothing you do matters because it will never see the light of day."" I waste more and more time on reddit, facebook, forums, whatever as the day goes by. Every time I manage to convince myself to work on something, I just get reminded by someone or some process that it's all fucking pointless busy work to distract me from the fact that this is not the job I interviewed for. By the time 5:00 rolls around, all I can do is shuffle home with that -_- look on my face and fall into yet another chair until it's time to sleep and repeat the same scenario the next day.  I would love something happy and unexpected to happen to me, but as we all know ""no one gives a fuck.""  Location: Texas"
746	False	a	A delivery driver was shot and killed while approaching someone stealing from coworkers cars: http://www.wthr.com/story/15957703/pizza-delivery-driver-shot-in-bloomington  I've never been on this subreddit before but I figured this was appropriate to link, and since that location is offering all proceeds to go to the family of the deceased( http://www.facebook.com/pages/Pizza-X/82904137667 ) I figured RAoP might be interested. There is nothing in it for me: I do not know the individual/family of the deceased, but I am from Bloomington and felt like outreach might be appreciated by his surviving family. 
747	False	a	Nothing special here, just haven't had enough money to even buy ramen noodles for the past 2 days and won't be able to eat until I get my paycheck on Friday. Any help whatsoever would be appreciated, even if it's just a link to a coupon for canned beans :P I am in the DC Area. 
748	True	a	Money is tight and I live in Boerne where there is like no pizza! Please be nice, and help a girl out. BTW, I love this subreddit!
749	False	a	I am not sure about sites like these but my neighbor told me about this website so I figured I would give it a try. I am a single pregnant mother of 1 child will be 2 when this one is born. A couple of weeks ago my husband decided he wanted to be with his ex so he left and went back to  her and left us alone. He has not paid one cent in child support since he left. I had quit working so I could go back to school in March so I do not have a job which makes it hard on me. I am looking for a job everyday but no luck yet. I would love to have one night where I do not have to worry about what to feed my son and myself. If someone can help me with pizza I would appreciate it very much. We only have a pizza hut here and I do not have a car so I can not go pick it up it will have to be delivered so I know you have to have a 12.00 order to get delivery. Thank you to anyone who can help me.
750	False	a	I recently just had surgery to have my upper and lower jaw broken. My jaw was wired shut for 6 weeks. The only thing i ate other than liquid was mashed potatoes...so now that I can eat solids, I'm giving Reddit first chance to feed me.   P.S. I have 0 dollars as i have not been working and my mom will not pay for me as she is not a supporter of Pizza (shame on her).
751	False	a	If anyone feels like helping a sister out with a bit of pizza action, I'd *really*, truly appreciate it. Gave the last $20 I had till Wednesday to my boyfriend for gas money before he left for work....prrrrreeeetty hungry now with nothing in the kitchen. Thanks for any consideration.
752	False	a	Nothing more to really say, I have been clearing trees and brush for 6 hours and could really go for a pizza.
753	False	a	The title says is all. If anyone can spare me a pizza it will make me less depressed about what I have to do to get my Star Wars fix.  In London, On.
754	True	a	Hello Random Acts Of Pizza.   I come to you with an odd request. It is not to receive a pie, but for help.    **By ordering your Papa John's Pizza from www.pizza.gg you can save 50% and support the growing industry of competitive gaming.**    What is competitive Gaming? Competitive Gaming, or eSports, is a growing industry that has received a huge boom in viewership over the last few years with the advent of new Internet streaming services. Professionals on teams get paid to play games like /r/starcraft /r/leagueoflegends /r/DotA2 at the highest caliber. They battle it out in [tournaments](http://www.dota2.com/international/announcement/) for millions of dollars year round.    Millions of people watch this content every week. However we do not have sponsorship money coming in from Coke, Honda, Mcdonalds, or other mainstream companies. Papa John's is a serious contender in an effort to get more lifestyle sponsors into our growing industry. This is their first major fore into our industry. They are dipping their toes in. We want to blow their expectations away.    If even a few of you make your papa john's orders by going through www.pizza.gg this week it will mean a lot to me and a bunch of other redditors. Thank you    tl;dr Save 50% help some dudes out who like to watch professional video games
755	False	a	I moved to the UK from Virginia (DC Suburb) about 2 years ago and I worked at a Franchised owned Subway Restaurant and I was hospitalized while I was there. When I got out of the hospital, I found out that I no longer worked there. that was about 2 months ago. I have been struggling to find a job in the last 2 months and I just paid my rent and now I am now down to my last ¬£7:  [Account Info](http://i.imgur.com/wJU3K.png)  Any help to eat something other then cheap tinned food would be greatly appreciated. Thank You.  Also, when I do get a job, I will give out 2 pizzas.
756	True	a	I'm not going to do the whole sob story, I'm just gonna say: 21, female, rather strapped for cash at the moment. I'm alone for Christmas because I'm stuck in town working and all my friends are going and visiting their families like most average people. My next decent paycheck isn't until January 10th (I do have a very small one coming in on Friday, but because one of my two jobs isn't active during the winter break, said check will be very small and immediately eaten by groceries). I'm not out of food yet and can probably make it until then. I'm just kind of lonely and really want a pizza.  I'm prepared to do that verification thingy mentioned in the sidebar. I am also prepared to make you a really bad drawing in MS Paint, because I'm bored and don't have that much to do.  Also, Merry slightly-early Christmas!
757	False	a	Near Charleston, SC. I just got a little behind this month. I'll give a pie out to someone on Monday, or I will give one back to the sender! EDIT: I'm still requesting if anyone is interested. It'll feed me till monday. Thank you. 
758	False	a	Hello, New to site; Really could use a Pizza for self and family; currently unemployed. TORRANCE, California, USA
759	True	a	I'm not going to bore you with a long-winded explanation. It's simple. I'm broke, hungry, a week from payday and have now been informed I'm working a graveyard shift.  I'm also a self-published author who is in the midst of finishing up his second fantasy novel, which will be published in print and ebook, and I'm willing to give someone a free copy of the book, AND include you as a character in the fifteenth chapter of the sequel. You will be forever immortalized as a character in fantasy fiction.  [The book](http://www.ejspurrell.com/engines-of-creation-series/children-of-the-halo/) 
760	False	a	"Hey All! I've been struggling financially the past month due to some major medical bills. I am a single mom to a 3 yr old son and right now don't have much more than canned vegetables &amp; box of pasta. It would mean so much if I could surprise my son with a pizza as he's been eating the same ""create a meal from whatever I have around the house"" for the past week. Tonight he asked for something different, I told him we couldn't do it, and I remembered seeing this subreddit awhile back and thought I'd give it a try. I will return the favor as soon as I'm back on my feet financially. Thank you so much!"
761	False	a	Not much to say, boyfriend and I are rather broke at the moment, and can't get a hold of any local friends to help us. A pizza will at least tide us over for the night until we can get to the food bank tomorrow.
762	False	a	We're a group of 4 college students, who don't have enough money collectively to buy ourselves a pizza, so we thought we may leave it to the RAOP gods (or goddesses) to decide whether or not we're meant to have this pizza. We live in Central California, and would very much appreciate a delicious pizza!  
763	True	a	I'm broke until Thursday and pretty hungry. Any pizza received will be paid forward, promise. I'm located in Dublin, Ireland.   Using a throwaway account because I'm ashamed.   http://www.just-eat.ie/

This is the last week we will have together before we go to either sides of the country for university. Would also be more than happy to post pictures afterwards! Thanks in advance.
766	False	a	I literally haven't eaten a meal since last Friday night.. and the friends and family I have asked, have done so within the last month. I don't have money or food at home and I won't until next Monday. I really hope someone will be kind enough to help me out! Please message me.
767	False	a	So my bank card mysteriously stopped working.  And  so I cant withdraw cash.  I sent a message to the bank but they wont get back to me for 24 hours.  Basically I havent eaten today.  I have to get off the hostel computer so I cant stick around so please post in the comments if you decide to help me out so other users know.  I¬¥m staying at Hostal Forestal, Coronel Santiago Bueras 122, Santiago de Chile and my name is Nick.  This subreddit is amazing by the way!
768	False	a	Today is my birthday and I would love - more than anything - to have some pizza with my friends. I go to the University of Texas at Arlington. I don't really plan on doing much today aside from chilling and hanging out with my friends. I know that there are other people who are more deserving than me, but it's worth a shot to ask, right? Not really asking for much. Anything you can offer would be amazing. If not, at least go give someone else something! Thanks everyone!
769	True	a	My birthday is on July 4th and I was wondering if anyone would be so kind as to get me something to eat. I'm turning 19 this year! Please NO DOMINOS! I recently quit my job there and i would rather not see anyone that works there for a while.  I live 5 minutes away from East Lansing, MI (Close to Michigan State University)
770	False	a	Title is a pretty good TL;DR. Boss needed a scapegoat, I was handy. Had planned to make pasta but pizza sounds so delicious. Now that I'm income-less, pizza ordering will be eliminated. I'll draw you a picture as a thank you :) 
771	False	a	Hey bros, just wanna buy a $10 pizza and a 24 oz. of something to drink. They serve dinner here at the college pretty early, and the late night pangs just come in hard. Think you could send me about $15 my way?
772	True	a	Down to $.16 in a bank account and I have zero food in the house until payday eary next week. Haven't eaten all day and just got off a 11-hour shift. I'd really appreciate some pizza. This is a wonderful subreddit and I will be paying it forward as soon as my paycheck drops. Thank you kindly!
773	False	a	Today has been awful, I have no money, I got a bill in which I can't pay, I have no food in my house and to top it all off rent is due. A pizza would be amazing right now. Im in Londonderry - Northern Ireland
774	False	a	Recovering addict, now in college trying to turn life around, just out of food and was told of the power of reddit.  Thanks in advance
775	False	a	We still want pizza same as yesterday..we weren't successful yesterday..managed to get a few laughs, but that was it...pizza only this time, no drama, thx   EDIT: Thank you for your votes, I appreciate them, food stamps come in on Sunday, just trying to supplement what food we have left, can only eat Mac &amp; Cheese and Ramen so many days before getting sick of it.
776	False	a	The power went out, and with no money to order a pizza, a 16 year old is going hungry. I am sure I will offer some pizza when I get some more money, but for now, not much I can eat, and hot pizza sounds amazing right now.
777	False	a	Got a couple of friends coming over and itd be really awesome if we could all share some pizza  Heres a video of my cat being pretty cool.   [Meow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21mDTy5tDc8)  -----  Video Fixed!   Im in the yuba sutter area in california. I think dominos is really my only option. 
778	True	a	Hey there.  I've been struggling the past few months but this week has been a little rougher than most.  A check I was expecting from a temp job I had worked was lost in the mail and it sounds like I won't receive the reissued one until later this week or early next week.  My bank account is looking real sad right now and I've used up the last bit of my spare change to cover transit fare.  I've been eating a lot of rice and ramen but some pizza would be really nice if anyone could help.  Thanks for reading :)
779	False	a	Im sitting at home talking to some people online and i have a friend over.  We all just craved some pizza. I told them we would try this site out because we have no money. We have a dominoes nearby and i dont want to give my parents address out on the internet so i would love a giftcard.
780	False	a	Just moved to Conshohocken apartments in Philly. I have had ramen for the last 4 days and I wont have money for stuff for a few weeks. It would be awesome if someone could pizza-me-up sometime. PM me and I can of course give you any info if you are interested in helping me out!  Peace
781	True	a	Thanks for getting this far. Not to pile on the bad news, because it really isn't that bad, but I just got a call from the landlord that the power's been out for a few hours in my complex, and to be careful of the food in the fridge when I get back from work. Sounds like it could be a long day. I understand that my posting history isn't too broad, but is  I'm a long time lurker and this account is two months old. Maybe someone can help me out. Thanks and have a good day!  EDIT: I totally meant October 25th, not May 15. That'd be silly.
782	False	a	Currently very little food in the house things went bad this month for my family, both parents don't get paid till Monday, and currently i'm in college living with them. Would be great if anyone would be willing to make mine and my family's weekend with some yummy pizza.
783	False	a	My ex left and my sister is coming tomorrow to help me pack up her stuff. Unfortunately, I don't have any money until next week and I don't have much in the way of food. If someone could help us out with pizza tomorrow, we would be eternally grateful and could pay you back next week if need be. :)
784	False	a	I just received my Bachelor of Science in Statistics this past week. I would love some free pizza to accompany my evening of video games! 
785	False	a	"Came across this subreddit while ""Random"" surfing. I would absolutely love to get a pizza and post an offer tomorrow after 3pm when I cash my check. (Pacific time, USA)  You can even pick how I distribute tomorrow pizzas!"
786	False	a	Okay so money is REALLY tight right now, and unfortunately our pantry is pretty much down to spices and some old milk.  A pizza would really make our day right now &gt;.&lt;.    Located in Moncton NB Canada!
787	True	a	My fiancee has been sick since last night after she got out of work with a fever, chills, and body aches. I have been working all day, and she has been at home in bed and I want to be able to bring home a hot pizza for us to have for dinner when I get out of work.  She takes care of me endlessly, and I want to be able to do something for her, we just don't have any money right now. I know she has been craving hot pockets all day, but we don't have any so I figure if it is possible, this will really help brighten her day.
788	False	a	I'm an employed woman that lives alone, I make enough to take care of myself, but no extras. I am going to visit a friend who is celebrating her youngest's 5th birthday...I bought her a cake, because she spent all of her money on buying him a Yu-Gi-Oh set of cards and toys but I'd really like to show up at the door with dinner for them. I wont be ordering it this very minute, not for a few hours even but there is only a Domino's in our town. Please help and I'll try to send pics! :)  My email address is rainbowsmoothie_elaine@aol.com, I wont be able to check reddit but I should be able to check my email from my cell phone! Hope this works!
789	False	a	Hey guys,  If someone could hook it up with a pizza while I do some homework that would be awesome.  I'm low on cash cuz I had to buy some school supplies.  I'll be able to get some next week and I will give a pizza out in return.  Thanks
790	False	a	My husband is the best husband, father, and friend I could possibly ask for.  In addition to his full time job, he also works a part time job so that we can make ends meet, but we hardly have anything left for anything extra.  For our anniversary today, we made each other gifts and I wanted to make him a nice dinner, but we recently had to drain our bank accounts to pay for an (unexpected) car repair. I would really like to do something extra nice for him.  Can someone please help me make this happen?
791	False	a	...but I'm a dirty bum with no money, so I can't get one for her.  [Here's a picture of me with my swollen face and antibiotics,](http://i.imgur.com/cfGHG.jpg) as proof that I'm actually unwell. I guess I can't prove that she's been helping me out, but... yeah, she's been a saint. She stayed up til 3am and missed her morning class to take me to the hospital.  I'm in Canada, so I don't know if that complicates things, but... hey, it's worth a shot. Thanks for your time.
792	False	a	"And I heard all about this great subreddit...I thought ""Hey!!! I like pizza too!!!""...Gimme a shout if you're willing to be generous. Thank You. Oh and btw I'm upstate NY."
793	False	a	There's a Domino's very close to where he lives, and I just wanted to brighten his day with a nice pizza! :D Thanks!
794	False	a	My financial aid still hasn't come through for me at school yet, so I've had to front my tuition bill. When it finally goes through, I will gladly return the favor to another human in need. 
795	False	a	Self explanatory. Sending all money home, have used this months allowance for work stuff. My next day off is Tuesday. Let's hang out at the Pizza Hut and share a pizza (that you bought)!
796	False	a	An Xmas party tradition is being rekindled by some of my friends tonight and it would be great if there were some pizza there to soak up whatever it is we'll be drinking. We're mainly students and/or poor loveable folk, we would really appreciate something pizza based tonight :).    Will of course pizza it forward in the new year when my student loan comes through
797	False	a	Thanks, Redditors
798	True	a	WARNING: TL;DR   Hey, so after 4 years of knowing this person, I've finally asked out the woman of my dreams to a date this Tuesday, and I'm STOKED! Problem is...I am broke. I'm only in 10th grade and my parents aren't big on lending me money. That's a big downer. However a good buddy of mine has been a Redditor for some years now, and he said that what I should do is come here for random acts of pizza. Normally, being the internet, I'm unsure how this works or if the internet is a kind-hearted place or not. So...going on my friends word.. Can you guys help me with this date? I don't wanna lose her after the first date. Thanks Reddit!  [TL;DR] I have a first date with a 4 year crush in a few days and my friend reccomended me to ask here for the most romantic pizza dinner by Reddit.
799	True	a	Thanks in advance to anybody willing to help us out.
800	False	a	My roommate and I are hopefully graduating next week on my birthday, currently doing an all-nighter but our grumbling tummys are interfering with our studying. Rent is due tomorrow so that means no funds :( However a pizza with pineapple tomato and canadian bacon from wise guys would most likely help us focus, and thus graduate. making our last four years worthwhile. 
801	False	a	I am only a freshman in college in Georgia. I don't have a job so I don't have any money to buy pizza. I am applying to three places. If I am pizza'd or not I will either just give or PIF. 
802	False	a	So the girl I came to California with bailed leaving me to pay the entirety or the bill for the place I rented. Cutting down my already tight budget. Anybody wanna help me out?
803	True	a	Hey ya, I am coming here to ask for a pizza if any one is feeling kind enough!  I'm pretty hungry and I have no buying power.  I am a very poor college student whos had it pretty rough in the past year and...  Well, I'd enjoy a pizza very much.    Thanks guys and gals, I really appreciate it and I try to pay it forward each day by just being a kind person each day in real life.  :)  
804	False	a	I just spent the last of my money on school clothes, anyone want to share a pie?
805	False	a	In the Clifton area, unemployed for a month and half now, down to my last scraps. Anything would be much appreciated. Send PM for details. Thank You.
806	False	a	My job cut my hours and I'm living off ramen and peanut butter. Riding my bike looking for a new job the last two day's has got me pretty tired. If some one can help me out, it would make me extremely happy. 
807	False	a	There's a bunch of people around here who actually need a pizza 'cause they don't have food or whatever. So if you're looking to give, get to them first.   I've been depressed for quite a while now, give or take 4 years, mainly due to the pressure from my family to go to college and get a degree. I've messed up quite a bit during that time, all of it my fault honestly, and so I've gotten academically suspended for a year. This has escalated my depression because I feel like I'm just throwing away opportunities like it's nothing and letting everyone I know down. Today's been especially bad, I had a pretty shitty dream were everyone finds out what I failure I am, the first thought I had today was about suicide. I know I wont do anything, but it's still an awful way to start my day. So I've been drinking the day away and being generally useless.   Sorry for the boring story but it just feels better to type it out. It's not like I'm lacking food, I could go make a sandwich, but a pizza would be nice since I don't have the money for that.     
808	False	a	family of four just short on cash til next week and can use some good food anyone want to help us out. dominoes would be fine for us thanks...
809	False	a	hey ROAP, i'm pretty much out of money for the next two weeks and it would be amazing if someone bought me a pizza. I could care less where it's from as long as it makes me not hungry. Doesn't even have to be pizza for that matter, just any food really.
810	False	a	I'm staying at college for most of winter break to work. I haven't gotten my paycheck yet because of a coworkers error in submitting timesheets. I currently have $0.03 in my bank account. I'd much rather enjoy pizza that will last a couple of days instead of ramen again. Thanks!
811	False	a	This is pretty embarrassing, but yes I broke my bed. I'm going to be sleeping on my mattress for a while and I have no idea as to when I can replace my bed. I also had to pay off an old medical bill, which left me with .22 cents in the bank. This is by far the most depressing day I've had in a very long time. I'm willing to show my bank balance and a copy of my receipt from the hospital. Please help turn my frown upside down.  I'm in Georgia.
812	True	a	Hi everyone. I usually just lurk around reddit and read but I'm here today because I really need help. I usually do ok with bills and food but this month I had some unexpected bills and we are out of food. I posted in food pantry and Assistance but someone told me maybe look here also. I was wondering if someone could help wit maybe a 15 dollar gift card so I can feed the kids tonight. I hate to come here and beg and I probably should have come earlier but I hate hate hate to ask for help. We have a dominos and they have those 5.99 pizzas if you order 3 and I have 4.oo so if someone could help I would be so thankful. I get paid on Monday and I would happily send it back. Thank you for reading.
813	True	a	**EDIT! The wonderful Hrnmyd has provided me with the pizza I asked for! THANK YOU SO MUCH!**  I just started college in Virginia and there was a mix-up at the unemployment office, so I have no money for books, bills, rent or food. My girlfriend and I are currently living on ramen noodles. It's been two weeks now and the Unemployment Office still hasn't set things right.  Come February, my GI Bill money should start rolling in and I'll be able to pay for rent, food, books and everything, no problem. Once the money comes in, I promise to pay it forward TWICE.  If anyone is willing to help us get over this hump, I would greatly appreciate it. And like I said, the favor will be repaid twice. Thank you.
814	False	a	My German teacher told me about this site yesterday and it took some time to actually find it. I am 17 and want to show my 'rents I appreciate them. My mom is great, but this is mostly for my step dad who is like a real father to me. I just found out that he has been making payments so i can go on a trip to germany with my class this Summer. We don't have that kind of money. i don't have a job 'cause my mom wants me to just worry about school and keeping my grades up. I would love to give them pizza for dinner. If anyone wants to help, i would be greatful. I read everything and if someone can just make sure i do the verification thing right, i would appreciate it. We have 4 ppl in my house, my 'rents and me and 11 year old sister. thanks.
815	False	a	That's pretty much it. I'll be playing The Walking Dead: 400 Days all evening  Henderson, NV
816	False	a	I'm 23 years old, graduated from college this past december, when doing so I lost my on campus job. After that, I interned on a feature film for a month, meaning I worked at least 12 hours a day, for no pay. Since then, I've done my best to find a new job, but I live in a smaller, rural area, meaning there's not a whole lot of jobs to go around. This is my first post on this subreddit, but basically, I love pizza, and I would just love to eat. Thanks for reading.  EDIT: Just found out that because my mom was forced into early retirement, she has to pay $10,000 a year in income taxes for the next few years. So the $30 I have, is what I have.
817	False	a	I'm 5 months pregnant with no food and i have a 3 and 5 year old. My husband worked through a temp agency and for the week of christmas his work slowed down so we are in a really tough bind with everything. we did get food stamps and i missed my review because i don't have a car. My kids are crying because they are hungry. so if someone could please help us out with a pizza it would really help thankyou and god bless.
818	False	a	Readers Digest version of today: My biological father (who hasn't been a part of my life) had all of his siblings message me and tell me that *I* was the reason he wasn't involved.  So, I spent a lot of the day crying.  On top of it, my baby has a double ear infection AND hand, foot, and mouth.  AND it's 102 degrees outside. Meaning the oven on would make it worse.  I know tomorrow is a new day, and will be better...but today, I would really like to enjoy a meal I didn't cook myself.  I know I could get dinner from pizza hut for like $15 including tip.  If anyone could help me out, I'd totally pay it forward when I have some extra cash.  If not, thanks for letting me get all that junk off my chest.
819	False	a	I'm curious to see about the magic that is RAOP in action. I didn't have a bad day, no sob story here, just kinda hungry and don't care to cook. x)  Anyone wanna throw me a pie?
820	True	a	Just spent nearly the last of my money repairing nerve and tendon damage at Cedars on my hand. Had a great friend drop me off at home, but have and empty fridge, and can't really travel anywhere due to drugs still affecting me.  Randomly remembered this subreddit in a post surgery haze, and thought I'd plead to the reddit Gods.   Will answer any, and all questions if there is any doubt.   Sorry if this is the wrong format for this subreddit as well. I'm doing my best here!   Thanks everyone. 
821	False	a	My parents and I are on a gluten free diet (no flour/wheat - no pizza crust) and scraping toppings off just ain't my thing. Domino's is the only place in the area with a Gluten-free option, and it's pretty expensive. We would buy it ourselves, but our household is in a bit of a financial pickle. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks so much in advance!
822	True	a	"First timer!  I saw the post from that guy saying he was leaving because of all the sad stories. I think the ""half-full or half-empty"" rule applies here. You can see sad stories, or joy from getting help from a stranger!  Also, I will try my luck! It is not in the intention of feeding kids. I'm just a random guy that just moved to Montr√©al, QC. My delicious ""flour-water-salt"" pancakes got the job done for a few days. But now I think i need some fat in my belly :\   It will be paid forward before the holidays!   I will now leave you with this:   * 3 billion pizzas are sold annually, that's 46 slices each for every man, woman and child in the country.  Do you eat 46 slices every year ?    EDIT: Typo"
823	True	a	I have some really good Domino's coupons and no money(well not enough to splurge on pizza anyway!) until next Thursday. If you have it in your heart to donate a gift card to me and my 3 kiddos, it would be a nice holiday weekend treat! Thanks for reading!
824	False	a	Hello i am in college and i have not had pizza since the roommates left for summer, i live two houses from a pie jiont and have been smelling the good stuff all day, do not have the funds and it would make my day to nom on some za'  Thanks
825	True	a	Hi guys! Thank you to all the people who have helped someone in need, you truly are amazing people. Long story short, I'm out of money and quite low on food for the next week or so, mainly due to the fact that I was forced to go to the ER last Friday because of a serious burn on my foot and, of course, I don't have any insurance. This wiped out my whole bank account, which then got overdrawn due to car insurance and a couple of checks that I had written a few days before. I'm starving tonight and I've basically only eaten fried eggs and toast this whole week. I understand if no one can help, but if anyone can help me out with some food for the night I would never forget it. As soon as I can get my bank account back in the positive I will definitely hop on here and help someone in need. I don't really know how this works (do you order it over the internet usually? Do I have to cover the tip?) so bear with me if it takes a couple of PM's. I'll be on Reddit all night, as usual, so I should respond quite quickly to any offers. Once again, thank all of you! Peace and love.  **EDIT:** I thought it might help to point out that I live very close to downtown, so there are a pretty healthy amount of pizza places that would deliver. Thanks!
826	False	a	I've never done anything like this before, but I am willing to try this out. I am the proud mother of an awesome toddler whose favorite food is pizza. Today is the first day of our staycation, but I am poor until Friday when I get paid. Hoping to make my little man smile by having some pizza for lunch
827	False	a	[Imgur album!](http://imgur.com/a/pZ1PB)  I make these in my free time and would love to share them with someone for a pie! I do not use graph paper anymore so there are no noticeable lines, and the best part is that I will literally send these anywhere! I'll even do other characters from other NES games. (No customized ones though, I'm not that good.) Thanks for your help!  *EDIT Forgot to mention that these are cutouts. Hang them in your room if you want!
828	False	a	"Here's the web you can order from: http://www.telepizza.es/  In the name you can put ""indignados"".  Barcelona address: plaza Catalunya s/n  Madrid address: plaza del Sol s/n"
829	True	a	So if you check my history you'll see in the last three weeks my credit card was skimmed, my car window busted, stitches put in my back without insurance, etc. etc.  Today I just got my electric bill. $320 dollars because my 17 year old thermostat decided it'd be cool to run the AC and heat at the same time. I work part time for a non-profit that doesn't pay much. With everything that's happened, I am tapped out and will be for a couple months. A pizza can probably last me three days of leftover goodness.   I've been making the most of noodles, rice, and such from the Food Bank for the past week. I'm hungry and I hate scammers. I intend to pay it forward. I have no problems using the verification code/PMing my address/sending you a printscreen of the adorable graph on my bill quadrupling/etc.  Thank you friends.
830	False	a	Emancipated from my family a few weeks ago, trying to find a job but it's difficult with little work experience. Nothing would be more appreciated than a little pizza to make it through the week.   -Jason
831	False	a	My parents are visiting my Uncle in Vermont have no service to provide me with money to order dinner for the night. My University ID was stolen from me and since I dont have money I cant get a new one, Pizza would help me get through this weekend until I can get a new one! Please Help 
832	False	a	Well were having a lan party but our pizza guy is out of town so can some one help some fellow gamers out?
833	True	a	I've been pretty much struggling with money this year, my already small loan was reduced, the money I had saved from summer didn't go far as a lot of it had to step in to cover the shortfall in my rent and the part time job market sucks.  So toward the end of this year I've been selling stuff to make ends meet. I sold an effects pedal last week for ¬£30 thinking I would budget ¬£10 a week for food to last me.  Now I get an interview for a job back in my home town and I had to spend the next 2 weeks food money on tickets to go to it. I've got rice, butter and frozen peas, but I'd sure like something more substantial if a redditor was kind enough to help a brother out?
834	False	a	Girlfriend's out of town for the weekend, but even if she were here her car's busted, and we're both broke. So i'm just sitting here on Reddit, depressed and hungry. Pizza places don't open for a little bit here but if someone could help me out with a pie and a 2 liter you'd be my hero.  Edit: I'm an idiot and totally spaced on the location. Oh well. If anyone sees this and wants to take pity, i'm in Tempe AZ. I'd edit the title but dunno how.
835	True	a	FIRST OF ALL I DON'T NEED THIS PIZZA.  There seems to be a lot of people that do so go to them first.  But I do love the whole idea of the subreddit and thought it'd be fun to try. I religiously love pizza. :)
836	True	a	Hello fellow pizza enthusiasts, it's been a rough couple months. I've been subsisting on instant pancakes and rice for quite a while now since the opening for the store I'm supposed to work at keeps getting pushed back. Suffice to say I have never wanted a pizza more in my life. I've got 6 bucks left to my name and really just want a dang pizza
837	False	a	"So I'm chilling at home right now playing some League of Legends, and for this week apparently my timesheet hadn't switched from ""Temporary EMployee"" for working over the summer over to the regular ""Student"" pay, semester has started. No pay for this week and am craving some pizza! Anyone wanna help a brother out? Willing to gift a champion or skin in return :)"
838	False	a	I'm a college student in Seattle, WA that is looking for a job, but I'm running super low on funds right now. Papa John's has a buy one get one free today, and that could feed me until friday! I'm totally new on here, but would be so stoked if somebody could help out. If this does work, I will pay it forward, because I don't want the guilt of receiving two free pizzas without helping out somebody else when I can to give me indigestion. I don't think there's a Random Acts of Tums on here anyways.
839	False	a	"I have friends who come over every Sunday for our weekly table top. We always order food or cook a meal for the group. None of us are needy, but I see a potential to get them involved with RAOP.   If pizza shows up at our game with no knowledge of the players, it would be ""magical"" and would make them all aware of the RAOP. More importantly, they would now be inclined to participate.   So, yeah. No one is needy/broke etc, I just wanted to start of a chain of action from our Table Top Adventurers. :)  **Edit: I have no idea how to clarify that this is no longer needed since the time past. I saw that the moderators don't want these things deleted so...**"
840	False	a	I got fired from the shittiest place ever and i could really use cheesy goodness to cheer me up
841	False	a	Two college students studying for finals week, was going to make a box of Kraft Mac and Cheese but am all out of milk and already had eggs once today. Any help would be paid forward when work study checks come in. 
842	False	a	Unfortunate events has put me and bad situation until Friday, my electricity went out mid day afternoon, and i wont have the funds to pay it until friday. Cant cook or anything until then and really dont have the ends to feed my kids. Looking for a little help to then, anything would be appreciated 
843	False	a	If calling me an idiot and judgmental wasn't enough, this douchebag runs over my cat and doesn't tell me about it. He brought the poor thing to the vet but now he's sticking me with the bill. I NEED SOME PIZZA TO MOURN MY BABY'S MURDER. :CCCCC Plus, I'm hungry. &lt;3   RIP; Sparky &lt;3333
844	False	a	Just spent a small fortune at the doctors office and the drug store.  Could really use a pizza pie for supper and to brighten the day.  We don't get more cash until next Wed.  But will gladly return the favor then for a pie tonight.
845	False	a	My 17yo son has 4 friends over (since last night), and the wife, trying to keep the costs of feeding this many noisy LAN gamers/Magic players under control, builds a monster meat loaf in our 11x17 Pyrex pan for our Sunday meal.  Cold meat, cold pan, cold oven - safe right?  She assembles the load, puts it into the oven at 325.  10 minutes later, we hear a muffled wet crack in the kitchen - and she finds that we now have a hot mega-mess in our oven.  No way to filter glass out - shattering pyrex could launch chips into the meat - and no way to use the oven until all the chips and fragments and gibs are collected off the bottom - ugh...  I'm starting to think these Pyrex pans shouldn't be trusted once they pass 8 years old!  http://www.flickr.com/photos/87675548@N02/9440810218/in/set-72157634936382098  Thanks in advance, Redditors!
846	True	a	I finished the last of what I have. I'm a student without anything to eat today and a pizza would really help right now =\
847	False	a	We're pretty freaking hungry. We get paid Friday but until then we have nothing. I knit like a madwoman and I will gladly send a knit good of your choice in return for a delicious pizza.
848	True	a	I like pizza, you like pizza. PIZZA? 
849	False	a	I'd love to get a pizza for my dad, it'd have been my moms birthday tomorrow and hes taking it pretty rough.. he's visiting me tonight and I can't afford to get one myself right now, buy will pay it forwards asap, promise ! (toronto, ontario, canada)
850	False	a	I have this week alone to make up all the work I have missed. I have just lost one of my cats to liver disease and I miss him alot. He was only 2 years old. Midterms are next week and I have to study along with getting my work in. A redditor giving me a pizza will make my week and make me work even harder. I will also take requests for things to do in return. Thank you! (I live in Ypsilanti, Michigan)
851	False	a	a pizza would brighten my childrens thanksgiving 
852	True	a	"I've been out of work for a couple months now, dealing with my bi-polar disorder/depression. Reoccurring hospital visits caused me to give up my job and move back home and ""start from scratch."" I could use a lift. The money that I DID have saved has gone to help out around the house and i've not really been left with much else. I'm really not one to ask for handouts, but as far as food goes lately it's been slim pickens and a pizza sounds good :) Thanks for reading and if you can help, thanks, and if not, thats okay too."
853	False	a	Hey fellow RAoP'ers Just paid rent and am low on cash. I would highly appreciate a pizza and it would definitely help this weekend! Thank you for your time and consideration.
854	True	a	:-) pizza sounds amazing
855	False	a	It's summer, I'm a student, and I'm broke for the next week or so. It would be really, really nice to have a hot meal delivered to my doorstep. I'd repay the community once my student loan comes in, but until then I'm getting kind of sick of ramen.  Thanks for reading. :)
856	True	a	Today is my birthday, and I'm hungry. I'm a non-trad college student and a single mom. My daughter is at her dad's at the moment.  I'm flat broke. I spent the very last of my money on food, but ramen and fish sticks aren't sounding very appetizing at the moment. I have a code for 20% off at Papa Johns, btw. [Birthday proof](http://imgur.com/RZr9T.jpg)
857	False	a	Just started working yesterday and I'm tireeeeeeeeed. It'd be cool to kick back with my friend and eat some pizza. I don't have a sob story, sorry.  Thanks! :)
858	False	a	One Pizza Please. Thank you Reddit.
859	False	a	Just throwing this out there. Will pay it forward when possible. 
860	True	a	I volunteer at a firehouse and we love pizza!!
861	False	a	Going through a slow separation with my wife (been together for 8 years) and today dad decided to berate me about God and told me I was wasting my time at college and then finished by telling me I was a disappointment. Pizza would help a lot right now.
862	False	a	My good friend lives in Norcal and she and her husband have been out of work for a long time. They have a little girl, and won't take any more help from me because they feel indebted and quite frankly I'm not in a financial position to be able to at the moment. I think if a magical pizza appeared at their door, it would make their night/week! 
863	True	a	The title pretty much says it all;  I'm working on my last semester in uni, been surviving off rice, coffee, and free food samples on campus for the last month.  Wouldn't mind a delicious pie to satiate my taste buds.   Thanks for reading :)
864	False	a	Poor guy hasn't been able to shower taking care of our son who just started crawling like a maniac! I'm in Oregon and he's in Washington. He transferred the last of his money to me since I had to pay for my trip out of pocket with a reimbursement program.   He's pizza-obsessed! I would love to order it for him, but his transfer won't go through til Monday so were both lacking, he deserves it more though.   I will try and attach a photo of my crazy kid as well for good measure!!!   http://i.imgur.com/AczHQkD.jpg   http://i.imgur.com/Rol5zzM.jpg
865	True	a	I missed two weeks of work earlier this month due to an episode of depresion, and now the bills are looming so money's tight. Been living off cups of ramen and bowls of pasta to cut down on food costs, but a pizza craving is hitting me hard today. I'd appreciate it, and pay it back (or forward!) when I get some money to myself.
866	True	a	After putting gas in my car, I'm now broke. I ate my last two eggs this morning. Normally my orange tree in the backyard would get me through but I gave my last few oranges to my neighbor.  [Pic of ID](http://i.imgur.com/vlP2G.jpg)  EDIT: Thank you DickBaggins!  [Here's a pic](http://i.imgur.com/bxk6F.jpg).
867	False	a	I'm a student who's exhausted my semester fund, and my boyfriend's paycheck is lost somewhere in the mail. I'm hoping that someone could help us out tonight, as we've exhausted the pasta reserves in the pantry. Thanks guys.
868	False	a	Folks I need your help. My co worker has a cousin that is having a setback with Financial Aid. Her cousin has not eaten in 3 days. I know for fact my co-worker would not lie to us, we are a very close-knit department part of a major company. I have already [sent](http://i.imgur.com/i11XkFu.png) a Pizza Hut Gift Card for $25 and a few of us have already donated. Anything you would like to share as well would be appreciated.   She does not know I am posting this here, nor does she know what reddit is. 
869	True	a	I am not starving, I do not NEED this, and I can well afford some pizza because I live at home. But I want to participate and would absolutely pay it forward for the fun of it. I think the only place near here is Dominoes, and my GF will be coming over in a few hours and we are going to just watch a movie, hopefully with pizza lol.
870	True	a	Sorry, this is a throwaway, can provide my real UN if someone wants to help out.   It would be really awesome if someone could order my husband and I a pizza. We have no children or anything like that. Just broke until tomorrow. We usually plan our money well, but our car broke down 2 times in the past 3 days. First our fuel pump went out, we got that fixed now the battery went out (possibly the alternator which I hope not) . We just bought this car so it cut us short all around.. We don't have enough money to even get the /battery/ fixed until tomorrow as well. Anyways that's the reason why we are broke at the moment. We usually keep our refrigerator full but that didn't happen this week.   Also..some kind redditor helped us out awhile ago with pizza. I have 10$ in my amazon account I can order something for you in return.. We're just really hungry..  Sorry if this is kinda all over the place I have not slept in almost two days.   If you need any proof just ask, nothing to hide here.   
871	False	a	Fever of 102 degrees and can barely leave my couch. :/ would love a pepporoni pizza.   P.S. I hate thin crust...  EDIT: Sorry noticed typo in title....
872	False	a	Hello nice folks!  I just got back from a two week tour starting from Minnesota.  We hit up like 11 states down south within that time period.  Needless to say, Im flat broke and pretty hungry!  Also, there was a complete lack of pizza during the tour, which is absolutely insane.  Thats what being in a band with vegans gets ya!  Now I crave it, and I have no moneys to spend.  
873	False	a	I moved away from home a little over a year ago to be with my husband. I have four younger sisters and my family is very close, so this was tough for all involved, but we keep in touch, and not a day goes by when I don't talk to at least one of my siblings via Steam or Facebook. I just missed an IM from my little sister lamenting that another week is going by, and my family hasn't got the money for food right now. She was upset because their pets are hungry, and that all she'd had for lunch was a piece of bread. I feel awful about this, but I'm not really in a position to do anything about it myself. Making matters worse, I thoughtlessly made a comment on Facebook earlier today, complaining about all the leftovers in my fridge, and wishing that my sisters were around to help. How I must have made them feel upon reading that puts me near tears.  Their financial situation is complicated and I don't want to get into detail, because it's not my place to talk about their problems in a public forum. Suffice it to say, they're going through a rough patch, but if someone would be so kind as to provide them a hot meal, I hope that a random act of kindness would help them feel better about life in general. I've been where they are, and I know how low it makes a person feel not being able to afford food.   Here's my favourite picture of me and my siblings and our dogs, taken about a decade ago: http://i.imgur.com/jDz5L.jpg  Thanks in advance to anyone who's taken the time to read this.
874	True	a	The bike was chillin' on my back patio behind TWO gates, where I thought it would be fine. I just moved into this place last month to be closer to work... and a week later I got laid off.  My faith in humanity needs restoration, pronto! One little random act of pizza may not seem like much, but it could make all of the difference. 
875	False	a	Hey my payday has been delayed due to the holiday so I was hoping to get some pizza to help me hold over until it comes in. Thanks. 
876	True	a	I'm broke until the 28th and I wanted to make her birthday special this year because last year was the day she found out my dad had a new girlfriend. :\ Anyway, basically, my mom deserves a good day to relax and since we can't throw her a little party, we're hoping to get some pizza from either of her favorite places. Boston Pizza or East Side Mario's.  Edit: Pizza for my mom, brother, and I. (Edit 2: cleaned up the post.)
877	False	a	I've been broke and jobless, and waiting to hear back from a few places. Ive been trying my best to eat what I have around the house. Eating cereal everyday has been getting very tiresome and I was going to invite some friends over and would love to be able to offer them something besides a box of corn flakes. Thank you to anyone out there who is willing to give a pizza to a person in need. 
878	False	a	Get paid tomorrow and no pizza in the house. You can see my problem here :(
879	False	a	I'm sooooo hungry  im black
880	False	a	Hi! I'm new to RAOP but this subreddit looks wonderful. I'm not exactly sure how this all works, but my name is Johnny and I am hungry. Normally I would get myself some food, but I have no money tonight.  I wouldn't normally ask for someone to buy me pizza but the alternative to RAOP would be to not eat tonight, so might as well give it a shot. I live in Venice, CA.  If anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated, and regardless when I have money I'll be back to here to help someone else out.
881	False	a	Laid off earlier in the month... my bank account is in the red (-$0.39!). We're hungry and tired of canned vegetables and Chicken Helper. Can't even remember the last time we had pizza! We live a ways out from town... We don't have enough gas to pick any pizza up, and the only place where I live that delivers where I am is Papa John's. Thanks for your consideration!
882	True	a	Wow this is so amazing! Maybe reddit can help me out? I've been unemployed for three weeks. I applied for unemployment when I was dismissed from my last job at a restaurant. I had been working there for six months since it opened and it changed everything for me. I was on the verge of getting evicted when they hired me and I was able to turn that whole situation around because they took a chance on me. Now I'm more confident that even though I had been fired I immediately went out there to find more work. And even though I haven't been able to find more than a few temporary assignments I'm not discouraged about it.  However I am not living so comfortably. I had been living very much month to month. And I was able to pay June rent I don't have much left for food. Since I had been working at a restaurant I just ate for free there. Now I applied for food stamps in California but am not able to get an interview for benefits until after the 4th of July weekend. I showed up to the office and waited all day only to tell me that I can't do anything until that interview.  I've been paying for my food with change I find around the house. My unemployment check won't come until they do a phone interview on Friday with me. I won't have any money after I pay July's rent. And I definitely won't be able to pay utilities without the unemployment check. I don't want to seem like begging but I would pay it forward if you could help a fella out reddit.
883	False	a	I'm a broke college student that would love a pizza.  I have only $2 right now and have no food out my apartment. I will not be able to buy food until next week. I hate to ask for help but a pizza could go a long way and give me a few meals.  I promise to return the favor as soon as I have the money to.  
884	False	a	Please anyone willing to send me pizza ill make sure to repay when i get the money 
885	False	a	Been a rough few days with work and my personal life. Cell phone bill overdrew my account last night, had to borrow some money to get it back positive and be able to buy my bus tokens to get to work. Will pay it forward as soon as I'm able to.  Located in Northeast Philadelphia, can offer whatever verification needed.
886	False	a	I'm having a band meeting in south Philadelphia for my one manned band and between my manager and I... we forgot food. In return for a cheesy delight I will repay you with a video of me playing an original song with your name in it... and maybe mail you a cat.
887	True	a	"**EDIT**: [flamingcow](http://www.reddit.com/user/flamingcow) has graciously offered a gift card, so please consider this **Request filled** and see the other requests in the queue. Thanks flamingcow!  First off - I will **not** *starve* between now and Friday, so if you'd rather help someone who has absolutely nothing, I understand, appreciate your stance, and thank you for helping someone truly in need.    I've been unemployed for better than two years. During that time, I watched most of my photography clients (I did a lot of corporate work) shut down their budgets for expenditures like me. As that income dwindled, I began looking for other work. I'm not sure how much the year-long gap of ""employment"" (other than self-employed) has mattered, but I haven't been able to find anything. About a week and a half ago I finally got to the point I had to take a laborer job that's physically killing me (ok, it's only very painful). So I'll have something coming my way soon.    In the mean time, I have a 1/2 sack of potatoes, a few cans of corn, 1/2 jar of peanut butter, 3/4 loaf of bread, and a few boxes of mac and cheese. All of which is pretty much what I've been eating for the past couple of weeks. Like I said, I won't starve, but I damn sure don't have a meal I'm actually looking forward to for the next week.    It's just me. My dog passed the day after Easter, and as much as I'd love another pet, I know I'm not in a position financially to take on another right now. So even a medium pizza would be like 4 meals - I could take a couple of slices to work every other day for lunch or something just to break the monotony of what I've been having.    I'm not hiding behind a new account - I am who I am. A quick look at my profile will tell you exactly who I am, and hopefully give you a sense that I try to contribute to the community as well when I can (/r/TOMT, /r/picrequest, gift exchanges, postcards to kids/random people/etc., general blathering). You'll also see where I've sold some of my camera gear to a fellow redditor because I needed the money. I feel bad asking when it's not a matter of ""need it or I'll die"", but I figure if I'm just honest about where I am, someone might throw me a ~~bone~~ pizza in the spirit of the *Random Acts* part of the subreddit.    Either way, if you're still reading, you're a good person for even considering helping someone out. Thanks for being part of what makes reddit awesome."
888	False	a	People owe me but are refusing to pay. I want to eat something real just one night. Sorry for the desperation.
889	False	a	Don't feel like eating another box of kraft mac n' cheese made with gross half and half. May not be in as bad need as some people, but I've had a crap week. 
890	True	a	Hey if someone feels like getting me and my girl a pizza that would be amazing. Going through a bit of a rough patch. Anchorage Ak since I forgot to put it in my title. Sorry I didn't get much sleep yesterday. 
891	False	a	As the title suggests, I've got nothing in my home until tomorrow. My parents are out (small holiday like thing) and unfortunately my brother devoured all of the food in my house. This is a quick throwaway to avoid my friends whom all seem to stalk my history on Reddit. I'll be more than willing to provide my actual Reddit account in PM.   Appreciate you taking the time to read this
892	True	a	Hello fellow redditors,  I lost my job earlier this month, and my pockets are near empty. I'm fortunate to have landed a decent job, but my stomach is grumbling and I'm almost out of bread. It isn't a completely desperate situation, but if anyone is willing to help me out I couldn't thank them enough. I could send you a small painting or sculpture when I'm able to cover shipping and all that, if that interests you.  Thanks for reading
893	False	a	She can't stop eating! She keeps nibbling on chocolate and snacks, her favourite is.. you guessed it, pizza! 
894	False	a	Most of my money has been frozen online since April 15th and the rest of it is just about cleaned out from the past 2 months. I'm running out of things to eat for dinner and was wondering if any kind humans would like to help out for a night.
895	False	a	I was doing the keto diet for about a month and a half and lost about 20 lbs. I fell of the wagon about two weeks ago and while I haven't put any weight back on, I've stalled the weight loss.   I'm starting again tomorrow and I'm craving pizza like crazy but it's not in the budget.  If anyone is curious about the keto diet check out /r/keto its awesome!  Oh and I'm in MN USA  Thanks!
896	False	a	Hey guys, I'm really hungry. I could tell a sob story but I won't bore you. I get paid Friday and I will promise to pay it back to someone in this subreddit if you could be so Awesome as to grant me a pizza. End of story.
897	False	a	I'm hungry, spent what money I had and don't want to continue living off of ramen noodles, a pizza would be a blessing.   Of course for my IRL karma I'll be pizza'ing it forward soon!
898	False	a	Those men and women putting forth their time and effort running against Representative Todd Akin would greatly appreciate some pizza. They deserve it for their efforts, and I'll gladly fulfill a request on this subreddit once I get a steady paycheck.  Thanks in advance if anyone fulfills this. The Democratic Office in Hannibal, Missouri. 
899	False	a	Hi reddit, I am broke and just started work last week. I don't recieve my first paycheck till friday. Any chance I can find some random pizza kindness?
900	False	a	My car broke down and so I lost my job. The car was required for the job. My ex-employer is fighting my unemployment claim. It seems like they want to punish me for leaving them at a busy time so no help there.  I  My dog and I will have to move into my friend's shed at the end of the month. my dog is like my child and my last dollar went to feeding him. I'm very depressed. I spend 70-80 hours a week looking for work to no avail since I have no car any more. It would be angelic if someone could lift my spirits with a pizza.  I have verification if I'm fortunate enough to get a little help. Thank you and I hope everyone has a great day.- Jason
901	False	a	Title says it all. Today has been absolutely horrible. I was taking my youngest to a doctors appointment and my starter went out, my car is now sitting in the doctor's office parking lot until I am able to get to Cash Advance to take a loan out to get the parts my brother will fix it but being this late I have no way to get to the store with my FSC, I'm really exhausted. My cabinets and refrigerator is completely empty, I can send pictures as proof as well as any other proof. I really just want my children to eat. 
902	True	a	"Hey r/Random_acts_of_pizza, I don't normally ask for this sort of thing, but money is super tight right now, and we're down to our last pound of hamburger. Me and my girlfriend won't have a chance to get food again until the 5th, and after hamburger based food for the past week or so, we're sick of it.  So what I'm putting up on the table is, my girlfriend is an excellent artist. She mostly does anime, and stuff, but she's amazing at what she does.   For proof, [Picture 1](http://i.imgur.com/QvLL5.jpg), [Picture 2, WIP](http://i.imgur.com/mPF5B.jpg)  If you'd like to buy us a medium pie, She will gladly do a piece of art for you, anything you want.(Minus ""Mecha"") :D  Thanks for browsing, and I hope you have a wonderful day!  **EDIT: Oopsies! We're in Murfreesboro, TN. :D**"
903	True	a	this is my first time on this site, but i thought i should give it a try because i am really struggling. my husband of 4 years walked out on me and the kids almost a month ago. he got a new job and just up and left. we had a joint bank account and that all that has been feeding me and the kids, but now he transferred most of the money out of it and we have nothing. i was a stay at home mom, but now i am looking for a job so that me and my kids can get toiletries and basic supplies. my parents are still in the picture, but they dont understand why i dont try to reconnect with my husband, who i havent even spoke to and cannot find. they sent my children diapers, but im low on those now. all i am looking for is pizza for tonight it would make my kids day and cheer them up. there dad was a good man at one time and my kids still love him. they miss him and dont understand why he left. i couldnt bear to tell them the truth so i said he went on a trip. please somebody help us out with dinner for tonight. 
904	False	a	I've been sick 3 out of 4 weeks this month and I'm hoping its not something serious. I've been out of work quite a bit this month (although I'm going back tomorrow) and haven't been able to get medicine because I have no health insurance! Anyway RAOP, can you help me out? I will pay it forward next paycheck (on the 25th, since my paycheck on the 11th will barely be there). Thanks in advance! Whether I get pizza or not this subreddit is a great thing! :) 
905	False	a	Hello, people.   I was just told about this subreddit by a friend after venting to him about this evenings biggest annoyance. I've taken part in pizza sharing things before, I just honestly never knew there was a subreddit for it. My favourite time anything like that happened was this one time me and a friend spent _forever_ calling anywhere we could find in this small Czech town, trying to order pizza for a mutual friend we knew online, but that's a long and HILARIOUS tale involving calling the _Mayor_ even, and I'll gladly share it if folk want to hear it.  Anyway, my issue, sob story, whatever you wanna call it.  Basically I live with a flatmate in a really crappy part of the northwest UK, and this guy I share my space with is a presumptuous ass. It's not uncommon to find he's 'borrowed' something of mine, not cleaned after himself if he used the kitchen/bathroom/toilet/anything, and a favourite trick of his seems to be eating my food when he thinks I'm not in or asleep.  That happened tonight. I come in from a day out with family and open the fridge, I'd been planning on making a veritable bathtub full of chilli to eat and freeze in for the next few days until my payday, however tonight I get to learn that he's had company over and guess what he made for these upstanding citizens! He basically used _everything_ I had left, _everything_, to feed his drugdealer friends as they came over to smoke weed, be loud, and play/watch whatever happens to be ridiculously loud in the next room over. One pointless shouting match later I'm sat here tired, wet, and hungry enough that I'd happily eat my bed. Spoke with the family I _just_ came from about this and I'm invited back over for dinner on Friday, the day prior to my payday. Still leaves me foodless tonight and tomorrow, though, and a friend pointed me here. I already said that. Um.  I've no idea of etiquette here, I've no idea if I said too little or not enough, but hey there's my request. I will say though that I'm probably gonna stick around here, and will definitely pass on the favour to somebody elses request once I'm paid. Share the love and such.
906	False	a	Found out I still owed the government money now I only have $2.  Just want a pizza to last me for a few days.
907	False	a	I'm in the Pacific Northwest. Yesterday we had a beautiful, cloudless day, and while there's clouds out today - it's bright and shiny and pretty outside.  Could use a pizza to go with the gorgeousity while I'm stuck inside plugging away at a Java Programming I course. And yes I know, that's not a word. Unfortunately I live out in The Sticks (tm) and nobody delivers to me, but I'm willing to drive out and pick up a pizza.  (Dominos has that 7.99 lg pizza carryout deal, which helps)
908	False	a	I just got diagnosed with throbbing gristle disease. If you don't know what that is then you're defenatly better off.  Could really use a pizza tonight to take the depression away.  Philadelphia
909	False	a	My lover and I are far, far away from each other. We are both struggling with income and I want to do something nice for him tonight.   Is there anyone who would help me to send him a pie? I'm sure he's hungry.
910	False	a	Or I will just be forced to eat food at my work, and we only sell popcorn and pretzels. I hardly ever eat anything other than food from my work because I barely ever have extra money and I feel guilty buying food when I can eat that stuff for free. I make ten cents over minimum wage at my job and had to work 72 hours in the past two weeks so I could pay my rent. I just got paid yesterday and all but $27 of my paycheck has to go towards rent tomorrow. I will only have that $27 for the next two weeks. I feel bad asking for charity but I hope someone out there will take pity on me and buy me something delicious. Thank you!
911	False	a	Hi reddit, I'm new (but am enjoying this place so far!) so I hope this is still allowed. I'm an ex-Amish youth from a strict religious sect in Ohio who decided to leave during rumspringa. I have never had the chance to eat pizza or most other foods that are not home made until recently, but now I am in college and can do what I please.   I am pretty money-less at the moment and would love to be able to eat a pizza, and share it with my roommate. I am in Michigan, in the USA. I can post pictures of my first pizza eating experience if someone decides to help. Or if anyone has any questions, feel free to ask me. Thank you reddit!   Edit: Still no pizza :(! Welcoming questions, though!
912	False	a	I've been dating my boyfriend for three years now. We've been through a LOT, mostly due to my health. I asked for him to take time off of work last year to accompany me to my many appointments and he gladly did so. I am cancer free these days, have been in remission for six months and working two jobs of my own to pick up the slack on medical bills in collections... but he's doing nothing. I feel like a total asshole for expecting him to when I specifically asked him to take time off from his job, but I can't afford to keep both of us afloat anymore. He went home to see his family, but I'm unable to fly, so I'll be spending Christmas alone. I don't want him to see this, so I'm on a throwaway. :\ It'd be great to wallow in my holiday weekend and munch on some pizza for Christmas... I will pay this forward.
913	False	a	Hi,  I'm down to $2.45 in bank account exactly and eating oatmeal and hungry jack pancake mix to get through November. Would REALLY really appreciate a pizza as it is my favorite food. I'm a hard working young woman just have a rough month ahead of me.   Thank You. 
914	False	a	Hi everyone,  Me and my group members have a big project due in tomorrow at 4 p.m. which of course means we're going to be up all through the night finishing it, and would love some pizza to help keep us going. [we're in the UK if this makes a difference - never been on here before!]  thanks for reading,  3 hungry workers.
915	True	a	ive asked yesterday and got nothing and i just need something for today for dinner im willing to pizza it forward 
916	False	a	"I just found this community and am quite a fan of ""paying it forward"" surprise kind of things. So I figured I'd give it a try seeing I'm in a rather downtrodden mood as of late considering there has been nothing but bad luck for this girl lately. I wont get into a huge story about it of course. But crappy times usually promote me to seek comfort in some way.  Thanks for reading. And keep me in mind for a giver to anyone near my area.  Good Karma to you all. ^-^"
917	False	a	College diets are a bitch, especially if you're in that awkward summer waiting time.  I'm trying to hold out until the fall quarter starts up, but it's not easy.  The twist is, I'm not actually a redditor, I don't know the community or anything.  My boyfriend is a redditor and linked the RAOP page and suggested I try it, but I myself am not a member of the community, so I completely understand if it's like a real redditors only type of thing.  But, figured I might as well try it anyway, nothing to lose right?
918	False	a	As the title says I am not doing so well with money this week and I don't have much food, I just want some pizza, I will repay you in a few days, I promise!
919	True	a	Hello RAOP,  figured I'd give posting here a shot. I've been out of work for about six months now, applied literally everywhere in walking and bus distance. I still live at home, and on top of stretched funds, my mother's card recently got overcharged and left us with $15 for two weeks. She gets paid in a few days but I think instead of coming home and going straight to bed, a pizza might really lift both of our spirits. 
920	False	a	not working this week due to studies. I just want some tasty pie  
921	False	a	This morning for breakfast, I consumed essentially what was left of my actual food. I had some cheese, bacon, a hamburger bun, and a salad. Currently, I'm training for my new job and am finding it hard to focus without bringing lunch for my very full day. If I had a nice, hot, gooey pizza for dinner and lunch tomorrow, I'd be set. Pizza Hut has nice deals going on. Buy me a pizza and I will trade you a body/hygiene/cosmetic product from my future store (You can message me if you want to know what store that is, but it is a really awesome one). Thank you.
922	False	a	hello fellow redditors,  I am a contract programmer, and have been waiting over a week and a half for Canada Post to deliver at least one of my recent pay cheques.  So far I've managed to get by on a bit of groceries I had in my cupboard and from the food bank... but these supplies have unfortunately run dry.  Every day, I check the mail like an eager kid waiting for that parcel he ordered from the back of a comic book... but so far, nothing.  I tend to be really generous when I do have cash and have bought many meals for hungry folks... and will certainly be putting up an [Offer] post in here when my cheques finally do arrive.  If anyone out there sympathizes with the daily sinking heart feeling of waiting for that *special and important piece of mail*... please help a brother out?  Thanks guys!  **EDIT:** I live in Victoria, BC, Canada ... Postal Code: V8T 4A6 ... there is a [Pizza Zone](http://www.pizzazone.ca/) and a [Palagio Pizza](http://www.palagio.ca/) very close by to me!
923	False	a	"So, on my way to visit my parents I got a phone call. My mom clearly having difficulty speaking finally she let out, ""ginger died.""  Ginger was a 1.5 year old golden doodle. The little sister to our older dog dusty. She was a beautiful loyal curly haired monster who did not deserve to die.  I'm now sitting home alone because my fianc√© is at work in the navy, looking at gingers pictures, just sad.   I don't feel like cooking.  I would greatly appreciate a pizza.  Thank you."
924	False	a	Out of cash, out of food. No fun. Remembered my buddy mentioning this RAoP thing, figured I'd give it a shot.
925	False	a	Hi there. Im currently stuck on an Army base and our DEFAC (basically a cafeteria where they serve our meals) is closed. All DEFACs across post are closed. SO, If you would like to order me a pizza, you can rest assured you will have the favor returned on the 1st of August when i get paid. Also a little info on myself, Combat Medic, two years in service, live on Ft Stewart, GA, and Im out of money because I spent it all on my sons birthday when I was on leave last week. Alright thats it, lets hope this works. 
926	False	a	As the title says I was hit by a drunk driver. It was 2am last night and was 5 blocks away from my friends house. I was driving him home after his farewell party, he is leaving the city on Monday.   I was coming down a one way street with the right of way and no stop sign/light. He blew thru a stop sign and t-boned me. Before I even got out of my car to start dealing with everything he fled the scene leaving his friend behind in the passenger seat. This guy was visibly drunk and acted as if nothing happened. He fled 20 min after it happened.  I don't get paid until the end of the month but will pay forward as soon as I get my paycheck.  TL;DR drunk drivers suck
927	False	a	I'm a new father of a 10week old boy and I'm the only one working in the house. I recently got a new job after being laid off for 2 months so me and my wife and trying to get things back together. The only problem is, our money is drained right after I get paid because of past due bills from when I was laid off. Anything would help, I'd love to get my other half her favorite pizza on my first three day weekend.  By the way, I'm located in the states, Missouri to be exact. If you want proof I can send a picture of my son.
928	False	a	It's rainy season here and Seattle, and I haven't yet mustered to courage to go outside. Let me (and the dog) stay inside, in my leotard (and in her bear outfit), and eat dinner! I will photograph and submit several images of myself eating said pizza while in a handstand and/or various acrobatic acts. All, of course, in the name of proper digestion.  Thank you!  
929	False	a	"Well, it's Thursday and I am hungry. We get paid on the 15th of every month at my job, and when I looked when I paid all my bills for the first half of the month, I thought the 15th was a Sunday which means we would have got our paychecks tomorrow (Friday since they do not direct deposit on the weekend).  The first half of the month always kills me in bills so I know to be tight with money until I get paid next...well, I didn't expect to not have any money all weekend. Whoops. It is totally my fault though, since I totally looked at the wrong date. Derp.  Anyways, just looking for some dinner tonight that will last over into breakfast/lunch tomorrow, but I am not poor or needy by any stretch of the imagination, **SO THAT MEANS THAT IF THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE POSTING THAT SOUNDS AS IF THEY NEED THIS PIZZA WAY MORE THAN ME, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF CHEESE GIVE IT TO THEM OVER ME!**  I just want to get a pizza today and pay for it once I get paid, so that means if you buy me a pizza, come Monday you can (read: **YOU GOTTA DO IT MAN**) PM me saying *Hey, I bought you that pizza on Thursday, I want my pizza back now bitch.""* and you'll have a pizza sent right to your door!  Or, if you're feeling x2 times as generous, email me a link from RAoP that you chose and feel is needing a pizza, and I'll randomly send them a pizza. Pretty much, I feel shitty asking for a pizza tonight because it is just piss poor planning on my part with my pay, so I'd love to just give the pizza back to you next week or give it to someone else you deem is worthy."
930	False	a	I don't need a pizza, but in keeping with the name of the subreddit a random act of pizza would really hit the spot. Thanks!
931	False	a	[A post I made last week.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ij98l/offer_who_needs_a_pizza_and_why_payingitforward/c2475o2)  I still haven't got my new credit card and I'm running out of food. It's a prepaid card through my work so I can't access my funds from a local branch office.  Any help would be appreciated, and of course, the favor will be paid forward in the future.
932	False	a	We're two students that have packed up all of our belongings to go home, all of our money was used cleaning our dorm rooms (our electric meter has run dry  and there's nothing for us to eat until we leave tomorrow evening.  Please help us my stomach is making sounds like an erupting volcano :(.   We're currently based in Kent, which is in southeast England for reference, and will PM email address or whatever necessary if anyone would be so kind as to help us out. &lt;3  We'll be more than happy to return the favour when we're in more a advantageous situation.  Thanks guys.
933	False	a	It is me and my girlfriend's anniversary today, later tonight actually, and I kinda want to do something nice for her like a pizza dinner. Problem is, I am unemployed at the moment, so I can't really afford much besides rent. I've been tryin like crazy to get one or two of those avoid the noid cards, but no luck and today is the last day.  Could anyone help me out? Either with a pizza or a gift card? Or just well wishes. 
934	False	a	Poor college student who would love a pizza! A night off from homework, just relaxing and watching a movie with a pizza would be awesome :)
935	False	a	Me and my friend are house/pet sitting and the owners left no food. We don't get paid for a few more days and a nice hot pizza would mean the world to us. We will definitely do an offer once we get paid. Please pm me! Thank you!!
936	True	a	im a rugby player, and im due to start my last season for my college team in a month. sprained my ankle in july playing soccer, just got an MRI due to the persistant pain, and found out i shredded a ligament. its possibly surgical, and when i told my new boss, he said hed have to let me go because im on crutches and im 'a risky investment.' i had just paid my rent with the last of my savings yesterday before my doctors appointment, and i have $10 till tuesday [also my birthday]. just a little bummed and hungry--id really appreciate a meal, and id be happy to provide any sort of verification needed. thanks for reading.

939	False	a	Hellooo Redditors. I'm 22 years old and on my own for the first time, thousands and thousands miles away from anyone related to me, and my dog. I just got a new job, work 70 hours a week, make close to no money, and never have time to eat. Being so far from my family for the first time kinda blows, but I'm also proud to be doing it!  Pizza. Pizza is all I want. I just moved from a tiny town in Maine, where the closest real pizza was about 2 hours away. Besides craving pizza, I crave a filling meal, as I don't have the money or time to eat. (Rare day off)  EDIT: Totally forgot to put in that I live in Marietta, GA
940	False	a	IRL cakeday today. Some reddit pizza sounds like a great gift to this aspiring biochemist. PiF is a given, of course.
941	False	a	Been unemployed for the last few months, but I got a new job a week and a half ago! Only problem is, my supply has run dry and I'm not getting paid until the 12th.   I would be eternally grateful to anyone who can help me out

943	False	a	Would love some pizza and to pay it forward soon, my random kind pizza loving compatriots 
944	False	a	im hungry and tired and im locked out fro  my house for three more hours. I just got home and im locked out due to my brother being gine to school. 
945	True	a	"Hello, I'm TMHS, a ""professional writer."" This means I'm constantly broke. I have exactly $2.37 to my name until I hopefully get paid at the end of this week. My pathetic funds aren't even enough to buy my usual staple of poverty pasta from the corner store. I've been living on one meal a day for about a week, and have officially run out of food in my apartment. Its really either this or a condiment medley for dinner, so if you could find it in your heart to help me out, I would really appreciate it.   In return I will write you a personalized short story about any topic of your choosing. It can be funny, sad, sexy, anything you want... maybe a combination of all three? Hmmm?  Thanks in advance Reddit!"
946	False	a	Now I know just straight up asking for a pizza isn't really inventive or innovative, but I'm kinda just without any money at all and could go for one or two, saving the slices for a meal every so often. I think you can probably buy a pizza online from the Pizza Hut or Dominos NZ branch near me from anywhere in the world, but if you're in NZ that's even cooler. Anyway, yeah. Thanks in advance. I can give you my Steam name and we can have a few games to celebrate if you want, or I could give a little thanks on my Youtube channel if that's what you'd like. I can't really offer much other than that, but yeah, enough rambling. I guess PM me if you're willing? :D
947	True	a	I have no monies at the current moment until I sell my minivan for 2500. I hope it sells for 2500. Until such a time I am lacking food. A nice peperoni pie would be wonderful if anyone is so inclined.   I will return the favor and come here and buy someone a nice box of goodness once my van sells.   I have just fallen on bad times, I have poof of my lack of funds if that is needed.   I forgot to tell my location in the title, I am currently stuck in the Panhandle of Florida.    *Edit: Looks like I can not make a complete sentence. Oh well that is life.*   *Edit 2: Nazoth gave me some Pizza, well gave me a gift card. Live so far out, delivery isn't an option. That explains the odd sounds I hear at night. I swear it might be an Ood. I shall ride into town in my blue minivan to pick me up a nice pie. I'll be sure to share the love once said ride is sold, in order to keep folks with some pizza. Everyone likes Pizza* 
948	False	a	i'm really hungry and all my money is going towards my ultrasound tomorrow, pretty please with sugar on top buy me a pizza? i'll send you the ultrasound picture when i found out the gender tomorrow! celebration time! i'll also loveee you forever. thank youuu.

951	False	a	I turned 24 today and I don't really have any cash. I just moved to this state a couple of months ago and none of my family or friends live even remotely close. Anyone near 22193 and want to make my birthday suck less?
952	False	a	I don't have a sob story. I have things I could eat. I don't have much extra cash for pizza, and pizza sounds pretty good right now.   If nobody sends me pizza, I'll be just fine.   I'll trade you a cute picture of my cats. And I'll pay it forward when I get paid at the end of the month.  Have a good weekend!
953	False	a	So Here's the lowdown, I'm a 23 M fresh out of the army. April 17th 2013 and we are living with my wife's parents until we can get on our feet. I have been expecting my last paycheck for a while now but it seems long to come. Both of her parents are in their 70's and living on retirement checks so i feel really bad about being here. But we have no where else to go. I will have money soon but not in time for it to help. (Pulling my Tsp, Retirement) and what not. I have 1 boy 2 yrs and a pregnant wife and 2 older people, one on oxygen. I would love to be able to do something nice as a treat for them but i have no money. Anything would be amazing, I'm not saying we Need it but i would rather not eat bean soup again and give us something nice to talk over. You can call me and we can talk a bit, if you are willing to help, or even if not Just message me. Thank you in advance anyone willing to help.
954	False	a	[Gimme Pizza!!!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wusGIl3v044)
955	False	a	Here is where I say something witty or heart wrenching one to entice you,  the kind provider, to provide me with a free pizza. But its hard to be witty on an empty stomach (heart wrenching), and I would make a joke about pizza but its too cheesy (witty).   
956	True	a	we are 7 people in this house, nobody's got paid yet and our fridge is empty   my friends are trying to make bread so we don't die of starvation  http://i.imgur.com/ZrSSbVZ.jpg  we are not picky, just hungry, any kind of pizza will be appreciated  - edit: [Thanks](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1diywp/thanks_from_the_guys_in_austin_to_sgeng_and/) to Sgeng we gettin pizza right now, eternal love to you :)
957	False	a	Just a college student looking for a little cheesy goodness to survive the hell that is Finals Week. 
958	False	a	Going through a tough transition moving out of state with my three kids and was wondering if someone would be willing to supply a pizza for us tonight. I know that it would be extremely uplifting for them considering the situation. Thanks in advance. 
959	True	a	as the title says i'm a uni student in darwin, australia and due to rent and a high power bill i havent been able to buy my food shopping for this week, i wont get paid for 2 days and i've run out of staples like rice etc. if anyone can lend a hand with a RaoP i would be forever greatful &lt;3
960	False	a	buddy turned 26 last night. drank far to much because someone else was buying. did far too much drunk texting. and just to add to it. the bar tender did not know how to make a old fashioned and did not have cherrys. i crashed on his floor in his kitchen. and i am broke and in between jobs.  i am in portland oregon and have never asked for a pizza before figured i would try it out 
961	False	a	edit: (San Diego Area)  I posted today telling a bit of our little eclectic family and the situation here. Thought I would try to treat everyone to pizza to cheer them up a bit if anyone's willing. Have a great night in any case!
962	False	a	[This is also a crosspost from /r/RandomActsofPizza - I'll close that posting if I get a reply here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPizza/comments/z59hz/request_havent_eaten_in_two_days_ate_nothing_but/)  So about 3 months ago I was fired from my old job. That's normally not a problem here in Germany, but to make a VERY long story short: The government agencies that are supposed to help you out in a case such as this didn't help me out. I haven't recieved any money in 3 months. So I have been living off of left-overs some friends bring by sometime. I'm a freelance voice-actor, but I haven't gotten any contracts lately, except for a bigger one 1 1/2 weeks ago.  However, my 'boss' there hasn't paid me yet. I'm about to lose my apartment and I ran out of food.  I'm not sitting idly by though - I've been sending out CVs like crazy and have gotten an interview for next week. We'll see how that goes.  So yeah, there's the short version of what happened. I don't really know what I'm supposed to write here, sorry. If you have any question, go ahead and ask.  If anyone is actually willing to send me pizza, then there could be a minor problem seeing as I live in Germany. But - if you have a credit card (mastercard/visa) we could use [lieferando](http://www.lieferando.de). I can guide you through the ordering process via Skype for example - or I'll write something up.  If you want me to do something for the Pizza: I could record something for you.  Thanks for reading, I guess?
963	False	a	"Long time occasional lurker, first time poster here. I am 21, a recent college graduate, who managed to land a game programming job prior to graduating (and by luck my job actually pays well), however this month when trying to get ahead in tuition loan payments and spending a bit to try to get into basic electronics engineering as a hobby I managed to somehow end up in quite the situation. Due to a compounding of unexpected expenses, netflix pulling money out of the wrong (and empty) account, a rather large (at least for me) loan payment, and well simply an outright failure to budget this month... I managed to become absolutely broke aside from the bare minimum I need to get to work once this week (I work from home mostly as well).   For the past week I've been limited to the scarce quanitity of frozen meals that I bought about two weeks prior, however three weeks ago for what ever reason I acquired a large amount of soda. I ran out of food two days ago and my only intake since then has been soda. At first I was like, ""No big deal, I get paid in a few days"", but that has turned into ""MAYBE IF I USE THESE NAIL CLIPPERS I CAN CARVE A HOLE IN THIS 360 CONTROLLER TO LIVE IN THIS SODA CAN COLLECTION"" mental instability.  Long story short, I have no karma, no food, but get paid in about 3-6 days (my job is slowly moving to direct deposit but hasn't set me up yet...) and I would really like a pizza. In exchange, I'd be more than willing to pay you back as soon as I get paid, or do some small task of some reasonable sort.  I prefer Dominos, a medium pizza and a ""build your own breadbowl pasta"" (usually a coupon deal online) can last me almost two days, but really I'll take whatever I can get as I'm not exactly in a position to choose.  Heres a link to my outdated blog for some loose type of verification? (I also have one of those verification system code things as well). http://www.forecourse.com  Also, what I've been 'eating' the last two-three days: http://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/392812_1674416038329_1775307151_885951_630529237_n.jpg"
964	False	a	I have an 18 month old daughter and a 3 1/2 week old daughter. I am a single mother and my oldest daughter and I have a very tight bond bc I am the only person that has ever been constant in her life. I have been doing my best with trying to show her as much attention and affection as possible after having my second daughter but I can tell that my oldest daughter is having some problems adjusting to having to share my attention with her sister. My oldest daughter loves pizza...she gets so excited everytime we have pizza and she likes to eat all of the toppings and then the crust. She also likes to paint on her high chair with the pizza sauce lol!!! I would really like to have a mommy and daughter pizza and movie night but finances are really tight now that I am trying to learn how to budget for 3 people and 2 of them are in diapers. If anyone could help out and buy gift some pizza for my baby girl so I can give her a special fun night to help show her that mommy still loves her just as much as I ever have. I will definetly pay if forward and offer to gift someone else a pizza as soon as I financially can. Thank you!!!
965	False	a	We decided to marathon this game a la middle school binge playing before he gets deployed to the Navy in 2 days. Help us out and feed us while we play through this (so far magnificent) game! :)
966	False	a	So, last summer I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease.  It's an autoimmune disorder where the body freaks out over gluten, a protein in wheat, barley and rye (And most processed foods, due to cross-contamination in factories).  Since then, I haven't been able to eat most breads, nor gluten-free foods processed in facilities where they might have gotten contaminated by something that contains gluten.  Obviously, this means pizza's out.  When I first was diagnosed, I tried to eat gluten-free pizzas - they were all absolutely terrible, and I just gave up.  I'm appealing to you guys, now.  **Pizza used to be my favorite food, and now I can't eat it.**  I live in Brooklyn, NY.  If anyone knows of a place in the borough that does decent, gluten-free pizza **that is also prepared in a celiac-friendly kitchen** (this is very important, just being made with gluten-free ingredients isn't enough), please let me know.  You don't even need to buy me any, just tell me that it exists and I'll go there myself first thing tomorrow.  Thanks for your time, redditors.  Have a slice and think of me!
967	False	a	It's been a wonderful day. I have gotten stoned and watched futurama and enjoyed my day off. But now I am broke and hungry XD. Maybe I'll get lucky and someone feels the need to help this fella out.
968	False	a	Nothing too drastic, and I can live without, but I wouldn't say no to a pizza right now. 
969	False	a	I'm a student who lives off a mix of my student loans and funds from my summer job. I got laid off 3 weeks ago and since it's summer, I have no school money coming in and am trying to stretch what little money I have left. This means a steady diet of rice, beans and ramen and I'm dieing for some variety. I can send some proof in a PM if requested. 
970	False	a	Hey reddit, this has basically been the worst week of my life. My car window was broken, I'm looking at being evicted from my gf's parents house, making us both homeless, and my snake that I've had since birth just got eaten by a cat. We're not allowed to eat the food in the kitchen an I can't afford any food. Help?
971	False	a	I work for a section of my university that cleans windows. They have been trying to shut us down for a while since we don't bring in money just cost it. We had a meeting with our boss and she Informed us that we will not have jobs after this week. We where told the reason why was no room in the budget. Well I don't have room in my budget to not get a pay check anymore. Thank you for helping and thank you for listening. 
972	False	a	I wil draw you something for a pizza.  I will sing.    I will try and make you laugh.  Help you on a homework question.      (Im horrible at all of these things.)
973	False	a	I'm going to try to be very clear and straightforward.  I was out of work for a few weeks and unfortunately I recently ran out of cash.  The good thing is that I started working again this week but I won't be getting paid for another week.  After losing my job I felt hopeless but now I'm hopeful that things are starting to turn around.  I would certainly appreciate it if I was able to get a pizza because my kitchen is completely empty.  As soon as I'm able to I'm going to be sure to return the favor to someone else as often as possible.  I wouldn't feel comfortable receiving it if I didn't know I would do the same for someone else.
974	False	a	Hey Guys. Anyone cares to help me out with a pizza, i am really dying for one right now and i can't really afford it. I study music by the way :-)  
975	False	a	First things first: I'm twenty and I live with my mother. In tennessee. There's pretty much a whole lot of things out of reach for me due to the fact of residential areas being in the asscrack of nowhere. I'm an amateur game developer who's studying to actually start developing but can't really do that without fuel for attentionspan. It's complicated. Anyway, if you send me pizza, I'll credit you by reddit username in obnoxiously huge, flashing letters in my first kongregate submission, Snap into a genocide (whose gameplay is completely unrelated to the title). And if you're a pretty rad dude for lack of a better agendered word, we can be friends. and-- while I would love any pizza, pizza hut's kinda gross in this area. I live in shannon glen, which is in spring hill. I encourage you to googlemaps it and see why I'm requesting. Thanks!
976	False	a	    I feel really down that it has come to this but, I have been out of work 3 weeks now and money is really scarce.  During this stressful time I wish to have a night of relaxing and a nice pizza.  The hunt for a new job has and still is quite challenging.  Food is pretty tight as well and I am waiting for my food stamp app to get accepted.  If you feel like helping you would be doing me a nice nice favor. 
977	True	a	Sunnyside NY to be specific! Never tried RAOP before. Will return the favor to someone else. I'm using my reddit account that's nearly 5 years old so you can hold me accountable
978	False	a	I haven't seen my best friend in over 5 years. I was finally in the area, and gave him a call, but he lived really far away. I scrounged up all the gas money I could to go see him, and ended up with just enough for there and back. He is a poor college kid, and has no food (his girlfriend and him have an arrangement.) Please help us relive the glory of our teenage years. Message me for address.
979	False	a	I hate these damn noddles! I think I'm going to dry up like when you put salt on a snail. Any pie can be helpful, I've been eating them for about 3 weeks already and I'm annoyed with life.
980	False	a	I could give you some sob story, but really I'm just poor and hungry. but welcome to my life as a broke college student. 
981	True	a	She's 3, wants pizza, and mommy is broke. Will post a picture of her three year old pizza face if you buy us lunch :)
982	False	a	Hello, I've been a longtime lurker on reddit and finally made an account a few weeks back.. since then my life has absolutely been turned upside down.   After this semester [full time] at university I lost my job. I had barely paid off this semester via payment plan when I received the VOICEMAIL informing me I was no longer needed at work.   The issues created by not having money for my bills and gas caused major problems with my parents, who had been letting me live at home this last semester on the condition I would finish my degree and sustain myself financially regarding everything but the roof over my head. Needless to say, they do not really have the means to support another person and I left because of this strain.  I have been couch crashing this last week at a friends' with literally nothing to offer him (or his awesome, understanding roommates who I really just met) in return for their hospitality. A PIZZA!! =) to share with these great people would not only be the first whole meal I have had for a while, but it would go a long way towards making me feel a bit better about myself for actually contributing to this house a bit. The other folks here are all struggling students, and looking in the pantry all I'm seeing is ramen and potatoes (lol).   Thanks for putting up with this wall of text, I felt obligated to give the whole story! Not sure of what evidence is necessary but needless to say if you ask for it I will provide. I hope I did this right (got a confirmation code as well if needed) but here goes heh. Take care!  EDIT! we are in Albuquerque, NM, USA 87114. Thanks chupanibre25 =)
983	False	a	I've recently graduated university. I think I have a pretty decent resume (working on a successful political campaign, interning at a Congressional office, etc) but I cannot for the life of me find a job. Not having a car in a very difficult city to commute in is definitely a problem, but it doesn't stop me from taking the bus. But I can only go so far. A two hour bus ride makes an 8 hour day become a 12 hour day. And scheduling multiple interviews is difficult when I'm relying on the bus to take me. Nevertheless, I'm still pushing through and hoping that if nothing, Walmart will come through.  So yeah, I have to move out by August 1st. My roommates want me to sign a new lease at a different apartment complex to move in by July 22nd, but I don't know that I can do it. I'm almost absolutely broke and it really sucks. It's a mixture of embarrassing, frustrating, and sad. I don't want to move back home but I don't know what to do. I feel like I graduated and I did a lot right to secure a decent job or prospects, but I guess I didn't. I'm studying for the LSAT and I'll take it in October. I plan on scoring well enough to go to a good law school, but that's so far away.  I dunno, I'm rambling. What's up RAOP?
984	False	a	Long time lurker here... As the title says, I've been living off of the dollar menu for the past two weeks on change I've saved up. I ran out of change yesterday, and I don't get paid until Tuesday. The only thing I want is at least one decent meal until then.  Anyone who helps me out will get a pizza when I get my check and one internet hug :D
985	True	a	Hi guys, never done this before so I don't know if it will work or not but worth a shot is it not? Basically the situation is as follows.. I am in Wellington, New Zealand. I am hungover because last night I was out in town drinking and watching the warriors lose to manly in the NRL grand final :( used up most of my spare money taxing home and now I am looking at a fairly empty fridge/pantry.. My car is 30 mins walk away and it is PISSING down with rain which I don't really wanna brave to go to the super market.  Pretty much wondering if a kickass random stranger would hook me up with a pizza to cure my hangover and cheer me up after yesterdays loss. Will be sure to pay it on in the future to another needy individual.  Thankyou THR - you are the greatest!
986	True	a	i am a single disabled woman who does not have much spending money. i would love a pizza for my 46th birthday! i like supreme or deluxe pizza, but any kind would be a welcome surprise! thank you :)
987	False	a	My Girlfriend doesn't believe there are actually people who would give away pizzas. So as a bet, I told her if someone wanted to send one, she has to take a picture for the ROAP sender... There choice, anything goes. Can send pictures of what were working with upon request. 1 Time Deal!
988	False	a	I'm here in hopes of pizza!  I don't have many talents, but I can try to do handstands again!  Food is much appreciated!  
989	False	a	Hi my name is unimportant, i am 19 and from the internet. i am also high and find myself in need for a pizza but have no funds to go twards this pizza i think i might have 42 cents in my bank account i live in your freezer and watch you while you sleep. i could really use a random act of pizza. thank you redit. 
990	False	a	Hi RAoP, my fianc√©e and I are both unemployed and are scraping along the moment with very little money. And since it is near the end of the month, we have even less.  It's a Saturday night and frankly we are starving! We don't have much/any food in the house we can eat, we live by ourselves and no family nearby that we can count on.  I know some people on here offer something small in exchange for the pizza (noticed one guy on here offered a rap xD), the only thing we can offer is really my fianc√©e might be able to do a little drawing for you (she's a good artist), or I can offer a spare copy of a game on Steam.  I know there are some good people out there on reddit and I hope one of them sees this.  I have 2 job interviews next week, if I get either of them, after my first pay I will come back on here and buy someone else in need a pizza. It's only fair.  Thank you and sorry for the slight wall of text.  Also, just in case, we are in the UK.
991	True	a	~~So here is the deal, Im stuck at work on a 12hr shift over night in a completely empty 12 story high rise. I dont have enough cash to order pizza ($6) and nothing close enough that i can afford(even if i did sneak away i.e. McD/Jacnk in the box/taco bell). Can pay it forward in the future~~  No longer needed thanks /u/Full-Flavor
992	False	a	Dont really have a sob story... just moved into a new place, the start up fees for all my utilities and internet left me broke until my next paycheck. Hoping i could find a pizza to tide me over, planning to pay it forward when i get my paycheck this week.   also, i'll draw anything you want. poorly.  im in scranton, PA
993	False	a	I hope I am doing this correctly. I do not have any  tear jerker story. Husband is working a double , children got their shots today and I would love to get pizza for them, it's not within our budget Thank you for taking the time consider my request We are a family of 5 but all i really care about if if the children are treated since they were quite brave. I will treat others to some pizza when my budget sees fit.
994	True	a	We just moved to a completely unfamiliar area, car broke down during the move, it's just been one thing after another so I'm not even going to go into it all. We could really use a pizza if anyone would be so obliging.
995	False	a	I'm a broke musician/artist guy. Money is (always) tight and a pie would be pretty tight butthole. Not expecting anything here, so grateful for whatever comes my way. 
996	False	a	EDIT:  I live in Cleveland, Ohio  So, here's my story. I've been browsing reddit for quite awhile, not posting much, but constantly upvoting cool or funny stories. TIL that there's a subreddit for people to pay forward pizza. So, here we are. For the past two paychecks, I've been dead broke, paying bills. I still have to pay 300$ to my ex, 200$ to my credit card, 100$ this month for bills, and then yesterday i got four tickets, two in my moms name, and two in my aunts, for stuff I couldn't take care of at the beginning of the month. Grass, because I had no mower, and trash because people keep running over my trash cans. So I have no idea what im going to do about those yet. I'll probably have to end up paying them. As if that wasn't bad enough, it's my turn to cook for myself, and my two friends who are living with me trying to help me keep the place clean. For the past week they've been cooking delicious meals filled with juicy chicken and scrumptious ground beef. So... I would feel kind of bad just making ramen for them. So, two pizzas would go a long way. Fortunately, on this upcoming check, I have 5 hours of overtime pay, so I would be more than happy to push back the creditcard bill for a little while to return the favor. The deed doesn't need to be done for another 4-10 hours, I just figured that I would post it now so it could get some time to be noticed. Thanks in advance.  TL;DR. Got 99 problems, but paying back a nice favor ain't one. Or Have ridiculous bills to pay, city is fucking me over with four tickets for two offenses that I corrected weeks ago, and it's my turn to provide food, but all I have left to cook is ramen, and a dollar bill. Getting 5 hours overtime on payday, and can easily return the favor.   That text was copy pasta'd from r/randomactsofpizza, seeing as how I didn't know this was the real one.  More info:  One of my roommates figured out that I posted this, and he's fine with cooking until I get paid, but I would still like to give them a break on cooking for a day, or possibly two if I happen to get 2 pizzas.  Plus, I would really like to pay it forward.  So, it's RAOP's call.  :]  Pizza would be nice, but I suppose not 100% needed.  Once again, thanks in advance.
997	False	a	Basically my car isnt running at the moment due to vandalism ive lost my job as a pizza delivery driver from that , girlfriend is out drinking with guys probably going to cheat on me tonight been stuck at home for the last week and there is no food going hungry and a random act of kindness would really boost my morale
998	False	a	Broke, My company is going bankrupt and owes me three weeks pay, I would appreciate some Pizza for me and my two kids..  Thank you
999	True	a	My bank account is empty and I can't leave the house because I am waiting for a roommate's package from UPS.  If someone would generously send a pizza I would happily pass it forward next week.
1000	False	a	I'm working on a project with friends all night and all he has in his fridge is orange juice? What the hell I know right. Bring us pizza and make us happy and full! Kosher please (no meats) any veggies are fine. 
1001	False	a	Horrible day at work, shitty relationship, and roommates from hell. I just want to believe in life again! Please make my night. 
1002	False	a	I am new to this my mother told me about it this morning when i came running to her house because i woke up and went to go make my two boys eggs and my burner wouldn't turn on so i have it set to where i can get it back on friday but until my friend comes and picks the boys up for me i can not cook anything for them so if someone could please help they dont get picked up until around six-ish.
1003	False	a	well im not going to make somthing up for a pizza, pizza sounds good.
1004	False	a	Hi!  Hopefully someone can help me out, I'm starving and exhausted. Been applying for jobs consistently, luckily I have a job interview tomorrow - but I'm broke. A pizza tonight would make my weekend and my day tomorrow!  Oh, and lovely subreddit as well. :) You're all spectacular folks.
1005	False	a	I'm hungry and I don't have anything to eat other than potatoes, would love a pizza. Thanks in advance.
1006	True	a	Nope, no sad story, I'm just looking for a pie.  
1007	False	a	hey there RAoP,  i'm an undergraduate Computational Media major at Georgia Tech, which pretty much means i'm a Computer Science major except I specialize in things like film, user interfaces, video games, stuff like that. i'm directing a fifteen-minute horror movie for my english class, and i've been sick the past couple of days (which is a double bummer because we've had monday and tuesday off) so i'm in OVERDRIVE mode. i have all the work i can possibly do for tonight done and i'm just exhausted and still a little under the weather. i have also forgotten to eat today, and my meal plan is full for the week so i can't go to the dining halls :(  if there are unfulfilled [REQUEST]s from mothers with children or people who are literally starving please get me off the front page as fast as you possibly can, but if anyone can spare a pizza for a starving artist that would be awesome. i'll even put you in the credits of the movie under 'special thanks' if you want :p  i can provide a link to the course website as well as a picture of me outside the dorm as verification.  pizza or no pizza, have a great night, everyone!
1008	False	a	I've been going through a bit of a rough summer, emotionally. I feel unmotivated and uninspired. To top it off, the other day my parents told me they don't think I'm ever going to make it in college... what a way to bring someone down. We had a huge fight and I'm currently at my boyfriend's house. I haven't had a delicious pizza made to my perfection in a long, long time and I'm desperately searching for something to lift my spirits.  *In return for a pizza, I will photoshop a panda bear with a machine gun wearing a beer hat, and holding a pizza, riding on a tyrannosaurus rex with a huge explosion in the background.*  Thanks! 
1009	False	a	Hey all,  title pretty much explains it.  My first paycheck isn't until thursday so I'm broke and hungry until then. When I do get paid you can count on me to pay it forward. Thanks :) 
1010	False	a	Hey guys today I worked for the first time in over a year and will do again tomorrow (Unfortunately this is only a one off Job and I may not get another for a while). However it feels great to have worked again and I'll be earning some cash in hand money tomorrow :D. Anyways I would love a pizza and would reciprocate as soon as possible (But seeing as I don't have a job and the money for this will go towards paying rent to my family -Recent college (high school) leaver it probably won't be for quite a while) cheers! TL;DR Worked first day in over a year one off thing would love an happy time pizza.
1011	False	a	Hello I am posting another request I have not got pizza d yet and I am trying it agian..I am out of food right now and I am very hungry dont get paid until tomorrow will someone help me eat tonight please ..Hopeing i will get pizzad tonight thanks..Will return the favor when i get payed tomorrow thanks
1012	False	a	Hello RAoP,  Today I knew when I woke up I should just go back to sleep, but against my better judgement, I hopped right up and went to class.  I've been having car trouble for the past two weeks, but I got a new fuel pump put in last week and I was fine.  Until today.  I broke down at a red light on my way to work, where I was hoping to make tip money and eat. This was unsuccessful, as my car broke down again about a mile from my house on my way there.   I completely wiped out my bank account last week fixing it + the tow  today, so any help you guys can offer would be greatly appreciated!
1013	False	a	3 lads wanting some pizza, will post pictures of us doing things for your amusement in return. we shall be your picture slaves. 
1014	True	a	Had some really bad days lately. I'm really down on my luck. A pizza would really make my day better.
1015	True	a	We are a cool group of three folks that are super hungry and unfortunately we are all out of food! One of us is getting food stamps in two days but in the meantime a delicious internet pizza would Rule!
1016	False	a	Hey guys,  It's been a shitty day at work, we don't even have enough money to buy paper towels, my cat is sick and I just give up on today. I'd really appreciate it if someone could buy me and my boyfriend dinner. I give up on today.
1017	False	a	Pretty much what the title says. Felt a little stress from the weekend (relationship problems), so I decided to unwind a little bit with some weed. Now I'm feeling the munchies and I realize that I've got no food in the house, and I'm not okay to drive to go out and get money or anything. A pizza would be very appreciated. Located on the East Coast of the US, thanks for your time. Any Ents here?
1018	False	a	**EDIT**: fark, I'm slow and forgot to post my location. I'm in Virginia.  First of, Happy Labor Day! I hope everyone has had an awesome day.  Like the post says, I simply lack the energy today to cook. I tried taking Effexor (an anti-depressant drug) and it didn't go well for me (lots of nausea and loss of appetite) so I decided to not take take it anymore. Of course, going off of an anti-depressant makes you kind of moody and that's where I am now.   So, I'm here in hopes that someone will toss a pizza my way.   P.S.: if you need verification, I can send you a verification code as well as a picture of the pills/pill bottle.
1019	False	a	I just found this site through CNN.  I am deeply touched reading all of these posts.  Both from those in need, and those looking to help.  It is amazing to see people helping each other this way.  There was a point when getting a pizza meant nothing.  It was more of an escape from cooking for the night then a special treat.  Those days are long gone.  In the last year I've gone through a divorce and lost my job.  I do get unemployment, but I'm $500 in the negative every month with just the standard bills, not counting gas or food.  It's a round robin of who gets payed each month based on the impending shut-off notice.  TV service is long gone, and we wouldn't have the internet if not for it being a major part of the job hunt.  We've learned to live on what we have, and I'm grateful to say my kids are too young to fully appreciate where are at four and five.  I make sure they're fed, but I can never give them anything above and beyond that.  It would just be really amazing to be able to surprise them with a pizza some night.  Believe me, I know how fortunate I am to have a roof over our heads, and a car that works right most of the time.  And there are people I'm sure who need so much more than we do.  And as soon as I'm in a position to help them, I guarantee I'm going to be on here doing that.  God bless all of you.
1020	True	a	I spent all my money on booze for the next week without realizing the fact that I'd need food too... I'm a retard. So! A pizza would be much appreciated. :)
1021	False	a	On Friday night, there I was sitting in my pajamas, eating ice cream when I get a text from a couple friends asking me to come out for wings and a drink with them. I agree and get ready quickly. We get there, order our drinks and food, chatting and everything. We get our drinks and are waiting for our food. Now, we were sitting in a booth and I had my back to the window and I was sitting on the outside. Soooo...all the sudden a car crashes through the building in reverse, pinning me between the booth and the table. I was the only person injured. Within about 24 hours of that all happening, my already insane mother disowns me and encourages me to kill myself (unrelated to the accident) even after I had just had a near death experience. I am now taking a bit of time off work, which I can't afford to do.    So anyway there's a fun story for you, reddit. I would just love to be pizza'd today. 
1022	False	a	"I got laid off on Monday from my blue-collar job I've had for years. My boss said that it's hopefully a temporary cost-cutting measure,  and I'll probably be hired back in the fall when production picks up, and I believe him. Things always pick back up in the fall.   I have a little bit of money saved up, but I stress about the long term.   For the last year, it's just been me and my 2 wonderful girls, A. (6) and P.(9).  Their mom left last year due to with her drug abuse (First perscription opiates, then heroin). After 3 rounds of 28-day  treatment (one of them court-ordered), I kicked her out... I had to, I couldn't bear to have the girls see her in the state she was in 99% of the time; if not high, then dope-sick and angry. She occasionally will pop up and visit, but I know she's still using.  Long story short: My kids aren't exactly starving, but they havent had a pizza night with dad in quite a long time. I'm hoping we can sit on the floor as a family in front of the tv, put in ""How to Train Your Dragon"", chow down, and forget about stuff for a couple of hours.   P.S. Obvious throwaway, I didn't want to post with my regular account, as I'm a regular poster/commenter, and not a lurker."
1023	False	a	I'm currently getting over being sick for the entire weekend. It doesn't help that I managed to completely screw myself over money-wise. (It's a long story of a 20 year old failing at personal finance) I'm currently spending a summer doing research at a university in Pittsburgh, but need enough money to drive back home in a week. This basically leaves me with a $0 food budget :(  If anyone is willing to help, once I get back on my feet (in 2 weeks I'll be home and get another paycheck), I'll definitely pay it forward. 
1024	False	a	reposted to follow posting guidelines  I was invited but we have one car and it doesn't fit everyone and im always left out. but i could always go for my own pizza at home! thanks for reading let me know if i did anythign wrong guys
1025	False	a	My boyfriend recently crashed his car and its going to cost $500 to fix it. We also have to buy new tires which will be another $500. I'd be grateful for anything you guys can offer and I promise to pay it forward as soon as I can.
1026	False	a	I've heard of Random Acts of Pizza but never actually used it.  Right now it's getting into the later afternoon and I gotta say...I'm tired.  Payday is tomorrow and my stomach is hating the ramen I've been eating the last few days.  It would honestly make my entire day to have a filling, hot meal tonight.  I would love to pay it forward as soon as I have money in hand.    Can anyone help me out?  EDIT:  Aw crud, I'm such a noob.  I left my location out of the title.  Sorry guys.  I'm in Bakersfield, California
1027	False	a	Today has been so bad today. On my way to work my battery light came on.. later on I found out my alternator went bad. Then on my way home my car died on the side of the road and I had to use the last bit of money to tow it home. I dont know yet how Im gonna get to work tomorrow. A pizza would really make this day better for me if anyone out there can help at all... I'll give you a kiss on the cheek :)
1028	True	a	Lost my job (was a manager at a hookah bar) due to the owner selling the shop. He overextended opening too many businesses and had to sell off a lot of places, including the shop I ran for him. I've spent the entire day updating my resume and applying for jobs. Any help would be awesome :)
1029	True	a	Hello RAOP  I have an old friend in town this weekend. He is stopping by later today to watch some football and hang out for a while. I have no real food in my house to offer while he is over here, and I don't get paid until the end of the week. I hate to be a bad host, could anyone help me out with a delicious pizza to feed us growing men? I will be paying it forward regardless at the end of the week.  I live in Wilmington, DE (Right outside Philadelphia). I have all the majors around, Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Johns.  Thanks for considering helping me out!!
1030	False	a	My check from work has yet to come in. I only have about 66 cents in my bank account right now and the only thing I have to eat in my apartment is some mustard...very sad. Clearly I need to go get groceries, but until then could someone send me a pizza?? I would pay it forward eventually.
1031	False	a	This was my favorite short term promotion and its back! I don't have the money otherwise I would buy it myself. Thanks for reading my post and have an awesome day!
1032	False	a	My mother just found out that because of my minimum wage job that I work on the weekends we will no longer be receiving food stamps. Although they gave us $300 a month for food I am only making a little over $100 for my own personal teenage expenses. (Clothes, school things, going out, savings, etc.) We are all really craving some Dominoes and it'd be awesome if someone wanted to help out! (:
1033	False	a	If some generous soul is awesome enough to buy me a pizza tonight, I will either:  a) Buy someone else a pizza when I've got the cash (pay it forward and all)  **OR**  b) Play you a song. I play tuba! I can also play guitar/bass decently, nothing special though.    *Disclaimer: I'm not a very good singer.*  Your choice!  I live in Southern CA.
1034	False	a	This is my first time using this subreddit. I don't have an elaborate sob story, but I can say that payday is Friday and i will gladly return the favor. O:-)   I don't exactly know how this works, so please be patient with me as I learn. :-)
1035	False	a	Never done this but, I was trying to get home this weekend for the holiday in daytona, but my car broke down and wont be fixed till AFTER the holiday weekend! dont have any money to eat since i put it all into getting my car fixed! $220 So hungry, please help! 
1036	False	a	Just a broke college student alone on a Saturday night that could use the company of a warm pizza
1037	True	a	I love my girlfriend very much but unfortunately I have no money what so ever to buy her anything for her birthday today! She has been saying that she craved pizza for the last couple of days, as much as she might like my gift of music, it isn't a pizza...  I was hoping one of you kind redditors might be able to fulfill the pizza wish! I know that if fulfilled it would make my GF the happiest and I will post pictures of us eating it together :D
1038	False	a	I've been emotionally rocky the last few days.  Being around people has been very upsetting to me the last few days, I just got off work about an hour and a half ago and had to immediately find a quiet spot outside to break down for half an hour.  I'm sure this is just stress, I moved/graduated/got a new job recently and don't have any close friends in my new area yet (besides a college friend who thankfully moved to this area too).  I'm taking the night off to stay in and heal.  It would be awesome to be able to nibble on a pizza while doing so.  Promise I'll pay it forward in the near future.
1039	False	a	Unfortunately, dominos doesn't take paypal :P I'm in canada if that matters. I posted this earlier, but I thikn it got hooked by the spam filter
1040	False	a	Doubt any one will do this, but im too broke, and hungry. Check out my gonewild pics. 
1041	False	a	"EDIT: I don't need the pizza now. I got it taken care of.   My friends and I are going to have a pizza party for the Oscars tonight and I was going to use the free pizza I had saved for the coin toss. So I go on to the papa john's website to order my pizza to pick on the way to my friends house tonight but it tells me ""The promo code you entered has exceeded the maximum allowed usage"" but I haven't used it yet. I called customer service but I got a busy signal. After a few tries, I gave up. Because it's my cake day and I love the Oscars, I thought someone might have sympathy for me.   But, if someone thinks I can get this fixed once I get a hold of customer service, I'll keep trying but I don't know how to prove I didn't already use it. I mean, my order history will be blank bc I created the account to use the code but other than that, I don't know what to tell them. If I can get this fixed then I won't need/accept an offer from you guys.   EDIT: Finally got through to customer service and we got it worked out. They gave me a new code. Thanks to anyone who considered helping me out. I'll try to pizza someone in the future when I have the means. "
1042	False	a	Roommates and girlfriend out of town, sitting here broke with out pizza. If it happens, it happens, and I'll be eternally grateful. If it doesn't happen I'll eat something else.
1043	False	a	Like the title says I'm a broke college kid that's working on a paper. I could do with something a little better than beef ramen if possible. I'll be sure to pay it forward when I start my summer job here in a few weeks. 
1044	True	a	Tomorrow is his 5 birthday and I want to do something to celebrate it. Im not old enough to get a job (14) and my dad has no money :( Will someone help me out? God bless however took the time to read this, and have a good day everyone.
1045	True	a	I got pizza'd, thanks Lexically. 
1046	False	a	So first of all, this account IS a throwaway. Truth be told, I'm embarrassed I'm at this point again, and also, my good friends have my actual account info and I'd just rather them not know I'm here. I have received pizza here once before. My first Reddit cakeday was in August. I'm more than willing to link someone to my real account and provide some sort of proof that I am who I say I am. I just don't want everyone to know! Though I am willing to give thanks from my real account. It's a different feeling, afterwards.  Okay if you made it past that, the short story is that I'm, like most, out of money. I get paid on Friday but until then I'm scavenging. I'm a kind hearted person but I know there are tons of people deserving of food! I'm just hoping someone takes pity on me. Pretty please! I'd be so grateful.  TL:DR - Pizza?  Edit: I live in Washington State.
1047	True	a	We moved to Austin recently, and our spare food money was in a PayPal account. We overlooked that our PayPal debit card expired back in April. We've contacted PayPal already, and the debit card is in the mail, and should be arriving tomorrow. All we have until then is several packs of Ramen noodles. Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Edit: I have someone calling in an order for me, for which I am grateful.  Edit2: I have the pizza on the way. Thanks go to gratefulstringcheese!
1048	False	a	My very first post on Reddit was to give a pizza! Now I'm in an apartment with friends with nearly two feet of snow outside, and we'd love to share a big pepperoni. Unfortunately we don't have any big chains nearby, just local pizzerias, but I'm happy to verify, share silly photos, whatever you'd like.
1049	False	a	It's her 21st birthday and I wanna surprise her with a pizza for her inevitable drunk munchies. That's pretty much the jist of it, but let me know if you want more details.
1050	True	a	My daughter just recently started kindergarten, and after lots of worrying she seems to be doing really well. (She's a trooper!) I promised her a special dinner this week and she'd specifically requested pizza, but I had some unexpected bills and now pizza isn't really an option.  It would really make her week and mine if someone would throw us a pie (and possibly some breadsticks--she loves dipping!)  Thanks for reading! 
1051	False	a	hi! looking for some dinner tonight. i've recently started on a job hunt since getting my degree a couple weeks and haven't found success. sadly, i'm starting to go low on cash. i'll make sure to pass on the favor when i've making my own money. thanks!
1052	True	a	I was just hit with an unknown council tax bill for ¬£200 which wiped out my months wages. If anybody would be kind enough to get me one i will repay with one at the month.
1053	False	a	"I figure that between a pizza and the rice that I have left that I can eat at least until I visit my family for Christmas. I've set aside the money it will take me to catch a bus to join everyone for this ""holiday tradition"", but buying anymore food will be very tight until about Jan. 2nd, when my next paycheck comes in. Happy holidays to everyone regardless of anything else. You people are all amazing and I wish you all the best!      This is an Xpost from r/randomactsofpizza"
1054	False	a	Hi guys, I am a broke college student who has been living off of ramen and eggs for the better part of 2 weeks now.   I have a gig tomorrow that is paying well, but I had my last bag of ramen today and wont have any more food until tomorrow. I tried to make it last, but I'm at the point where I have finally swallowed my pride.  Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.  Thank you - duitse
1055	False	a	Upon inspection there's been money taken from my account. This is not going to plan.
1056	False	a	Have a craving for a sausage and mushroom pizza. Had a long day at work and just want to sit and eat and drink a beer. Hope everyone is having a great night! 
1057	True	a	Hey! My mother's AWOL, and I have no money; the oven's broken, and I'm feeling pretty depressed. I don't want to have to eat a bread-and-butter sandwich for dinner again tonight, and I'd really like a random act of pizza.  Would anyone feel kind enough to buy me a pizza/give me a gift card/code? As stated in the title, I'm in the United Kingdom.  Even if not,  I love you, Reddit. Every single one of you.
1058	False	a	I'm so hungry and don't have money and would be so beyond happy to get a pizza from a kind person such as yourself,I am an artist I will draw you a beautiful picture showing my appreciation. &lt;3.   SORRY. Forgot to put, VISTA,CALIFORNIA. Thanks. 
1059	True	a	Here's a pic of Buster: http://i.imgur.com/jgnOY.jpg
1060	False	a	Its my first time posting on the subreddit so please forgive if anything is done improperly. We're 23 both freelance workers, though we're currently looking for other jobs since there have been less and less gigs as time passes. Moneys been tight. Thought some warm pizza would be a nice pick me up.
1061	False	a	So this isn't quite the usual post but me and my friends broke out the old N64 tonight and were playing some Harvest Moon, we had gotten as far as building the second story to our house when my N64 shut off!! and now it won't even boot back up... we're totally bummed out, and if any of you guys know how we feel, we'd love a pizza right now. Thanks in advance
1062	False	a	So we're having a house show. And pizza boxes make our lineup. So what better to have pizza at our pizza party house show. This one is 12 bands. Help feed hungry musicians and a house full of people with a pizza!
1063	False	a	My flatmate and I are both doing secondary degrees and have assignments due tomorrow. We're also a bit short of cash. In fact she has several things due, thanks to outside circumstances, and is rather suffering so she could definitely do with a little cheering up. Me? I just like pizza and could really do with the extra motivation. Thanks for reading :) 
1064	False	a	Hey, all.  I'm down to $5 in my checking account.  $10 to Dominos would allow me and my roommate to eat tonight.  We're both good guys, just have more bills than pay this week.  Hours got cut and rent is due.  Tomorrow we get to hit up the food pantry, but something tonight would be wonderful, if anyone can swing it.  Thanks.
1065	False	a	sunday funday at m buddys im to broke to get a pizza and to high not to get a pizza please help me will send shit in return
1066	False	a	I would gladly repay or pay it forward depending on which you prefer, maybe even both. But like it says my gf was put on bed rest and im trying to take care of her and working 12 hour days so it makes it kinda hard...
1067	False	a	I did a summer abroad trip to Europe this year. Cool, right? I had to take out several private loans to cover expenses at home, like rent, while I was away. To make a long story short, my financial aid advisor boned me and only gave me above 66% of my private loan -- saying I had sufficient funds. I convinced my generous grandparents to loan me some money for my flight home. The cheapest I could find was a couple cities away. After eating nothing but bread and fruit the last several weeks and being couped up in this hostel all day I am finally going home tomorrow!!!!   All I want is to go home and if I can get a nice American pie then thatd be great, too! It has been too long since Ive had a pizza! I live in Buffalo if that helps. 
1068	False	a	Been eating Ramen and mac n cheese for the past 3 weeks , im not sure if its good for me but i would like something else. Im looking for a job and have been for 2 months so all the money i get has to go to bills and rent.  Some pizza would be awesome right about now.
1069	False	a	I know this is cliche, but I got into a car accident and getting it fixed emptied my account. I need the car to allow me to get to school and work. I am 300$ short on rent and am trying to sell of any non essentials in my apt. I have no food in my apt other than the condiments in my fridge. I hate asking but help would be greatly appreciated, and when i get back on my feet I would be glad to pay back the favor.  Im in San Marcos TX  If you want pics of the car, just ask. 
1070	True	a	Anyone willing to order us a pizza just for today? Even a small pizza will make a difference, we're just really really hungry and ran out of food earlier than we expected, Our checks come tomorrow so we Will help thos in need  Thanks a bunch reddit
1071	True	a	Just another college student going through exams, a nice meaty pizza would make my day.  Whatever I may receive I will pay forward a pizza of at least equal awesomeness to somebody else when I have the means to do so.
1072	False	a	"Howdy everyone! You doin' alright?   This is my first post, and I'm not sure if I'm doin' this right (oh please correct me if I'm doing it wrong!) but here goes, here's why I wish I had a pizza right now (prepare for dramalama):   **The worst:** I just had to tell this girl, the sweetest, funnest, cutest one you could ever imagine, that I didn't feel the same way about her that she did about me. Yes, I would sing her praises yet don't reciprocate, why? I've known her since we were kids, and since we've grown up, I absolutely can't see her as anything more than a little sister. She's never been quite lucky in love, and every fiber of my being knows she deserves more than a ""no"" from anyone, yet I can't be the one to do it -- I would be lying to myself and to her. Uggghhh, seeing her in this state, and knowing I caused it, is really taking it's toll on me. I've been dreaming about her, and even in my dreams I can't feel the same way, making me wake up only an hour or two into my sleep and unable to go back to sleep due to feeling so miserable.   **The kind-of okay:** Aside from that, I simply don't have any food in the house right now, and my only ride out of this mountainous region isn't coming until (hopefully?) tomorrow, so that I may go get groceries.   So, not having pizza in a long-ass time, I feel like one would definitely bring an umbrella to this raincloud party, as well as tie me over until my friend gets back up here. What say you, friend?"
1073	True	a	Hello RAoP! We are  Canadian University students who are very hungry and very broke! One of us also plays guitar and will cover any song you want as long as its not something too obscure.
1074	False	a	I'm writing a term paper for my Cultural Anthropology class.  It's about Hasidic Jews, and how they interact with the secular world in selective ways, as well as how Hasidic girls try to fit in by selectively imitating secular women.  It's long and rough...       I don't have any meal swipes left and am out of money in my bank account until I go back home and work some more.  I would greatly appreciate a pizza...  And if you are interested I could send you a copy of my essay.  for late night reading i guess.
1075	False	a	Hey guys, first post here. Thought someone would be cool enough to help me out when im down on my luck. Also open to trades. Dont have much but i can fit to work in my area if any manual labor is needed.
1076	False	a	I'm home by myself and I am on house arrest, so I cannot leave my house. I have absolutely nothing to eat in my pantry or my fridge. Just canned pumpkin spice:(. If someone would like to help me out I would be very grateful and will pass the giving along to someone else in need when I have the means to. This is my first request from a fellow Redditor, and actually any food is appreciated. I can provide proof of my ankle bracelet which prevents me from leaving.( On house arrest for too many curfew tickets. Which is bull****.) I will also make you a video of when I receive the pizza and how grateful I am.    Location details:  I live in Southern Orange county, San Juan Capistrano area. Close to mission viejo and laguna hills.    Also, I do not come from a family of money so I would give an honest appreciation to anyone taking any notice to this. I just want some food. My stomach hurts and there's nothing I can do about it. I have no money and no other way of getting food.
1077	True	a	Freelance worker here, currently my funds are all stuck in PayPal. I'm willing to do a fair trade if somebody can order me a pizza! I'm willing to pay double for the order!
1078	False	a	"Well where do I start? Two years ago the love of my life dumped me because for 6 months before that I had become a drinking machine. It wasn't just when I was depressed. I would drink when I was happy, sad, hungry, tired, stressed. I would even go to work and school drunk. It became a major problem when I got alcohol poisoning. To keep her from leaving I agreed to quit drinking completely and start going to meetings. Suprisingly, it worked and I was on the fast track to living a much better (happier) booze free lifestyle. In the past month my girlfriend and I have argued constantly. Thursday night she confessed she had been cheating on me for about three months with my bestfriend, who had also helped me stop drinking. My gf left after that, she came home three hours later reaking of vodka and she had vomit in her hair, in her inebriation she told me how her and my bestfriend had been sneaking around partying together and ""one thing just lead to another"" and they had fallen inlove. This had come to me as a shock because not even 2 months ago she had agreed to help me take care of my brother when I got custody of him. Yesterday she left me she said she'd be back for her things. I tried to go about my day the way I would any other day, I went to my AA meeting got my 24 months sober token. I went to work and got through the day as best I could crying in the bathroom on my lunch break. After work I went to the bank to withdrawl money to pay my bills, only to find out she took all my money out of my bank account 20 minutes after my check was direct deposited. I didn't know what else to do. I wont be able to pay my bills or buy food. I don't know how I am going to feed the kids, or if we'll even have a place to live. My bills are adding up quickly and we have no food. My landlord is very strict and will not bend on my rent because we've only lived here for 90 day. I am but sure what to do. School starts next week and I can't get supplies or outfits. I used my last bit of gas to go to a food pantry only to find out that I make too much money for assistance and I can't get a payday loan because I got one two weeks ago to help fix my now exs car. I hope someone here can help me or direct me somewhere I can get help. Thank you for reading. "
1079	True	a	I've got a movie date tomorrow night (Wednesday 2/1) and he's ordering the movie I want to see via onDemand. I'd like to order us a big ol' pizza to snack on after a long day of class/work/meetings *but* I only have $4 in my account.  **I get paid on Friday and will offer 2 separate pizzas asap to pay it forward!**  I'm in the US and there's a Domino's only a block from his place. Any offers would be immensely appreciated and many good vibes and thanks will be sent!!  [edit] I also have great coupons for my area!! So I'd only need a small donation :)
1080	False	a	Couple days before pay day and totally broke and in want of pizza.  Nothing pressing, but I thought what the hell. ^__^ Many thanks ^__^
1081	False	a	Community college in the summer and full time in the Fall at UH! I'm pretty hungry and to be honest, I'm kinda scared that the remainder of the money in my account won't be enough to get me to work till next paycheck...Pizza would be awesome right now!
1082	False	a	My bad have no money to order even a pizza.
1083	False	a	I am by no means starving, but i'm currently visiting my g/f in Berkeley (im from denver), and before i left, i lost my wallet (credit cards, debit cards, ID's, etc. luckily had my passport to get on the plane). But I ran outta cash and have no means of getting pizza (which happens to be my favorite food), and itd b real nice to get some pizza and not have to bum off her for one night. I will absolutely pay it forward when i get home and get sorted. If your are only able to give once though, plz help out someone more in need, im just a poor college student, but i only gotta take care of my self. Promise to take pics.  Be easy.
1084	False	a	I keep seeing these videos popping up on YouTube. You know the one's with the really depressing music and the guy sitting in a dark room holding up signs. I figured why not try it out and see if someone is generous enough to reward My starving roommates (Brother and his GF) and I with some Pizza. I would put more info about our situation but I will let the depressing video do the talking for me.  [WATCH THE VIDEO](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu57Uvqdh7I)  Copied from YouTube video My Brother his Girlfriend and I just moved from Portland Oregon up to Redmond Washington for a job that we got offered. She currently isn't working and tomorrow is our payday as of right now we have no money or food. I have been eating my Christmas candy but that isn't helping at all, in fact it's making me feel worse. I would LOVE for a Reddit to give us a Pizza. Of course I will help out another down and out Redditor next week when I do have my paycheck.  Thanks IkeLewis
1085	False	a	Hi /Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, I design doom maps in my spare time[reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette)  and I thought it'd be fun (and yummy!) to make a map or two for pizza. So just leave some details on a map you'd like me to make, I usually map in boom format so pretty much any source port should run it. If you have a midi in mind for me to use post it! (No mp3s please. I think boom might run ogg but I'm not sure). Also I'm a bit of a slaughter mapper, so I might go a biiiiit heavy on the mob count. I don't intend on spending more than a week on the map, so nothing too big.   And just to plug my projects a bit:  [newgothic](http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/?id=16238)  [shai'tan's luck](http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/?id=15945)  I've also done a map for Plutonia Revisited and 2 in the 1994 redux project.

1086	False	a	Hi Everyone,  This is my first try at this.  We have a family of seven and are just running a little short this week until payday on Tuesday.  We would really appreciate a pizza or two tonight so that we can get off the Ramen binge this weekend.  If you'd like to help us out, please feel free to ask whatever questions you might have.    Thanks, Jason 
1087	True	a	I'm helping my friend out who got kicked out of his house, letting him crash here and offering my time and whatever else he needs. As a result of helping him drink his way out of this (not healthy, I know, but we all deal in different ways, and he IS looking for a new place) we're broke and I'm out of ideas to cheer him up. Then I saw this place. It would be a perfect story, and cheer him up immensely, if some random stranger on the internet helped us out. 
1088	False	a	Leaving my old stomping grounds of Atlanta to head for greener pastures ( or well , flatter ones i suppose ) . Between the packing and getting a place to live set up im out of readily available cookware and expendable income , was just wanting to try and see if i could get a friendly and memorable send off from a town i love so much. Either or , thanks for the good times atlanta
1089	True	a	Hi, I've ran out of food and I don't have any money to buy food until I get paid tomorrow. Please can a kind redditor order a pizza for me from dominos.co.uk .If you pay by credit/debit card I can walk to dominos 30 minutes away to collect it. ¬£5.99 is the cheapest pizza. If you can only use paypal, you will need to order a more expensive pizza at least ¬£8.99 and they have to deliver it to me. I have ¬£3.20 in my paypal account I can send you. If you are kind enough to buy me one please pm me for my details. I will be forever grateful. I'm from Scotland, UK. The name of the pizza is below.  Tandoori Hot  Tandoori chicken, onions, mushrooms, green peppers, jalapeno peppers. 198kcal / large slice.  Personal (4 slices), ¬£5.99
1090	True	a	Lost my job in August. Was my own damn fault but still have not found anything.. Just feelin a little bummy and need some comfort food.
1091	False	a	I had to move back in with my parents, I share a room with my parents computer and have to wear a bandana as a blindfold so I can sleep since that light just HAS to be on. A full stomach of pizza would make me sleep better.
1092	False	a	It's not about the food. I have dinner already made, so I won't be going hungry. I just think itll be funny watching what my parents do getting free pizza when we already ate dinner. If they'll take it out not, if they'll argue of what. Actually, if someone could get the pizza to arrive at like 9 or 10, it'll probably be even better. It doesn't even need to be pizza, just something, breadsticks maybe. Just something to make my parents wonder why there's summertime at our door at 10 o clock
1093	False	a	Tomorrow I have a pretty stressful day ahead of me. I've got to do tons of calling and mailing and application filling out to do in order to drop one school and enroll in another. I'm pretty terrible at handling stress too so a pizza would be a perfect way to unwind after it all. Any from the big 3 would be fine, but Pizza Hut is my favorite!
1094	True	a	Hey all lost my job a little over 8 months ago, finally got a new one that I start the 4th of next month. My bank account is negative, and the only way I have survived is food stamps, which I get again this Friday. Anyone want to send me a Papa John's pizza (only chain that will deliver here) In STL City, you will help me eat until I get food on Friday!
1095	False	a	hey reddit were just hanging out and broke as fuck and hungie as hell. our dog is sick after eating the roast we've been cooking all tonight. if anyone can help us out it would be greatly appreciated!
1096	False	a	Didn't want to use my normal reddit username, as I have friends and family I'd rather not have see me in such a way, hope that's ok.
1097	False	a	Due to a slight emergency I wasn't able to register classes now, but classes already started and classes are booked. I just want something to make this day go better. 
1098	False	a	Broke college senior trying to get through finals week studying and would love a pizza pick me up. Broke right now and tired of eating ramen and old leftover chinese take out. 
1099	True	a	This past week at work, I fell off an office chair that was missing a bolt and ended up having to get a tetanus shot and 6 x-rays. I'm living from paycheck to paycheck, so I'm eating meagerly as it is, and the lost wages from the work I had to miss mean even less food from this next one, though still enough to get by. Also, I've been in a lot of pain, which has made it a really shitty week. A pizza would do wonders to improve it.  Note: I looked into worker's comp, which doesn't start compensating for lost wages until you've missed three days of work. I wasn't gone for three days because I just got a new second part-time job and didn't want to miss more than a day for fear of losing it.
1100	False	a	My boyfriend is a SUPER pessimist, and I told him about the pizza exchange. He said there was no way anyone on the internet would just give someone else a pizza, so I'm hoping to prove him wrong!
1101	False	a	If possible I'd like papa johns so I can couple it with their current promo of buy a pizza get one free tomorrow. Thanks in advance. :D
1102	False	a	I live in Nanaimo BC Canada. And I am really craving pizza.. I will return the love next friday night (payday)
1103	False	a	It's been a long day of work, fairly stressed out, and I've lost faith in humanity. Can it be restored?
1104	False	a	My best friend, who I haven't seen in THREE MONTHS!!!, came into town last night to celebrate for her 23rd birthday! Being it was my duty to show her a good time last night that she would never remember (until the pics make it Facebook...mission blackout accomplished) it is my duty to pamper her and take care of her today....and she would LOVE some pizza to cure her hangover!!! :-)   Sincerely, Extremely hungover yet amazing best friend ;-)
1105	True	a	This is kind of embarrassing for me... I can pay it forward the weekend of the 29th.
1106	False	a	Stupid cracked monitor.
1107	False	a	I'm super hungry and have no monies at all. A pizza would be greatly appreciated. 
1108	False	a	Hello there, RAOP. Pittsburgh PA here. As the title states, I have been out of work and been living off my food stamps.  I am not doing horrible, I promise you that, but I have the biggest hankering for a pizza.  I assure you, once my bills are in order again, I will pay it forward.  Thank you for your time, and consideration. 
1109	False	a	I'm a host that works a food service job that doesn't offer a discount or allow you to eat in their restaurant. I'm part of the only dept. in the restaurant that doesn't get tips. I just worked OT on my Friday (which I won't see a penny of until payday next week) and I have two packets of ramen to subsist on, currently, with about $1.29 in the bank. I'm hungry. :(  I can provide some modicum of proof if needed, and I will eagerly return the favor someday  if anyone would be willing to help out. Thank you, and my grumbling tummy thanks you.   
1110	True	a	Don't want to get all bluh bluh with my personal situation, but.  tl;dr, got laid off recently and cash is tight like spandex at the gym.  Things lately have kind of felt like this:  http://i.imgur.com/mimsY.gif  I'm in Redmond, just added Seattle since some people aren't familiar with the area.  Pizza Hut or Papa John's preferred.  [edit:] Request closed!   Massive thanks to puppeteer107 for being so generous.
1111	False	a	No sob story here, just a hungry guy after work. I've got a pretty big craving for some pizza but trying to save cash for when I head up to school again in the fall. Any of you guys want to help a dude out?  C:
1112	False	a	Listening to 45:33, hence the title. Anyone feeling particularly generous? I can draw you a picture, or tell you a story, or anything really. I've won a few contests, but never received a pizza. My roommate and I would be super grateful, as we'll be up all night working on our script for a Blaxploitation Zombie Comedy film (sure zombies are played out, but who cares).   Much love to you all and the community.
1113	False	a	Hi everyone...I have a job, and I go to school, but recently, I've found myself broke, with my car in the shop.  My checking account is in the negative and my fridge is pretty bare.  I would love a pizza today.  I figure I can make a few meals from it.  When I get my finances back on track I will pay it forward for someone else.  Thank you in advance and have a great day :)  DM
1114	True	a	"Hello amazing do-gooders of Reddit!  I'm 26, and graduating with my B.S. in 31 days. I busted my ass off to get a special grant from the state this year so that I could afford to finish my final year of my undergraduate degree. Each semester this is $2500, and really it just helps me pay rent and utilities. (My mom passed away a year ago, and my father is currently squatting in house in the Appalachians somewhere. I literally have nowhere to go if I can't afford a place to live.)  Well, I am still waiting on the grant money for this semester. My case worker contacted me 10 days ago saying she had just caught something she missed, and I should expect the school to receive payment in ""a few weeks""... And I'm still waiting.  Thankfully I just got a part time job working 12-10 sat &amp; sun. But my first paycheck is largely going to pay my recently increased Comcast bill and my cellphone, which I haven't had on since March 22. My birthday was on March 27, and I didn't get a single present or phone call because I can't pay my phone bill. I am behind on my rent. I've been surviving off of 1-2 packets of ramen a day for the past 3 weeks.   I could really just use a hug... or an internet hug in the form of a pizza...  And fully plan on pizza-ing someone the second I can afford to. "
1115	False	a	IN A NUTSHELL, MY WIFE was prescribed Vistaril for anxiety attacks. Due to extreme stress she suffered one yesterday and now she is resting. Because of extra hardships this month our fridge and cabinets are getting very empty and I am NOT the whiz in the kitchen that my wife is. I have fed my children peanut butter and jelly for two days and now we are out of bread, I would LOVE to treat them to a few pizzas, yet my wallet cannot afford it at this time... We saw a pizza hut commercial for the big box pizzas and my 6 year old begged me for a pizza. It broke my heart to tell her we didn't have the money for it... when my 4 year old piped up that we can just go to walmart and get some money ha ha! So here is my request, if there is anyone who can get us 2 big box pizzas (one sausage and one cheese) from Pizza hut in Harrison Arkansas.. (phone number is 870-743-3500) I can pickup from there no problem. I will recieve VA education benefits on the 6th and can pay it forward on that day. From the bottom of my heart and from the pit of my childrens stomachs (not having to suffer through my sad attempt at cooking a meal) THANKS to anyone who can help us!
1116	False	a	I packed up my entire apartment today and only have enough money to make it to maryland(I hope) I have less then $100 to my name
1117	False	a	Well, my super awesome wiener dog hurt his back pretty bad a few weeks ago and the vet bills have pretty much wiped me out. I have some ramen laying around but I sure would love an actual meal. I'll gladly pay it forward this friday when I get paid. Thank you so much in advance!
1118	False	a	"Seriously, you'd think a movie about male strippers would tickle this girl's fancy, but no dice.  I should have gone to see ""Ted""...  Also I get paid tomorrow and can pay a pizza forward. =)"
1119	True	a	Hello, I've just really had a bad week.  To sum things up, I found out my wife cheated on me 9 days ago.  I've since moved, but my fridge is empty and I'm basically broke due to the move until the 17th.  If you want more details please just look at my post history, but I'd rather keep all of that out of this thread.       I really just want some warm pizza to eat while I watch a few movies with my dogs.  I know I'm posting this on a throwaway account, but I wanted to explain the situation and can't use my main account to protect my self and my (cheating) wife.     Thanks.
1120	True	a	(*throwaway acct*) I never thought I'd get to this point, I am selling my ps3 on craigslist and I just ran out of cereal (I have been living on dry cereal+water for the past week).  I can't eat until I get paid on the 15th, I just eat popcorn at work to fill my stomach.  It's really sad but you have to do what you have to do.  (I could make a large pizza last a week for sure).  When I get paid I WILL pay it forward, I always keep my promises.  I have a verification code and even a link to my craigslist post (still not answered after having posted it before the 1st of May).  I can take a pic of my ridiculously empty fridge/pantry, bank account is pitiful right now.  Can someone help me? Thanks so much!
1121	False	a	http://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/11jtww/havent_eaten_in_6_days_feeling_dizzy_and_very/  Ignore the last comment, i feel like im dieing lol
1122	True	a	Today is my wife and my anniversary. While we have had a great day together and have enjoyed it, unfortunately there has been a little something missing. We haven't had a chance to treat ourselves today, (or this week, month, year) due to financial reasons. While we do have the 20 bucks for a pizza, it's literally our last and we can't justify spending it regardless of the day. The usual long list of financial, employment and medical hardships have gotten us where we are but that's not what we're here for. We're here to hopefully CELEBRATE our second wedding anniversary with the help from fellow redditors.  Oh ya, and my wife is 7 months pregnant so you know she's ready for a pizza! Pics and evidence [here](http://imgur.com/a/9SQRB) Our local (AND ONLY) pizza place that delivers to us can be found at [this](http://www.foxspizza.com/locations/stores.ep.html?STATE=Virginia&amp;x=10&amp;y=6) link (Ours is the Berryville location) 
1123	False	a	Morale is low at my work establishment. My department consists of 3 people so I'm not asking for more than one pizza, and we are not picky by any means. This would be an amazing moral booster for my team, and something we all will be paying forward in the future. 
1124	False	a	First, this is a throw away account because I don't want my real life friends reading about this.    My family has gotten by in the past few years through me finding odd jobs and my mothers small income from her job.  It's not much but we get by.    The reason I'm requesting tonight is because my mom decided to take what money we had saved up to buy food for us for thanksgiving and for the next week so that she could buy alcohol, cigarettes, and lottery tickets.  I'm not sure why she did this but it leaves us with very little food for the week.  All I'm asking for is a pizza or two that could feed my family and I for the next two days until I get paid on Wed.  Thanks in advance.
1125	False	a	please i need some sort of help from somebody with a kind heart i lost my job a month ago i was struggling as it is i'm late on the rent again and don't know when will i be able to pay it or even if i'm going to be able do it i request for a pizza not for me but for my 3 little brothers that have been eating ramen noodles for 2 weeks now and it would really brighten their day if somebody was kind enough to offer us a pizza i thank you in advance and god bless
1126	False	a	I'm going into a residential rehab tomorrow for 6 months. It's finally time to get my life together once and for all. A pizza from a random redditor would be a great going away gesture. Thanks.
1127	False	a	So, a friend got screwed out of a place tonight (landord dick-ness), and as such is stuck using what little money she has left paying for a hotel in Southwest Florida. If you kind pizza-ers can give her a hand that'd be swell. I know it's not me, but she's never used Reddit, and College has also left me quite poor. You have my word that I will pay it forward. Thanks regardless!
1128	False	a	My lease on my apartment is up tomorrow afternoon and I have nowhere to live aside from my car for the next two weeks. I have no money because my last pay check went into rent and medical bills after having to get my tooth knocked out a few months back, so I've got nothing until next week. Pizza would be great and itll be the last time i get to use my current address lol. Hopefully someone can help me out. 
1129	False	a	Out of the 4 of us only one of us is able to work. I thought it the right thing to do and try to relax with some pizza that won't cut into the bills. Thank you.
1130	False	a	Last week and a half hasn't been to good, car got totaled on Thursday n found out that the driver has no insurance, found out one of my family members has been commiting identity fraud past 5 years. N yesterday lost my wallet and food stamp card. Asking for a little help until Friday, will definitely be appreciated n once things settle down I will definitley give back.
1131	False	a	I love you all
1132	True	a	I see constant whining and sob stories to get a pizza. I don't have one. I can say that I'm asking for some pizza because it sounds good, I haven't had it in a while and would really enjoy it. Thanks for the consideration. Have a great day.
1133	True	a	I have a job interview today, but I won't have any money until Sunday or Monday. Any kind of pizza would be nice, I could definitely make that last me two or three days. I can pm proof of my balance for both cards if needed.
1134	True	a	Have one pack of Ramen in the cupboard with a can of re fried beans. Willing to trade some design work for hot pizza pie, take a look at my work. I will have any work you need done finished by tonight!  I come representing Portland, OR. Thank you RAOP!  [Here's Me!] (http://ryanbowsher.wordpress.com)
1135	False	a	I'm 21, live in North Carolina, and currently my checking account has $16.61 in it.  I'm a college student at UNC, and I quit my job in February to try and start a business (I'm a business major). Things are moving much slower than I expected, but nobody said it would be easy. I think I have a chance to make some money this coming week, but until then this is what I'm stuck with.  I've never been in this place before, I've always had some kind of job since I started working in high school, so I've always had some backup cash. Well once school runs out and the loans are dry here I am, pretty fucked. Dad's helping with rent and bills each month, but I'm ashamed as it is to take money from him, I can't possibly ask for more until he offers it, especially since he tells me they've cut his pay at his current position.  My roommate has been out of town too, and she owes me $50 for her half of the electric, but won't be back in town until Tuesday. Meanwhile, I sit here in the apartment working, trying not to leave lest I spend money or gas, with a near empty kitchen. And I've just run out of bud too. . .  I really enjoy just plain cheese pizza, or maybe cheese and bacon or something simple. It's the simple, little things in life anyway.
1136	False	a	Starving, upset with USPS for slacking on check delivery, car-less and it's raining (not meatballs). Will buy whoever gets me a pizza next week. 
1137	False	a	My Girlfriend's friends are jerks, and I would like to get her a pizza, but I am a broke-ass scrub... or something else funny. Don't tell her. It's a surprise.
1138	False	a	Hey everyone, I'm about 2 months pregnant and im starving tonight. I dont get paid until the 1st in a couple days but I have zero food for tonight, not even some ramen noodles or bread. I'm literally out of everything. I was gonna go to a local church tomorrow to see if they could give me a couple of days worth of food but for tonight I have nothing to eat. If anyone could help me out with 1 hot pizza for tonight I'd be so happy, ty so much! 
1139	False	a	Good evening Redditors! My friend Francois and I are hanging out this evening and we just decided to try reddit. We were looking around and found RAOP and we thought what a good night it would be if our first reddit experience was joined by pizza! So we are asking for a kind soul to hook us up! We are also willing to do something for you, udk what but we could make you a funny video or send you pics of our cute dogs and cat, or I manage a band, we could give you a shoutout on our FB page! Thank you very much!
1140	False	a	My boyfriend and I are both college students who survive on financial aid. We have very little money to spend, and don't have the ability to eat out often. Though we are not in desperate need, a pizza would be a wonderful gift to brighten our spirits (and a nice change from pre-packaged food). It's hard to have your nose on the grindstone all of the time and not be able to go out for food or fun, but if there are people who need it more, please, help them!
1141	False	a	Could use a pepperroni and mushroom visitor.
1142	False	a	I'm a hungry and broke college student at FIU in Miami and desperately in need of some food.
1143	False	a	I just got back from a vacation with my dad, and I get home to my mom's, and it turns out she's gone vegan. A nice pepperoni pizza would make not only my day, but my week, or even quite possibly my month. All the thanks in the world if you decide to help out. :) 
1144	False	a	Anyone generous enough? :)
1145	False	a	I'm in Cincinnati and my automatic bill pay screwed me over for the rest of the week.  It's really my fault, but I just ran out of cheeze-its.  I have 4 Dota 2 keys if anyone still actually needs them.
1146	True	a	I'd appreciate it so much if someone would help tide me over. I don't really have a sob story, it's my fault for not budgeting better but times are tough... been so busy studying and working part time. Hopefully I can  pay it forward.
1147	False	a	Basically the copays from seeing multiple doctors (general physician and then a orthopedic) drained my bank account and I dont have any food in the house. I would greatly appreciate a helping hand.
1148	False	a	Please and thank you!
1149	False	a	My Dad and stepmom are having their 5 year anniversary tonight! They're heading into boston and i would love pizza for the rest of the family (Tim, Kraig, Carl, Randy and Kev + Me) But i am all out of money until Thursday! Will pay it forward!
1150	False	a	We've been getting food from the local pantry (a little less than 1 bag of groceries a week) and aren't starving, but having to serve  pasta again is taking an emotional toll.   Thanks for considering us... Lee
1151	False	a	the aroma fills the air  as i wait patiently to eat  pepperoni, cheese, and sausage  all are such a delicious treat  
1152	True	a	Me and my housemate really want some pizza lovin'. But we're both low on funds, I lost my job last week, so she's been supporting me... I'm in Australia (Whittlesea area, VIC), 2 nearby pizza's places, the cheaper option is any Large pizza for 10 dollars... She will pose in any position (SFW) asked to the successful bidder with pizza and personalised love note... Other requests negotiable, no nudes etc  She does contracted modelling from time to time... I'm no photographer, but i'll try my best... Here's a sneak  http://i.imgur.com/1En8M.jpg http://i.imgur.com/DX0IE.jpg  And from today http://i.imgur.com/k73jw.jpg
1153	True	a	This hurts my pride to beg like this, but the position I am in leaves me with few options and hungry. I have my daughter with me and I'm flat broke with not much food in the house besides a couple cans of black beans and peanut butter; nothing I'd constitute as a meal. To anyone that is feeling generous enough to send a pizza my way it would be appreciated beyond words. I thought this would be worth a shot. 
1154	False	a	We have Dominos, Papa Johns (my favorite) and one or two Pizza Huts over here in Caracas.  
1155	False	a	I am an older college student that is broke for another week.  I do have food options in my fridge but it has been forever since I had a delivery pizza.  I am not picky about the chain or toppings (except anchovies, yuck).  I would love just a multi-topping pizza of any size or crust and possibly soda to go with.
1156	True	a	Not sure why it's Pizza Hut in particular, but this craving has been driving me insane for the past two weeks.  And unfortunately I got into a small accident last weekend, so any money I come across has to go toward repairing my car.  If some kind soul could bless me with a large pizza or send me a Pizza Hut gift card I will return the favor as soon as I can, either to the donator or to someone else in need (their choice).  I'm having bloodwork done tomorrow in the same town with the Pizza Hut, so I can pick it up then!  That would make my week.  Possibly my month, since the whole car thing was quite shitty.  Edit: Crap I forgot to mention in the title, I'm in New Hampshire!  **UPDATE:** I was able to use afshin's gift card and had enough to get both a large stuffed crust pizza AND cinnamon sticks!  Here I am post pizza pick-up.  http://i.imgur.com/pyUuc.png  I couldn't wait and started eating in the parking lot haha.  Once LHtheXF's gift card shows up I will donate it to another redditor. :)  Thanks again you guys are amazing!
1157	False	a	I'm so hungry, I boiled up 2 potatos this morning but that was the last food in the house. Definitely intend on paying the favor forward when I get my check next wednesday.
1158	False	a	"References: Robot_Legs, ""Hungry, Hungry Roommates"", (December, 2012)"
1159	False	a	Going to the University of Oregon in Eugene and would appreciate some meaty, cheesy, gooey goodness to help me hit the books. Please PM me for the verification code. Thank you.
1160	False	a	My husband and I are down on our luck and have recently maxed out our CC's buying food, he's unemployed and myself a mother to be, times are rough, but we know they will get better. He's to humble to ever ask so i've snuck off to ask this in the other room  Thanks for any help RAOP  -A hungry family to be  
1161	True	a	Hey RAoP, first time post, I'm feeling desperate.  Money is really tight with me these past few months because I just moved to a new apartment just south of Bellevue. Which has managed to milk me dry with its first months rent and deposit, came out to about 1100 bucks.  (barely make 1k a month) I am, as a result, flat broke, and also haven't been able to eat for about 36 hours. My next paycheck also wont be here until next wednesday Dec, 6. If any good people are willing to spring for a pizza which would last me a few days, I would be entirely grateful!
1162	False	a	when we found out our roomate wasnt paying the bills we gave her money for, we asked her to leave, she stole every dime we had. sold stuff and bills are all paid, but its ramen for a cpl weeks. coud really use a reminder there are good helpfull people in the world
1163	False	a	I had to take the week off in order to move in, so I didn't bring home any tips which would normally get me through. If I could get a pizza to hold me over the next evening and lunch/dinner tomorrow, I could make it last until Saturday and have enough money to pay it forward on demand.  If anyone could help me out, I would be so incredibly grateful and if there is any way I could help you out even besides a random act of pizza, I'll do what I can to the best of my ability (provided it is completely reasonable; I'm sure I can take out an entire high rise of elite bodyguards guarding your kidnapped grandmother, but I don't really have the time for it in my schedule).
1164	False	a	I'm a little short on cash this week, or I'd buy it myself.
1165	False	a	I had a threatened miscarriage last night and I'm stuck resting up until I see my OB tomorrow when the office opens.  I need to go grocery shopping, but really can't yet. And with baby coming I can't justify spending money on a pizza.  I do have a verification code.  Thanks, Reddit. &lt;3
1166	False	a	Just looking for something to help out the parents, everyone's been stressed and there's not much money to go around for food at the moment. I will be able to pay it back in full on Tuesday with a little extra if needed/wanted.  EDIT: If anything does come through before these places close I'd be using http://www.just-eat.co.uk/ if it's of any relevance.   EDIT 2: Thanks for the upvotes guys but unfortunately it's time for me to sleep soon and it's getting closer to closing hours for places near me. Thanks and maybe I'll have better luck in another time of pizza need. :)
1167	False	a	Would very much appreciate a Pizza for Dexter night tonight! My friends and I usually have munchies, this time we are watching it at my house. Because I am trying to lose weight (20 pounds down!) I spent all of my food-money on healthy shit nobody will want. I would be more than happy to return the favour tomorrow or Tuesday.  Thanks for reading! On a side note: who's excited for Dexter?!
1168	False	a	Basically I ran out of money in my school checking account and my personal checking account my debit card has expired so as of Tuesday im waiting 10-14 business days for a new one. Only have like 3 cans of tuna, couple packs of ramen and like a decent amount of pb&amp;j but like 2 slices of bread left and some kraft singles. Should be enough to keep me fed until I can access my funds but a pizza this weekend would really let ration what I have left in case I have to wait a full 14 days. Tallahassee Florida, FSU student. Parents will not help (as usual) they said if I need money ill have to wait 3 weeks. You don't understand how much I would appreciate this.
1169	True	a	Hey RAOP!  As a freelance writer and graphic designer, I'm always short on dough (both kinds...) I figured, why not have an exchange! I'll retouch 5 photos in photoshop in exchange for some cheesy goodness!   You'll get the finished JPG (and the PSD file on request!)  I live in Burbank, CA.  :)
1170	False	a	Happy to pay it forward on friday :) Columbus, ohio here.
1171	True	a	its just me and my 9 year old daughter tonight.we plan on watching christmas movies.she got real good grades on her report card and would like to suprise her with a pizza.thanks
1172	False	a	I don't have a sob story. I'm hungry as hell and would really love the taste of pizza. I WILL pay it forward, post a picture, verify my email. what ever you would like to do. Please and thank you!
1173	False	a	Hello, I am a college student studying electricity. I am 26, and recently quit my job to continue my education. I am a veteran and recieve the GI Bill, which is great, but I have stretched it a bit too far this month with the housing stipend. So, for the past few days I have been eating noodles and bread and A1 sauce. Any offers for pizza will not be unappreciated, though, I only request one. The 1st of July I hope to get a direct deposit. Please PM me for details, and I apologize for the novelty account. I have comments that I have made in the past that I would rather not be public domain.
1174	False	a	I'm just a poor boy attending college and no luck finding a job at the moment.  Something other than ramen noodles would be much appreciated.
1175	False	a	Hey guys! I am located in Dublin, Ireland and am so hungry! I haven't eaten anything for about 10 days because I am on exchange for school and have run out of money! Can't eat again until Dec. 16th when my mom gets paid and can send me some money! Would absolutely pay it forward once I have the funds to do so :) 
1176	False	a	   I have been dieting in order to test for a gluten intolerance, but it looks like wheat and barley doesn't phase me after all.  Recent studies have shown that cats can see blue and green. There is disagreement as to whether they can see red.
1177	True	a	My Mom just returned from trying to buy groceries and believes she was robbed while she turned her back from her cart. About $200 was taken from her wallet and so now we're out that money and groceries from tonight. Salt on the wound is that, upon reflection, she realized a man had been shadowing her almost the whole time in an almost empty store and the store doesn't have video cameras.  My husband and I are down visiting, so it's 5 adults total. If you could spare enough for about 2 pizzas, you'd be doing us a great favor.
1178	False	a	Well, I've been a longtime lurker on this website but I rarely use this account.  After surfing the website for a few minutes I came across this subreddit so now I'm a little curious.  Anyways, I'm not here to conjure up a sob story.  My summer has been pretty busy, between working at an unpaid internship since the beginning of summer and taking an online class to graduate a semester early.  I've been applying for part time jobs since May to earn money and I recently got hired at a restaurant.  Things are looking up, but last night I only got 2-3 hours of sleep and I've never felt this exhausted before.  After seeing this subreddit, I'm craving pizza right now more than anything else.  I hope to return the favor and pay it forward!
1179	True	a	I am just now finding this subreddit and boy did it come at the perfect time. At the beginning of the month, my father passed away, leaving my husband and I to beg off family to pay for the plane ticket to Texas. Worth it to say goodbye to my daddy, but still horrible. When we got back my husband discovered he was not being hired as a teacher at the school he worked at for the following year because he wasn't catholic enough (yes, it was a Catholic school board). This after two years of working for this board, being an active member of the school community, and being loved by all of the students and their parents. He was devastated. Right now he is sitting at the kitchen table filling out application after application... We have $20 inour bank account and his last paycheck, coming in two weeks has to be spent for our big move to Toronto in a month. I am unemployed (I'm immigrating to Canada and they haven't issued a work visa yet) and just want to see my husband have something super neat and nice happen. Earlier he came into the room and said he wished we could order a pizza... Half an hour later I found this!  I'm willing to provide any proof you ask for and as soon as we are on our feet again I wOuld love to return the favor! Is there anyone willing to give a random act of pizza to a couple looking to smile at least once this month?!  UPDATE: Dinner box arrived! Here are some pictures of my husband and I with our amazing treat from Belgar! My husband was so freakin' surprised! It was awesome! So thank you for totally making out evening!! Also, sorry if I'm doing this wrong!!  http://imgur.com/9BPcd  Seriously, best meal I've had in awhile! :D http://i.imgur.com/VVWEJ.jpg
1180	False	a	tl;dr: I'm broke and hungry  nom nom nom plz
1181	False	a	This is my first post ever, I'm not totally sure how this site works. Anyways, I found this subreddit and thought you guys might be able to help us. My fiance and I... well, we're poor. We live in my mom's (finished) basement. He hasn't had work in 3 weeks and had to give his truck away. We also have a sweet 8 month old baby boy, who makes me smile every day. I am breastfeeding, though, and I worry I'm not getting enough calories.   We are in Michigan.
1182	False	a	If someone wouldn't mind helping us out, we would be very grateful. If not, we understand. Thanks.
1183	False	a	Just got out of the hospital after a really bad downhill biking crash. Didnt have a chance to go grocery shopping before the crash and now not able to sit to drive to grocery store. Would very much like a pizza so don't have to starve tonight. Will return the favour after pay day at the end of month. Located in Kelowna BC canada
1184	False	a	I got off work an hour ago and all I've had since Thursday is pasta. That ten is for gas. Would really love some cheesy deliciousness.
1185	False	a	Single mom of 4 and one on the way. Money is running out and my kids deserve a treat (pizza) after all they have been through and then some! THANK YOU! :-)
1186	False	a	Need some delicious pizza to go with the massive amounts of alcohol I'll definitely be drinking.
1187	True	a	Hi Everyone!  First time requester here and thanks for reading. I'd like to request a pizza for my partner of 7 years. I think it'd be a really nice surprise for him and he loves Reddit as much as I do, so it'd give him one heck of a smile. If you're interested, I want to provide some history so you know where I'm coming from and why I'd like to see that smile. I'll try to provide enough context without being too verbose :)  About 3 years ago I lost my job in marketing. I was the breadwinner in the relationship and he worked for fun, really. I set out to find another job at the start of the recession and it didn't go so well.  After about a year of being unemployed, living off savings and looking for another job that would pay enough for me to pay my bills (a big concern that stopped me from taking a lot of jobs due to pay requirements... we all have to service our debt obligations!)  I realized I hated what I was doing. I was 25 then... 2 years ago.   It's strange and hard to describe, I think, unless you've gone through something similar. I worked hard, ever since I was 13 and had a paper route that earned me a couple hundred a month. When I was 16 I got a job at Best Buy and that's when my 'career' in sales took off. I sold on the Best Buy floor for about a year, then went to CompUSA where I worked as a commissioned sales guy. My first commission job and I was only 17. I made really good money and continued to progress through retail and then into retail marketing.   By the time I was entering college I was making more than most people who had been out of college for years, and that number went up every year. That kind of money blinded me to the fact that I wasn't enjoying what I was doing... I was enjoying making and spending money. So much so that I burned through it faster than I made it. It was really the only thing I had fun doing, though. I dropped out of college (probably a good thing, since I was going for a degree I wouldn't want now).  I met my partner through Myspace at about the time I had gotten my first management position and was traveling 90% of the time. The first couple years were great. I was gone so much it was like a long honeymoon. Sometimes he'd come with me; Vegas, NYC, Seattle... etc.   For his part he worked off and on. It was never a big deal... I made a lot more money than him. He'd always worked odd retail jobs, hourly stuff, customer service stuff. Never made over $10 an hour or held a job for more than half a year. I didn't care because I'd rather spend my time with him when I was home than have him working and making a couple extra bucks.  So, back to three years ago when I lost my job. After about a year of coming up dry, I fell into a pretty bad depression. I couldn't find work that would pay my bills, and realized that I didn't even like doing that work. It affected our relationship dramatically. I retreated into World of Warcraft and stopped talking to family. Eventually the money ran out and bills stopped getting paid.   I hit bottom after a long, dark period... but thankfully for me bottom was a nice soft pillow of people that loved me. My parents stepped in to help get me through some tough financials and my partner stepped up to support me mentally and financially.   Fast forward to today. My partner is now happily employed (1 year anniversary this month) with a company that is providing him with a promising career opportunity that he loves doing. We've downsized our lives; no car, eating cheap, staying in, cooking and we've moved into a studio apartment. My partner is working we're saving so I can go to school and do something that I do love; be a vet. He even got me a chocolate Labrador puppy in February. We named him Fizban and he's a constant source of joy for me. The person I was 3 years ago would not recognize the person I am today.  I try to do nice things for him whenever possible to lessen the stress of being the sole earner in the house. That's what this request is about. We're not starving, but we live tight. This would not only be a delicious treat for us, but once my partner found out that it came from a generous person on Reddit he will be amazed.  One day I promise to pay it forward. Here's a picture of my dog, Fizban and my partner:  http://imgur.com/SoygY
1188	False	a	Hi, i moved out 2 weeks ago and just started a new job so i have no money at all. i haven't been able to buy groceries in a week and ran out of food 3 days ago. im just lookin for something small but that i can eat for the next week until my first paycheck. any help would be very appreciated.
1189	False	a	Recently moved to Montreal, start a new job Monday but until then I am absolutely broke.  Pizza would save my life.
1190	False	a	Been working all week last week and I don't get paid for it soon enough. during that week I stayed at a friend's empty eating nothing but rice with soy sauce since I was only paid 20 dollars for the week. The week before that wasn't swell either.  If anyone would help it'd be greatly appreciated, as I haven't had much of anything this week and I'm dying to get paid..
1191	False	a	Worst week of our lives. My husband and I have been struggling to make bills and feed ourselves for the few past months. This week in particular has gone extremely down hill. We've been sick, without air conditioning in 90 degree weather, power would have been shut off if it weren't for my mother and every little thing in between. Today is our two year anniversary, and we are out of food and money until tomorrow. It would be nice to have some pizza for dinner if someone could help out.  Also, we have no internet, so I'm using my phone. Sorry if I'm slow to respond. :/   Thank you in advance if anyone responds. We aren't the type of people who like asking for help, it just seemed like a special occasion.
1192	False	a	I dont get paid till tommorow and have nothing to eat after I get off work. I promise to pizza it back when I get paid. Thanks in advance!
1193	True	a	My boss was supposed to pay me on Friday, asked if I could wait until Saturday. Haven't seen him all weekend, and this has seriously demonified my situation. Could use a 'za for the night. Will pay it forward next week!  Despite the remote location, we have Domino's, Pizza Hut and Boston Pizza. Order take out - I'm nearby all of them and I can save you delivery.  Thanks!
1194	True	a	Hi RAOP, there are some great offers up right now but most don't seem to be drawing for a few days. That's nice but by tomorrow morning I'll actually be able to grab some bare essentials like milk, eggs, bread, and cereal. I was just wondering if somebody could help me out because my only option here is to heat a can of tomato puree.   EDIT: I'm in the northern suburbs of Chicago.
1195	False	a	Hey everyone, I'm a college student who lives west of Pittsburgh, PA. It's been one of those weeks. I'm sure you have been there before. Today I had to make the unfortunate decision between paying bills and eating. Unfortunately, the bills prevailed. My anxiety shot through the roof today, and I had to leave class early because I was having a panic attack. I figure I could use a hug right now, but a pizza will more than suffice. I'm not expecting much of anything, even some words of kindness and encouragement would be much appreciated. There is some good news to all of this: I recently got hired full time as a programming analyst. Unfortunately I don't start until early next year, so I am stuck in this situation for a while. I will be more than glad to return the favor some day to anyone who decides to help.  Thanks!  edit:  I am actually a real person! [Look!](http://s0.i1.picplzthumbs.com/upload/img/98/c9/82/98c9826b27d5b5e8a2a8fb5b36a121755dbde805_wmeg_00001.jpg)
1196	False	a	I've been trying to convince her of the greatness of reddit and redditors for a while and I think free pizza on her birthday would convince her.
1197	False	a	(I will write you a poem/haiku about whatever you want for a pizza.)  I got up hungry     Because my roommate is cheap     Pasta is not good      My roommate and I take turns doing the grocery shopping, and this past week he ended up going. He brought back two cases of ramen, a 12 pack, and smokes. The 12 pack he downed himself the first night, his cigs are gone, and we are left with these little nasty packages of ramen. Sad part is, the receipt didn't add up to what I originally gave him. Can someone out there help two friends out with a meal that isn't soggy noodles? If you help us, your haiku will be posted for all to see. We will also supply [pictures](http://i.imgur.com/b0VNB.jpg), as that's just how we roll =)  
1198	False	a	I have my reddit account for a while, I have participated in RedditGifts and even bought a redditor pizza once  just short on cash and really have a craving for pizza.  I would gladly buy you pizza when i get paid.   EDIT: I GOT SOME PIZZA!!! A Friend of mine who also reddits noticed my post and sent domino's over.  Thank you for all the offers. You are all really awesome!  if anyone needs some pizza next week when i get paid, feel free to PM me.  
1199	True	a	Ive been unemployed for over a month, and have actively been looking for a new job to no avail, and well, as such I dont have food (no really I dont mean all I have is Ramen kind of no food, because well, even Ramen costs too much) and me and my roommate are starved as our other three roommates try to preach live together die alone and then only take care of themselves. So Im here today Random Acts of Pizza to ask for some help, Id literally sell my soul for some coffee and pizza. I understand if theres someone who would need it more for instance people with children, in fact  I ask you pizza them first, but I would greatly appreciate a Pie &lt;3

They both work minimum wage jobs, go to school and pay their own rent in NYC...just like a ton of other college kids out there. I just wanted to send some pizza love their way so they won't have to spend any more money than they already do.... Thanks all!
1202	False	a	My brother need's some pizza for his First year of college. First post.  He needs Some food for the next couple of days. I'm new to this so if i make a mistake Don't yell at me  He lives in Las Vegas NV
1203	False	a	We haven't had food fo the weekend because of our school's awkward food service schedule. We're trying to celebrate the Earth Hour tonight at 8:30 - 9:30pm central time. Just trying to eat beforehand.
1204	True	a	Hi guys!  Me and my girlfriend came to the US yesterday. It is so cool here! :) We start working on Wednesday and are kinda strapped for money until then. We are anxious to try anything that is American, and pizza is definitely something related to USA.  We're not too picky, we'd like to try something classic. It is not us to decide what is classic to you, so let it be your pick :)  We live in Kill Devil Hills, NC. There are some places which deliver, but we don't really know them anyways, so again it would be your pick :)  Thanks!
1205	True	a	Zalodad and myself would love to have a pizza with our kids tonight! My husband lost his job, our food stamps haven't come in yet and I don't get paid till next week. Plus we have only a couple of dollars for gas and hardly anything in the pantry. If you could help, we would appreciate it! :) 
1206	False	a	"Facing financial issues and been scraping along for food haha. Pizza sounds awesome right about now. I'm airborne infantry with the 82nd. My hobby is art. So if you want a ""screen saver"" I'm your man hahahaha. The pizza places here in Fayetteville are open 24 hrs and accept credit over the phone ^^ feeeeeed me nom nom nom"
1207	False	a	Me and my fiancee have been spending a lot recently combining Arbitrary day, cleaning supplies, steam sale, and just being really busy as of late.. so if someone could toss a pizza our way it would be much appreciated.  As compensation, you can appear as a background character in my webcomic [Antihero for Hire](http://antihero.keenspot.com), possibly running away from some sort of monster or other.  And we'll be sure to pay it forward when we get paid next!
1208	True	a	HI I am in louisville ky and my daughter will be home soon from school and she has been wanting pizza and right now I am broke until I get paid  next week..can anyone please send us some pizza please ..
1209	True	a	My father used to order my mother a pepperoni pizza and an order of breadsticks for the two of them to share (My younger brother and I would have our own). He included a special request to have the pepperonis arranged in a smile and would personally place 2 breadsticks on the pizza to give it a mustache.   This always put a smile on her face. My younger brother has autism and my mother has Multiple Sclerosis but has still been working her ass of through the pain.  She lost her job at the end of last August and a month later my father passed away. I just got off the phone with her and she was holding back tears. I really want to make her smile by bringing back some of the good memories of my father and reminding her that there is good in the world.  I do not have a credit card and only have $4 in my bank. I would really like to send her a smiley-face pizza. Can anyone help me put a smile on the most wonderful woman in the world's face?  I promise to pay it forward as soon as I have the funds.  **Edit** USA - AL
1210	False	a	I don't like asking others for help, but it's been 2 days and I'm so very hungry. I had no choice but to ask.  I would really appreciate anything anyone can do to help, and I will happily pay it forward once I get paid in the next couple of days. I will also make sure to post a big, fat Thank You post to whomever does me this great kindness.  Thanks!  EDIT: roommate came through! No longer needed. Thx!
1211	False	a	I'm not new to Reddit and I'm not from Jacksonville either. Sorry but I'm requesting incognito because I don't want anyone I know to find out about what's happening right now. There's a really messed up situation and I haven't even told my dad about this yet, so I don't want my friends or cousins finding out yet either because they can't keep their mouths shut.  I got a surprise yesterday when a guy I've never even met greets me in the hallway of my apartment building and tells me he wants me to leave my girlfriend of 2 years. My girlfriend then confronts us both and gives me the shock of my life, she's been cheating on me with this guy, and she's pregnant, but she's 90% certain neither of us is the father! She was cheating on me with this guy, and cheating on him with someone else. I've never raised a hand to a girl and never will, I was raised better than that, but I've never been more tempted in my life to haul back and deck someone!  After a two hour conversation with this dude I find out she hasn't been working for a whole year. He's been paying our electric and water since we moved into the apartment! She goes over to his house almost daily when she left me to head to work. Some days she leaves and neither of us could account for where she was. My girlfriend of 2 years is a lady of the night and has been milking 3 guys, me included and maybe more than just us, for everything we've got for years!  I'm at my bros house and he's been very tolerant of all this, real step up kind of guy to take me in because I've been living with this tramp for over a year now, I got no place else to go right now. I need something to eat because neither of us has any money and he's living off noodles right now. I'll happily pay it forward on the 8th when I get paid. But for today, I need something better than noodles or black beans and rice, and I think he would appreciate it too.  Sorry again for being a bit deceptive with my post. If I wasn't starving I wouldn't be spreading it around for that matter either. If anyone can help you have my gratitude.   8:30 AM. Taking a trip out and about, will be back in a few hours to check the thread.  Edit: 5.15 PM-- The generous contribution of another redditor who chooses to remain anonymous (like a boss) has secured dinner for me on this fine evening. I thank the dozens of folks who offered encouragement in thread and through PM as well as the others who flamed and trolled me so diligently. Ripping into you was an awesome way to blow off some steam, so you helped out a lot too. Thanks again to everyone, here's to a brighter future.
1212	False	a	Walked around town about 4 times, did some squats and pushups. No money until next week for groceries. We have food but only bread and whatnot. A Pizza or 2 would make me and my family too happy! :D  zacknormandin@gmail.com
1213	False	a	Hello RAP, I am a student at UNT in Denton, TX and I would like some pizza please.
1214	False	a	Things have been hard. My wife and I worked for the same company and both got laid off about a month ago. Our unemployment still hasn't been approved and today we had to pawn our TV, game system and guitars so that we could pay bills. After putting gas in the car we don't even have enough left for some food. A pizza or two would help lift our spirits.
1215	False	a	It would be super dope!! And I am sure my roommates would appreciate as well.
1216	False	a	I'm 18, just started a boring job full time. Money is not bad. But dirt broke being 18 with a car payment, insurance, rent, a girlfriend. and school. ugh haha. no worries tho, hope everyone enjoys their pizza!
1217	False	a	I found out a couple weeks ago that I have Rheumatoid Arthritis. While I wait to start serious treatment, I'm having to give up just about every focal activity in my life- basketball, yoga, alcohol and long nights out. This is making my move to a new city all the more difficult, as you might imagine. Anyway, I'm hungry, low on food, and too achy to shop and prepare a meal (no real grip function today). I figured it would be worth a shot since I'm just a couple days away from returning the gesture.
1218	False	a	We hold Starcraft King of the Hill tournaments and select a winner. Let me know if you want to help us out by blessing him with a random act of pizza. We had over 122 tickets in the raffle:  http://i.imgur.com/Ip4w8.png &lt;-- Different social networks that played entered  Here is a VOD of the event that happened a few hours ago cued to the time when we picked the winner:  http://www.twitch.tv/rcraftgaming/b/313640366?t=3h58m4s  We love the idea of reddit helping reddit, but I understand if you guys may not approve and please let me know what you think of the concept. Our raffle and tournament are reddit organized from /r/starcraft via the rCraftGaming people.  Thanks you!
1219	False	a	I don't normally do this but my husband and I are in a bit of a financial pickle. I currently do not have a job, but I am looking. We're struggling  quite a bit, at the moment we genuinely only have $19.00 in our checking and $0.75 in our savings. We have to make that last for the next week until he gets paid. I haven't told him that I made this request, I think that it would really cheer him up if a kind person randomly pizzaed us. 
1220	False	a	Hi everyone! I'm in the Nursing Program at a state college in Indiana, and I have practicals and a final for one of my Nursing classes tomorrow...As you can imagine my stress, a pizza that anyone could give me, I would greatly appreciate! Thank you! :)
1221	False	a	I'm hungry and I'm really not feeling the whole cooking thing while trying to wrestle two kids. My husband is unemployed right now, but as soon as he starts working, I'll pay the pizza forward!
1222	False	a	Hello fellow Redditors! I am a cheerleader at my university and I moved on campus a week early for practices. I brought very little food and the cafeteria is not open yet. I would really appreciate it if a Redditor would be so kind as to treat me to a pizza. 
1223	False	a	We've been working all afternoon and we're both very hungry. We would really appreciate the kindness of a stranger!
1224	False	a	Hey guys. I wanted to see how this works out. I just paid off my tuition for this college semester, so I definitely don't have the money for a pizza. :(  Anyone willing to help me out? :3  Gah, forgot location: Ellicott City, Maryland, USA, Earth, This Solar System, This Galaxy, This Universe.
1225	True	a	I'll be hosting a Stargate Marathon this Tuesday, and I've already invested over 70 bucks in it, so if anyone could contribute a pizza, it'd help out a lot.  Do note that I'm not starving or anything, I could simply use a hand in organizing this thing, specially since Pizza is the stereotypical Media Marathon food. Please do help others in dire need before sending me a pie.
1226	True	a	My parents are on vacation and my sister left for the day, but forgot to leave some money for me to order a pizza or something like that. I'm too young to drive, (Maryland driving laws are blah) I was able to get enough change in quarters to make some sort of tip, but no where near enough to pay for a pizza. I have no cooking ability whatsoever, and a pizza sounds amazing.  However, although I don't have a credit card, I do have a saved one on steam, so I will trade any steam game(s) from $1-$15 (with some flexibility) 
1227	False	a	My roommate and I are both college graduates who have not managed to find employment yet, just looking for a good pizza! Will post pic with thanks, and pay it forward!
1228	False	a	Please and thank you. :)
1229	False	a	So I got laid off from my job 2 weeks ago and thought I would find something by now. I've had some interviews, but still waiting to hear from some places i've had very good interviews with. I'm totally broke. I think I might just have exactly $15 in my bank account. I'm hungry and ramen is killing me now. What money I had went to my cat's fancy food (One has a urinary problem thus both have to eat the same food because the one is a food lurker)  If anyone could help supply me with a couple days worth of any awesome pizza, me love you long time
1230	True	a	"I was trying to come up with a drinking game with the little bit of whiskey I have left for this Oscar night.  I suddenly thought, ""Self, a glorious cheese pizza would be a wonderful pairing with impending drunkenness.""  Sadly, I have no pizza but I have such an intense craving now.  Hence the [pic](http://i.imgur.com/4p3aA.jpg).   So please RAOPers, may I have a pie?  I would greatly appreciate (unf) a pie gifted this way."
1231	False	a	My life has gotten pretty crazy over the past 2 weeks. Two of my good friends are sleeping in my living room (one just got divorced and moved back here from another state, he does some under the table work but is running low on cash. The other has just had some bad luck in life and has had a few offers that look promising, so I'm letting him stay until one goes through.) My boyfriend just started working again after being out of work for a few months, but he doesn't get paid until tomorrow. Rent was due this week and all that's left in my cupboard is cheap canned soup. Pizza would really help the morale around here, and I'll pay it forward at the end if the month (I've got 2 weeks of over time coming up.)
1232	False	a	We don't have anything goin on tonight, but we DO have a lot of time to kill and some hungry tummy's!
1233	False	a	Im out of options and really could use the help.. im broke until friday and will repay/pay it forward. I haven't been this desperate before.
1234	True	a	I could go on about how I'm a poor student. But really I'm just in the mood for some pizza after a hard days work.  That is what this subreddit is about, right?  :) 
1235	False	a	corinth, tx  in between classes. hard to study with a stomach like tis. willing to pay it foreward friday when i get my college disbursement.
1236	True	a	I'm broke, unemployed, and my self-esteem is in the gutter. I could have it a lot worse -- I have a roof over my head, and I'm currently in school, finishing the prerequisites for a program I've dreamed of attending for years -- but to be honest, I'm pretty isolated right now, feel lonely, and pizza would make me feel better. Screenshot of my bank account balance and/or other verification available upon request. I hope to get a callback soon from one of the jobs I've applied for, so I can return the favor or pay it forward.
1237	False	a	Hello Reddit. I am very afraid of you. o Ao  I am a 23 year old from Marietta, GA. I lost my job on my birthday back in May and haven't been able to find anything since. I've been doing art commissions since then to try and boost my morale and keep my chin up, but they've slowed a bit and I just paid a student loan payment. With next to nothing in my fridge, $34 in my bank account and a phone bill coming up, I'm broke and hungry.  I'm also really scared of rejection! o Ao   Also, if you're interested in anime-style art commissions or anything of the like, please let me know and I'll get you a link to my deviantART page. After all, that will help me out just as much as a pizza!  Thank you for looking!
1238	False	a	20 years old and I've been unemployed since I finished a 6 month contract in March, and I'm living in my parents' loft. I buy all my own food and pay the very little rent that I can out of my Jobseekers' Allowance, and afterwards have maybe ¬£10-20 a week to do what I like with (including putting money towards my damned ¬£35/month phone bill that I'm locked into 'til August). But hey, it's had an accidental benefit of forcing me to cut down on smoking, 'cos that's just too damn expensive.  I had an interview and a whole bunch of assessments for a great job last week and absolutely aced it. I personally thought I had the job in the bag, and at the very end of the interview I asked when I'd be hearing from them - they told me I'd know today, and then said they've got a few more interviews to do first for *in-house applicants*. Gulped, but whatever. Got to today, and I've sat there next to my phone and checking my emails feverishly. It's now 9PM and I've had no call. So here's to more unemployment.  And frankly, I'm getting sick of cheap noodles and various soups and could do with something nice so I can play Deus Ex and feel at least a little better for tonight before I keep on applying everywhere and wait for my lucky break so that I can tell other people that a situation like this doesn't last forever.  Thanks, Reddit (:
1239	True	a	Our family has been going through a rough time lately. We were involved in a car accident on Thanksgiving, and the other driver (who was at fault) was uninsured. My husband was fairly significantly injured, and dealing with the hassles of medical bills, doctor and surgeon appointments, and suing for damages, on top of resuming school/teaching this week (I'm a graduate student) has left me emotionally, physically, and financially drained.   We have three small kids, and I'm sure pizza would be a huge hit, as we haven't bought food from a restaurant in a LONG time. If anyone would be willing to save me from cooking tonight, I would be eternally grateful.
1240	False	a	My roommates have all decided to smoke some weed and as a result are taking away the much needed nourishment of a college student. Would like a pizza please.
1241	False	a	My little brother and I have nothing to eat and it looks like it's going to be that way until tomorrow. Any help would be appreciated greatly.
1242	False	a	Just found out my great uncle died. Pizza was always a tradition at his house. Would love to have a pizza in his honor, as I'm broke, alone, and family and friends are out of town this weekend, so I'm alone in the apartment.  In Utah, USA
1243	False	a	No sob story, no special circumstances. Would just like a pizza tonight instead of boring, cold food.   Will give in return when my pay check arrives at the end of the week!
1244	False	a	I've been having such a down week worrying about my sick mother, being overloaded at work, how we'll be paying rent and upcoming bills, let alone food, for the next week...I would absolutely love some warm food to help tidy my growling stomach and my mind in the meantime.  Our pantry is bare and I have little $ to my name at the moment.  I'm located in California by the way    I can PM you from my main account, I was just paranoid/ashamed because a simple google search provided much detailed information about me; I use that username all over the web..  Thank you, reddit~
1245	True	a	I would love to give pizza to the family but our funds are very limited for the next month.  We have food in the fridge but there's not a whole ton and we don't get our food stamps until tomorrow.  They don't know I'm doing this but I thought it'd be a lovely surprise if pizza was presented!
1246	True	a	So my husband has gone to Michigan to be with his father who is dying from cancer. He is waiting until his first paycheck then getting our house and a u-haul and us lol. I am leaving my mother and sister behind, and am a bit nervous about it. So until I get there, everything is a bit limited! Would anyone like to spoil me and my two toddlers to a pizza dinner? =D  BTW, this is NOT a crises for food, we have plenty in the kitchen, just wanted something a bit more fun =D
1247	False	a	Hello, long-time lurker here.  I have been eating things out of cans for about the past week and some meaty, cheesy, hot pizza would be amazing.  I will have money by next Wednesday so that I can get some non-canned food, but for now, I'm pretty hungry.  It's finals/report/project season and I'm super stressed out.      More background info: college student in California, third year of my undergrad, broke until next week, etc.    I promise to put up pics once I receive my delicious circle of food.  Also, an e-gift card is preferred because I am about to head to school and I am not sure when I'll actually order the pizza.  PM me and I'll give you my email.  We have Domino's and Pizza Hut around where I am.    Once again, thanks so much!  (God) Bless you!
1248	False	a	I ate a part of a left over salad last night and I haven't eaten anything since. I will continue to be in this situation until I can be able to take the money I work hard for to set some aside to put a little bit of groceries in my home of 7 people. I am one of 3 people working to pay bills so that there is electricity in it and a working phone, ect. I have no where else to turn and I am in need of help. I hate feeling this desperate and could use a helping hand this once. thank you.
1249	False	a	I have a long shift today. And im hungry. 
1250	False	a	Was recently laid off, applied for unemployment last month, however due to the waiting week and a dispute from the company that laid me off, I won't be getting paid for another week! I'm down to 50 cents and a single pack of ramen noodles. Just trying to be able to eat! Help please!
1251	True	a	never thought I'd be here doin this, but I am broke, not feelin well, and very hungry.  I would love to return the favor next month when things clear up for me!  thank you so much for considering helpin me out
1252	False	a	we are all studying aboard and like everyone else here we are having financial issues but nothing that serious. If you are feeling a bit generous today, go ahead and make our day :)  Info: 5 students, 3 Spanish, 1 Canadian and one arabic. Also you can always order stuff online if you dont feel like calling,   Thanks. ^_^ 
1253	True	a	if this is a real thing and people actually pizza other people, then this might actually be the best day of my life!  I can promise to pay anything forward that comes my way!
1254	True	a	Hey there RAoP. Rae here. Longtime lurker, first time poster. I moved to New York State about a month ago, and have been on the job hunt since like, day one. Now, I've finally managed to get myself a job, but it doesn't start until next thursday, and I've got just enough money left in my account for laundry and my phone bill, so until then I'm bumming off of my roommates for food, which I have been for the last two weeks.  There are a whole mess of really great Pizza places within walking distance of my apartment, and I'd really like to get a pie to share with my roommates, as thanks for putting me up for so long.
1255	False	a	Hey there Reddit, I've been working on a art request thread over [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/nxily/offer_art_student_in_dire_need_of_practice_ill/)  But my roommate and I would love some pizza, but can't spend money on it since we're saving for our next semester that starts Monday.  One of my roommates books is $200 D:  and I just need to get tons of supplies.    To whoever buys us a pizza from pizza hut, we'll draw you what ever you want!  Or we'll draw you tons of cats, what ever you want!  (We're also saving for a cat)  We're in Grand Rapids, Mi if that helps anyone.    We shall wait here playing Links awakening, and don't worry if you don't buy us any - go buy pizza for someone that really hungry.  We're just bored and would appreciate a pizza.  
1256	False	a	"Seriously hungry and hoping for some help. Bank surprised me with an new ""maintenence"" fee and made me overdraft, won't be corrected till tomorrow. A pizza would be awesome right now, and it sucks since it labor day."
1257	True	a	For the past two months, I have been trying to get a job (but with still no luck) so I could get the money to pay my college just over $500 by the end of June so I can continue going to school. Luckily, my parents were kind enough to help me pay that by taking on twice as many hours at work. However, with the deadline for the college payment being in the next few days, the house has very little food for the rest of week.   I feel bad that my parents are working so hard and giving up so much because of me, and I would like to pay them back and give them a decent meal for the night (and leftover-lunch).  If anyone is willing enough to give a $12 eGift Card for Dominos to help, I am totally capable of using online coupons like a boss to be able to feed my whole family very well.  TL;DR my family has very little food now and we would greatly appreciate a $12 eGift Card for Dominos to feed the whole family.
1258	False	a	Been packing all day so I can move into a new place tomorrow, there'se no food in the house, and my funds are drained thanks to the new place's rent and deposit.  I get paid Friday so I will pay it forward / return the favor if anyone is kind enough to feed me tonight =)  I live around the downtown Los Angeles area.  Also, as a bonus I am a Computer Science major here at school, so if you'd like I can offer some computer support if you are having any issues you've been meaning to check out (no promises on being able to fix it, but you'd at least get a free diagnostic without taking it anywhere).  Just thought I might throw that in there as an extra incentive =)
1259	False	a	hey reddit,                             we are a 23 and 22 year old married couple no kids or anything but my wife is a student and i work at a crap job. i dont get paid til the end of the week and she just had to deal with some family problems so i was trying to cheer her up. i dont want to go into details abot what shes going through or anything. its personal but i can assure you even the smallest thing at this point would cheer her up. i just love her so much and hate to see her upset. ive used this site before and have bought pizzas for people before i was just wondering if i could possibly get one today and i could pass the favor on at the end of the week. thanks for at least reading this i hope you find it in your heart to help us. thanks again.
1260	False	a	More info: My girlfriend has [Celiac Disease](http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/celiac/#what), so we rarely have pizza (Some places do a gluten free crust, but they are a shot in the dark as to quality). She;s out of town for a couple weeks, affording me the rare opportunity to eat all the wheat I want. Unfortunately, I'm unemployed and won't be getting any money until next Friday at the latest. Would love it if someone wanted to help me in my gluten-feast dreams!  Edit: I'm in Los Angeles - Studio City, near Burbank.
1261	False	a	It is that time of the month where bills are due and money is gone. I usually go to my parents house to get some food when I'm low and down, but unfortunately they are out of town for some time.   Anyone willing to help out a Redditor in the southeast texas area? 
1262	False	a	Am hungry and would love a pizza, been unemployed for over a year, barely make rent and necessities. Cannot afford a luxury item like pizza, but would love one.
1263	False	a	No food in my house and I have to go to swimming in 3 hours.. a pizza would really be awesome! I'll pay it forward someday :)
1264	False	a	I'm a (currently diamond) Challenger 3v3 League of legends player and top 100 in Scrolls. Unfortunately being good at those games doesn't stop me from being hungry, I'm willing to add you on Skype and work with you to improve your game and in exchange we get to be pizza buddies...snacking and playing together.
1265	True	a	thanks for taking the time to read. due to medical circumstances(i work graveyard shifts, have hard time sleeping during the day, dental visits), i haven't been able to work the past week. therefore, i wont be getting a paycheck this week. i had just enough to scrape by my bills, and put enough gas in my car to get me to work and back this week so i can have a paycheck(finally) on the 20th. im usually ahead of the game/curve, pay my stuff early, etc. its just been a rough month.  if anyone feels like being generous, i only have one condition-let me do something in return. you name it(within reason) as long as it is very frugal in nature. i can write you a letter/card, valentines day card if you're a lady redditor. i can make pictures of my kitty. something along those lines. again, thanks for reading.   EDIT- /u/niteflirtgirl is a Pizza Hut secret delivery agent. THANKS
1266	False	a	Someone help a hungry college student away from home get dinner for tonight. I just started my job three weeks ago and won't get paid till this friday. I ran out of food three days ago. Before I got to that point, I was only eatin ramen and canned meats. Please someone help remind me how Pizza tastes. I will greatly appreciate it.
1267	True	a	My girlfriend and I are  broke, waiting on the GI Bill to get around to paying me this month, and have only PB&amp;amp;J to eat until the money arrives. (We're running out of bread.)  So here's my proposition:  If you will buy us a pizza, I will write you a poem, and not just some crappy haiku. My girlfriend will draw a picture to go with the poem. And once the money comes in, we will pay it forward by purchasing a pizza for someone else!  So, any takers?
1268	False	a	Hoping for some pizza. No sob story, just feeling hungry, thanks :)
1269	False	a	I made a request yesterday someone was willing to help me out but it required driving which I do not own a car, If someone is able to help someone else I will return the favor in few days (Thurs) roommate bailed leaving me to cover the whole rent and utilities (ran me broke and had to even borrow money) thanks redditors 
1270	False	a	This week has been really shitty. My best friend came out a couple days ago and his parents won't talk to him. He spent Valentine's Day with me, which made me depressed. I dont think he wants to go back to his house, which I am fine with for now, but I want to help bring them all back together. Anyways, if someone can help us out with some lunch today, that would be cool,, and it may cheer him up a little.  My email address is fapfappington@gmail.com and I will PM a verification code. 
1271	False	a	I am currently going to college and had to spend the remainder of my money on a class recently.  I promise to pay it forward as soon as possible 
1272	False	a	I won't have any money until Thursday and even then it's only $300; $160 of which will go to bills which leaves me with $140 for groceries for the entire month of October. I just want some food when I get home after my 9-9 classes today :( 
1273	False	a	EDIT: Location - Ypsilanti, MI  I get paid biweekly and the beginning of the month drained my accounts (rent etc.) Though I don't want this to become some sappy story. I'm just really hungry and would love if anyone from reddit could help.  I can assure you I'll buy someone a pizza once my next paycheck comes in.
1274	False	a	I tried to do an askreddit a while back about a friend who faces time. It didn't do well so I deleted it. I guess that explains my user name.  I heard about this reddit through the same friend that introduced me to this reddit site.  I have some pics of my place. I don't do so well. My friend said I should use imgur.com.  Edit: I read on sidebar. I am in US but my first language is not English.  Edit: Oh yeah. I could use a pizza!
1275	False	a	Hi, I'm an art teacher in central Arkansas that would love some food!  Unfortunately a recent move has put me a little down on my cash this month but am happy to return the favor as soon as my next check comes in! :)  Thanks!
1276	False	a	So it's the end of the month, and my room mate and I are beyond broke. We have no food left, and no friends/family to borrow food off of. Pizza would be amazing...actually any food would be amazing. Thanks so much!!! :3
1277	False	a	You know you have the badass-ity somewhere deep inside of you. Maybe it's in your wallet. Check there first. Okay, it's in there? Good, here's the back story.  We have no food left for tonight, we're pretty much stuck until tomorrow without any sort of consumables. Yeah, sounds like a fun night, right? Not really? Well, maybe you can be the individual that solves this issue. That's right! For just ONE EASY PAYMENT, you could rest more easily tonight knowing that you helped out a group of four rather hungry individuals, granting them the sustenance to last until tomorrow.   ***This document translated from a received email.***  Original message is as follows: HELLO GOOD FRIEND MY NAME IS RAY ABU BIN AL-AKAY I AM WRITING YOU TODAY BECAUSE THE NEWS HAS BEEN BROKEN TO ME THAT SOMEONE DIRECTLY UPON YOUR LINEAGE HAS PASSED AWAY AND NAMED ME AS EXECUTOR OF THEIR WILL; ONE OF THE STIPULATIONS IS THAT YOU WILL WORK WITH ME IN ORDER TO MOVE THEIR MASSIVE FORTUNE OF 23.000.000,00 USD; AS A PROOF OF GOOD FAITH, I REQUIRE A SIMPLE ACT ON YOUR FORM, SOMETHING THAT ANY FELLOW OF GOD IN GOOD STANDING MAY PERFORM: PLEASE PROVIDE MYSELF AND MY ASSOCIATES PIZZA SO THAT WE MAY HAVE FUEL WITH WHICH TO NURTURE OURSELVES AND SUSTAIN UNTIL THE MORNING THAT WE MAY DRAFT UP PAPERWORK AND BEGIN TRANSFER IMMEDIATELY REGARDS RAY ABU BIN AL-AKAY ESQUIRE  (you should really turn your spam filter on btw)
1278	False	a	So I'm a 19 year old guy who had colon surgery the other day. I've been stuck at home for a while and have depleted all of the microwavable food I've had. I must have eaten 10 packs of ramen over the past few days and a pizza would be great. If anyone is offering, it'd be greatly appreciated.   EDIT: Just found out Domino's doesn't deliver to my house (I live too out of the way, I guess) and I can't leave because of the pain killers I'm on. Only place that delivers is Papa Ginos. Sorry for the inconvenience everyone. =/
1279	False	a	I am getting ready for all my portfolio reviews coming up, and studying for History. I'm super hungry and totally broke. I'd love a slice.  If you order me a pizza I'll send you an 8x10 print of my work :]
1280	False	a	Me and my lady are broke and hungry. We're between paydays, and I just shelled out the last of my cash to get back into classes. If some wonderful redditor would lend a hand I'll pay it forward as soon as I can.
1281	False	a	My friends and I are just hanging out watching some crappy movies on Netflix. As silly as our request is, we'd just love some pizza. It'd be much appreciated.
1282	True	a	We ran out of food and have none left, no money until monday, we must eat something!  We can offer a pic of us doing almost anything [sfw only].  And as a bonus, [here is a picture of me not being able to feed my horse or myself.](http://i.imgur.com/kpmTz.jpg)  *edit* Forgot to mention that our location is Flagstaff, AZ   *edit 2* SmoochyTheRhino gave us a pizza!      
1283	False	a	How is everyone? ME? I am okay, just really hoping for some kind people to help me out today. I will be home alone tonight with my 4 kids and my 3 nephews while my sister attends a party.=( Could you imagine cooking and cleaning up after 7 kids?? (YIKES) Could anyone please help me out tonight? I get paid friday and would be able to pay the randomness back.... Thank you
1284	True	a	"Hello! I've been unemployed since February and so far we've been living on her study loans. Unfortunately she can't get that during the summer - and we got denied social welfare so our debts are piling up right now.  It would be so nice to be able to give my girlfriend a little treat!  We live in Sweden - but I've got a Paypal account.  I would also be happy to take ideas of how we could earn some money! We're kind of out of ideas :) (We've tried to ""get a job"" and we've ""sold some stuff"")  **EDIT: I got pizza money from a very nice redditor! Will post updates within a few days, when I get the money on my bank account!**"
1285	False	a	I'm not really going to sugar coat it, I'm just having a large craving for pizza, but sadly, there's no one at my house to get any, and there's not much to eat that sounds good. I will pay it forward if someone helps!
1286	False	a	Money is being wired to me as we speak, but it looks like it won't be here until tomorrow. My fridge will be empty for at least another day... Will write a true sob story, short story, persuasive essay, one-on-one written RP, play any of the co-op games on my Steam, draw anything to the best of my abilities, or do pretty much anything reasonable in return for a pizza.  Request will expire tomorrow at 10am Eastern because I will no longer require help and I refuse to accept pizza when I am capable of purchasing it myself.  I'm into equivalent exchange and karma, and I will put pizza in a less fortunate redditor's mouth if helped.
1287	False	a	Hey y'all, I'm down to less than a dollar until Friday's check and noodles taste only so good after ten packages of them. Would someone be willing to ship me a basic pepperoni? I'm willing to trade pictures of me doing amusing things that don't involve any orifices and intend to return the gift of pizza in the future!
1288	False	a	Just got out of the hospital, not anything major but I was there overnight.  My roommate left to work out of state this morning (left me an empty pantry and fridge), and the few friends I have here are busy.  Parents are 2.5 hours away and that's way too long to wait for food.  Can Reddit help me out?
1289	True	a	It feels weird and kind of crappy to ask for help over the internet but I'm broke and tired of eating white rice. Its all I have for food until I get paid next Thursday. A pizza sounds delicious right about now.  I live alone and my summer job is winding down. I tried to save money knowing this transitional time between my summer/winter jobs was coming but its just one thing after another, leaving me where I am now - eating rice and nearly broke (if $1.50 in quarters counts as having money). This week and the next are probably the worst I'm going to have it. I just want something hot to eat that isn't rice.  Can provide pics of my kitchen as proof, even my paperwork for a food stamp application if it helps.  Happy holidays everyone  Edit: [Pizza came](http://i.imgur.com/SC3RC.jpg). Wish I could put into words how grateful I am and how unexpected it was to see not 1, but 4 pizzas come..this will last me a while. Thank you. I'm not even sure what else to say besides thank you a hundred times. This is the nicest thing anyone has done for me in quite some time.
1290	False	a	Me and one of my college friends have been living on little to nothing this past weekend till I can get my next paycheck (I work at a writing help center).  Would anyone like to make tonight's Game of Thrones episode watching 10X better?  The nearest joint is a Pizza Hut in Fulton, MS.
1291	False	a	myself and 2 of my friends are planning to do an allnighter but we have no food 2 snack on and was wondering if anyone could help us out  thanks :)  we are in surrey i am kinda new 2 this so i dont know what to do
1292	False	a	Like it said in the post, My car broke down, so i have to look for a new job, broke as a joke and running out of food and heart, could use some cheering up. Thanks a bunch guys! *edit i live in Fargo ND
1293	True	a	I have been unemployed for about six months and recently my dog has had numerous health issues that have led to thousands of dollars in vet bills. I have fallen behind on my mortgage in order to help try and save her. She is slowly doing better but still needs daily medications that I am struggling to pay for. I know to many people it may seem crazy to sacrifice so much for a dog, but she really is my baby. I would appreciate a pizza to help give me some comfort during this difficult time, as I have no family near me either. Thanks for your consideration.
1294	False	a	I spent the last money I had on gas today. Im broke until next Thursday :(
1295	True	a	First world problems here, nothing major.  Short story, I am working on two competing projects within one company (doesn't make sense to me either) and I have tight deadlines on both.  So that means I get to work this weekend in order to even come close to meeting the deadline.  Who wants to cheer me up?  If nobody, that's cool too.
1296	False	a	Worked in a cabinet shop, no work, laid off, need something other that beans , hot dogs and bologna!!!!!!!
1297	True	a	Thought it'd be fun to try this out. Just give me some general prompts of what you want the song to be about lyrically and moodwise....I have a style but can try to please as best as possible.  And no this won't be a crappy cellphone recording. I am in the Chicago area thanks!
1298	False	a	Hi, I have a friend who is in need of help. He lives in Eau Claire, WI, and has just gotten to work for a long night shift. At the moment, he is extremely strapped for cash and hasn't been able to afford much food this week and doesn't get paid till the next. As a college student myself, I unfortunately am not able to send some cash his way right now. If any redditors could please help him out, I'd greatly appreciate it. 
1299	False	a	Hey r/randomactsofpizza, its my birthday, and all i have is cold turkey that probably is bad. Please only consider this if you do noy have to go out of your way moneywise. Thank you for even reading this, and happy holidays! Edit:For clarification, 559 is central california. Agriculture everywhere.
1300	False	a	I'm all alone with nothing to eat this year. I would really love some pizza, can anyone help?
1301	True	a	Hi guys,  I'm pretty much out of money (and food, been eating fish sticks) until the first of January, when paycheck comes out. I can spot some other hungry people when I get paid, I have no way of proving that, but just take my word for it and hassle me if your so kind to give me some pizza :). Assuming a tornado doesn't blow up my house tonight, it would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks guys! 
1302	True	a	So, as the title says, I'm currently broke. Well, to be more exact, I have $2.07 in my bank account, so I guess I'm not out on my ass quite yet.  My boyfriend and I both are students and work part-time jobs, but unfortunately our jobs were both seasonal and now that the school year's pretty much over, so are our jobs. We're looking for work, but as many of you I'm sure know, that can be tough.  I'd really appreciate any generosity from you great folks. A pizza tonight would be really, really awesome. Thanks so much.
1303	False	a	It's been a very tight two weeks, and the wife and I are approaching Friday with a very empty wallet.  We have enough gas in the car to get to and from work, but not enough fuel for our bellies.  We're rocking a solid two chicken breasts in the freezer - adequate for one night's dinner.  We're sitting pretty on a whopping ninety-six cent til Friday morning, and getting desperate as to what we're doing for dinner Wednesday or Thursday.  And then I heard about RAOP.  I promise to whomever helps my wife and I in our time of need that we will pass the good fortune on come Friday.  Thank you for reading this, and thank you for browsing this amazing subreddit.
1304	False	a	Okay I'm not going to lie- I'm addicted to cheese and I've been struggling hard this week. I received a hefty bill and so needs must. But now I'm getting the withdrawals...im bleary eyed and craving hard. Is anyone able to help me!?! Would be greatly appreciated :D I get paid on the 28th of the month but would gladly return the favour! EDIT #1: I should mention I'm in the UK. EDIT #2: I should also mention its been almost a week since I've had any kind of 'tasty' food....please!!!
1305	False	a	I can totally give proof of the broken hand! Was looking for a job when I broke my hand in October and haven't been able to work since. Currently have a plate in my hand, can't work, and medical bills are piling up. And to top it all off, I'm starving! Never tried this before and just seeing if someone cares to give a pie!
1306	False	a	Just what the title says. Husband and I both decided to quit smoking. I went cold turkey, he got the gum. Its been 5 days so far. Food cravings and munchies have kicked in though. I'd love some hot gooey pizza goodness right now. We have Domino's and Pizza Hut. I can pay it forward soon as I get paid, since I'm not spending $40 a week on smoking now!
1307	False	a	Hey guys. This is the first time Ive ever posted here. This is my throwaway though and not my actual reddit account.  Anyway I was wondering if someone could hook me up with a pizza? Im 21 years old and on government assistance (I live on my own and go to school). Ive been having a kind of shitty week. It would be pretty cool to have something to eat, as it'll be a couple days before I'll have money.  Thanks.
1308	True	a	My gf and I have hit some hard times with her losing her job and then unemployment as well for being physically unable to perform her job due to various hand injuries as a server in a restuarant. She is currently petitioning to have unemployment reinstated due to medical reasons for being unable to perform her job, but until then things are really tight and ANYTHING would help us out right now.   I've been both a giver and receiver in RAOP before and would certainly return the favor again when I am able to reciprocate. It took everything we have to pay rent today and some food would go a long ways towards making our next couple of days go by much better with some food.    Thanks :)  Edit: RAOP, not ROAP :)
1309	True	a	Recently, I had to file an extension for my U.I. but my payments ended up getting delayed from it and was force to overdraft a cheque to pay for rent. Thankfully, I'm getting the payments by next week and some incoming gigs(barbacking) by Wednesday. Until then, I only have a few dollars and a supply of ramen. If anyone is willing to make my day by sending me pizza. I would be more then grateful for the random act of kindness.  I have a RAOP verification code if needed. 
1310	False	a	Much appreciated. :)
1311	False	a	Hey everyone! We're a couple who are also a team of entrepreneurs on a budget. We're starving with no food in our fridge currently because all of our funds from our recently completed project are tied up in paypal for another day or so waiting for the funds to transfer into our bank account. We're working late night on projects tonight and hoping someone will keep us alive with a pizza. Would love to return the favor for another pizza loving individual. Thanks! Have a wonderful night everyone!
1312	False	a	My friend told me about this sense things have been a little tight lately due to a separation between me and my wife, enough sob story(herd you guys aren't big on those) but i would love to surprise my daughter tonight with her favorite a bacon and jalapeno  pizza while we watch nightmare before Christmas.  So if someone would be kind enough to help in my attempt to keep her mind off her me and her mother i would be more then happy.  And i will be sure to help someone else when i get paid on Friday.  Thank you all for being awesome!
1313	False	a	College student that just paid three bills and waiting until next Friday to get paid. Your help would really be appreciated.
1314	False	a	Hi everyone I am in kentucky and I am in need of some pizza and sides for my 2 kids .I am broke and dont get my ssi check on my bank card until late tonight and we need something to eat today can anyone help us out thanks
1315	False	a	So spice up my life with a pizza! Broke, it ain't no joke, my landlord wants to get payed, and my stomach wants something other then peanut butter. Figured I would try to get a treat before I sell my laptop!  Thanks, yo.  And feel free to mail me smokes, hardyhar, haven't had one since last Thursday.. but, hell, might as well just quit. 
1316	False	a	[This is my bank statement](http://i.imgur.com/rjhWt.png).  My paycheck on friday might--**might**--get me back to 0.  Rent is due next week.  FML
1317	False	a	Just moved to the city from Austin, TX. Haven't started work yet, willing to illustrate for pizza.  Examples of my work: http://www.seanmatthewleary.com/Site/Portfolio/Pages/Illustration.html 
1318	False	a	Hey fellow pizza-lovers.   It is coming to the end of the semester and I am about at my breaking point. Me and my roommate are bio majors (senior year) and we are currently taking microbiology. FUCKING. HELL. I don't want to go on too much of a rant here, but essentially, our professor is not a very nice person. When hurricane Sandy came rolling through, given that we had missed at least a week and a half of school, most professors took this into consideration and removed certain assignments that were due considering time constraints. NOT THIS BITCH. In fact, she added onto the syllabus. In the end, we had a little more than 400 pts due in the last week of class in an 800pt course. I have never been so stressed in my entire college career and I think my roommate is about to lose it.   Our freezer is empty. We run to the caf when we can (considering its not closed because our school sucks sometimes), but it has been the same food since the beginning of the semester, and quite frankly, makes me piss out of my asshole. With our final in the class coming up this Tuesday, it would really be an unbelievably generous treat to have some pizza to help us study for this test.  tl;dr Poor, frustrated bio majors looking for some brain food.
1319	True	a	We have basic groceries (though not much) until I get paid at the end of the week, but it's going to be a long, busy week for both of us and I would really love to take her for pizza. We have a Pizza Hut sort of nearby. I know it would cheer me up immensely. Thanks for reading. 
1320	False	a	Also, broke as broke can be... with no car. Spent all my money trying to keep my studio alive; if this project doesn't work out, it's bye bye dream time, hello 9-5. Not exactly a sob story, but yea... When I have money I promise to re-pizza!
1321	False	a	My wife and I aren't paid until the weekend and money's pretty tight at the moment.   Any help would be greatly appreciated.
1322	True	a	Hey guys. Title pretty much says it all. I was supposed to get paid today (1st and 3rd Friday) but my anal retentive senior Asian boss says he doesn't have to pay me till Monday (closed Sunday).  I'm not starving to death right now or anything but I could really use some food for the sake of work tomorrow. If not thanks a lot for what everyone does anyway. I'll pizza it forward as soon as I can either way.   PM for my info if you can. (U.S.)  *edit* forgot to mention had to put my jingles into my gas tank today to get to work. Hence the brokeness.
1323	False	a	Amherst Ohio here
1324	True	a	Hi amazing people! I've known of this subreddit's existence for awhile now, but have never participated. I guess now is the time, even though I'm on the other side of where I'd like to be. Currently, I'm very very hungry. I have no groceries in the house and unfortunately am going to have to wait until Thursday after 2pm (payday) to buy groceries again. I know that I could make a pizza last until then. If one of you guys could help me out, I'd be forever greatful! I'll even draw you a picture! I'm not an artist, but it's the thought that counts, right? I also pledge to return the favor sometime in the next three weeks! I have to give myself a little wiggle room because bills. Tons of bills.   Edit: I can definitely provide proof of my empty fridge and bank account!
1325	False	a	Normally, I would cook, but it's a bit difficult to stand up right now and there's only eggs left.   I'm in the Northern NJ area.   [Obligatory picture of cat](http://i.imgur.com/aowimKb.png)  Thanks!
1326	False	a	This is my first RAoP post, so I don't really know what else to say...Guess I'll start here: I moved to Philadelphia in August and got a job at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, but I got laid off right before Thanksgiving because of over-hiring. I've yet to get any good reception from the places I've applied at, its at the point where all I have to eat right now is ramen and stale Tostitos. I tried filing for unemployment but since I'm not yet a PA resident (originally from South Jersey) I'm ineligible.   My roommates have been giving me food but I feel bad mooching off of them for so long, and I'd like to be able to give them some food for a change. That's where you guys come in.   Well, that's about it. Thanks for reading.
1327	False	a	My brother is home from college and we would appreciate it. 
1328	False	a	Dota 2's The International 3 is this weekend (popular competitive video game).  I'm not as close to my brother as I would like.  He's 8 years younger than me.  We've had our differences in the past.    I've invited him to come down to NYC for the geek-out tournament watching weekend.  He's old enough now and I'll also buy him drinks and expect to have a jolly good time.  If anyone would like to participate in this brotherly bond in the making, you're more than welcome to!  He arrives tomorrow afternoon.  Thanks!  [edit] brotherly, not botherly. LOL.
1329	False	a	Would love some pizza to keep me going and to hold me over for the rest of the night. 
1330	True	a	Ok, ready for the sob story? Got kicked out of an apartment and screwed out of my security deposit because the landlord's secretary made a mistake, my car broke down and then had two windows smashed, got robbed for a $700 financial aid check from school (gonna take six months to get it back now), and now the guy I did some painting for has just disappeared without paying me. So yeah, I'm broke and starving..staying at a friend's place in exchange for taking care of their pets. I've been living on my own since I was a teenager and I've never been in such a bad spot like this - made a throwaway because I'm honestly ashamed at the state my life is in right now.  The good news is that I just got hired somewhere, so in a few weeks when I get paid I'll pay it forward to someone else who's down on their luck. thanks in advance. 
1331	True	a	I've been wanting a pizza for a while but all my money has been going into gas to get to and from school. I only have 6 dollars in my wallet and would greatly appreciate a pizza. I'm in mississippi if it matters.
1332	False	a	Just finished my thanksgiving leftovers for dinner tonight...but now its about time for that 4th meal. Pizza would be the best thing ever right now! :D
1333	False	a	It's times like this I rethink my choice to become a writer. Why didn't I ever consider the cost of pizza?!
1334	False	a	Today is my boyfriend's 18th birthday. I'm not able to see him today (sadly) and I want to send him something to let him know I'm thinking about him. Flowers and chocolates are typically for girls. Haha. He loves pizza. This is perfect. Does Reddit wanna help? 
1335	False	a	Hey all, I'm a poor college student(what a surprise) posting here hoping to get some pizza. why do I need pizza, you ask? well, it's midterm week, and as a Senior in IT, i'm fucking stressed. I just learned today that my parents are getting a divorce, which was honestly not a surprise, but it still kinda hurt. I usually get by on shitty overpriced Cafeteria food but I just lost my shitty job mopping floors at Shaw's a couple weeks ago and there are ~no~ other jobs in my podunk little vermont town. All I ask is if someone can send some breadsticks or a Small pizza for me and my equally hungry Roommate, it would be mightily appreciated.
1336	False	a	I just finished my first week of treatment in an intensive out-patient program for depression. Due to medical bills and being on leave from work, money is a little tight right now. I'd love a pizza to celebrate being on the road to recovery and finally seeking out the help I've needed.
1337	False	a	Hey Reddit! I turn 21 today and its a great feeling. However my family is gone for the rest of the day and won't see them until the late evening. Could one of you guys make my day! Thanks
1338	True	a	Due to my own financial stupidity, and some bad timing, the entire paycheck that I receive tonight will go towards rent/late fees/utilites (specifically, water and trash.)  If anyone decides that I am in any way worthy of a pie, I will ration it off for as long as I need to (I have a few canned vegetables that will do as well.)  I will gladly pay anything back/forward, and do simple requests.  I live in Raleigh, North Carolina.  I appreciate anything in advance, even if just looking.  Gracias, amigos/as!  
1339	True	a	I am pretty hungry and I thought it would be nice to have a pizza with my family. I live right outside of Cle Elum, Washington.
1340	True	a	Had my phone stolen off me twice in two months, my insurance excess is pretty **ridiculous** and have had two teeth pulled earlier this year. Money is really tight at the moment (due to insurance and whatnot ) and a pizza would really help alleviate a bit of that and make me feel allot better.  I have been pizza'd before through a private message and have done the same to someone who seemed depressed and jaded in a unrelated subreddit. I now have to change my whole life/routine because of the fear off seeing the same bastards again. They are fairly local and one of them was arrested for the robbery(hence retaliation). Police couldn't give a **single fuck** anymore as they have someone arrested even though there are still 2 others out there and I'm getting threats. [proof of crime][redacted]  **Edit!!** Not Starving!- Can get by without (have *just enough* money to survive), Just want cheer me up pizza, that's all
1341	True	a	Hey reddit,  I've really hit some hard times recently, lost my job, kicked out of my apartment, car broke down. Pretty much anything bad you could imagine going bad in one's life, it has happened to me.  All my family is in Colorado, so moving out there is pretty much out of the questions. So right now I'm crashing on my buddies couch, but I'm not sure how long that will last or how long until he loses his mind and kicks me out.  I would love to be able to pay him back someway or another, and pizza popped into my mind. Being as it is a Friday night, and I don't have the fund to do much anything but breathe and drink free water, I'm not going out tonight. Anyone have it in their heart to help out a fellow human being whose life has hit the skids? 
1342	False	a	Hey RAOP! I have been broke for the past few weeks with roughly .30 cents in my bank account and have been eating nothing but rice and noodles for the past week. Would be awesome if I can enjoy a pizza tonight. Thanks!
1343	False	a	"Hi reddit. I'm a theatre major in Columbus and I'm wondering if someone could buy me a pizza. I've been working on a lot of projects and wrapping up the last week of summer classes and a greasy pizza is just the thing to kick start my night of work. To aid in my plea, I propose a trade! Here is a poem I have written for you, redditors of /r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza! Enjoy!  -ODE TO PIZZA-  Oh sauce, saucey sauce,  Tasting you makes me feel boss,  Spread you thick, long and wide,  Dick jokes are poem cyanide,  So let's talk pizza, with all that cheese,  Bread, butter. *Greeeaaaaassseeeeeeee*  On the rack, on the tray,  Pizza on pizza? So **deliciously** gay.  Mushrooms, peppers, onions and chives,  Get the fuck out, MEAT SAVES LIVES!  That was a pretty bad rhyme so I'll make it up to ya,  By ending this poem with an evil doll **""HOO-HA!""**  Zombies ate my neighbors y'aaaaalllll"
1344	False	a	it's new year's day here in mendoza, argentina, and everything is closed.  no delivery.  no supermarkets.  no (few?) gas stations.  i've just moved into a temporary apartment while the mother and brother of a friend with a new baby stay in my apartment.  and i don't have much for supplies in the house-- i haven't had time to stock up on much other than gatorade and water.  not even a bottle of wine.  i think there are a couple of bananas and an egg...  is anyone up to the challenge of getting me a pizza today?  i'm in central mendoza (chile and colon)  i'll pay it forward. if you hook me up, i'll hook up someone up back at home.
1345	False	a	"So one day two redditors decide they want to start a petting zoo. So one redditor said to the other redditor, ""you go out and find the land, I will go out and find the animals."" They agree and set off on their ways.  So the redditor out looking for the animals was walking down the street when he sees a roster store. He walks in and tells the guy he wants to buy a rooster. They guy says, ""okay, but we don't call them roosters, we call thems ""cocks"". ""   He says, ""okay"", buys the roster, and sets off on his way.  He continues walking down the street when he sees a chicken store. He walks in and tells the guy he wants to buy a chicken. They guy says, ""okay, but we don't call them chickens, we call thems ""pullits"". ""   He says, ""okay"", buys the chicken, and continues on.  A little while later he is walking down the street when he sees a donkey store. He walks in and tells the guy he wants to buy a donkey. They guy says, ""okay, but we don't call them donkeys, we call thems ""asses"", and there is something very peculiar about this ass, you have to scratch his ass every five minutes or he'll die. ""   Its the last donkey in the store, so he says, ""okay"", buys the donkey, and sets off on his way.  So now this redditor is walking down the street, all three animals in his arms when five minutes go by. He gets really frantic, runs up to the first redditor he sees, and says, ""*will you grab my cock and pullit, while I scratch my ass*?""  "
1346	False	a	I'm sitting here with no where to go and no one to talk to for the moment. I've had a rotten hangover all day I can't shake and I'm starving. Can someone please help?
1347	True	a	Hey guys, this week was the week my rent was due and because of that, I have about 20 dollars to last me for food/public transit to work every day this week until I get paid on Friday. A simple pizza would be appreciated, and in the future, I can try and get you a better pizza in return. Thank you, and I appreciate the help, if I get it.
1348	False	a	We have our son who came to visit and we are so embarrassed as we didnt know and dont have much to pick from. We live on a limited amount of food a week for a family of 3 . So we are asking for a pizza for 4 . We would really enjoy it and would love to sit like old times with our son and talk . I am the only one working as my wife has Lupus and cant work anymore. So living on one pay check is very hard . There is nothing left for a yummy cheese pizza . We havent had a good pizza from Papa johns in ages ! We would really enjoy it for Sundays dinner . Thank you 
1349	False	a	Hey everyone! Today is my now 8 year old son Logans b-day and we kinda strapped for cash so i was wondering if anyone could bless him with just 1 pizza for tonight. I hate to ask but it'd really make his day, he loves pizza more then anything lol. Thank you all so much :)
1350	False	a	"So I posted this on my facebook today:  ""Hi, I'd really love a pizza and a handful of sedatives. First chick to furnish both wins a date with me and a pillow covered in drool.""  A friend responded with this link. Nothing special about my story, but here goes. A bit over a year ago, I bombed out of college. Hard. After that, I was unable to find a job, even in the pizza industry, where I have 3.5 years experience, 1.5 of those in management. Throughout the year I have been bouncing around between cities, going back to Eugene and Corvallis for a time, and eventually went to Texas because I wanted to meet a girl I'd been talking to online for a year and a half or so and was quite enamoured with. That journey was a complete disaster, and months after I wound up back in Portland, I still think about it everyday. I still can't find a job... I interviewed at Voodoo Donuts the day before yesterday, and by now I would have heard back if I'd gotten the job. I feel like I kicked ass at the interview, but most 'cool' jobs in Portland are always won by scrubby hipsters and overly-tatted indie/rocker chicks. I'm an electronic musician, an artist, and writer, and slowly over the last year I've been watching a lot of the stuff I use to do my work break or disappear. My speakers broke, so I can't properly make music, I ditched 80$ worth of art supplies while I was trying to hitchhike to Texas, as it was weighing me down. My laptop's hard drive fried out but I was lucky enough to trade a much smaller one for some computer repair work. I've been couch-surfing various places this whole time, right now I am staying at a nice rasta lady's house with her schizophrenic ex-boyfriend and his mother, who has alzheimers. I'm lucky in that I get to stay in a room that is half-filled with their storage stuff yet has a bed in it. But I can't remember the last time I had a good pizza. Nevertheless, there are certainly people worse off than myself and if I had stumbled upon this sub-reddit on my own, I would've though that it was awesome, but would likely not be requesting pizza on it. However, since it was suggested to me, I figure I might as well give it a go.  What can I offer you? Well, I can send you a bunch of mp3s of my music, mail you some drawings, or perhaps help with some editing work if you have any writing you need someone to look over, whether for school or for personal writing. I live in the St. Johns neighbourhood of North Portland. Hope I got everything I need here, lemme know any questions or otherwise. Thanks reddit."
1351	False	a	Any pizza's good pizza ;)
1352	False	a	I found an article in CNN about raop while stumbling and it was like a sign. I've seen reddit before but never made an account so this is a good a time as any. Me and my daughter are going through some rough times. I'm single and work my ass off in a school cafeteria for minimum wage to try and make ends meet. I'm pretty broke right now and I really don't know if I can do rent even. I hate not being able to provide everything to my kid because of circumstance. Our food stamps haven't come in yet so we're pretty much out of food. I really don't know what I'm going to feed Lexie for lunch. If some kind stranger could help us out with a pizza it would be very appreciated. 
1353	False	a	Hey Redditors!  I will give you the code for a new $25 Nike gift card in exchange for just $20 of pizza! I am super hungry for pizza but all I have is this damn Nike gift card. Help me eat and I'll help you buy stuff!  Thanks everyone
1354	True	a	Hi everyone! I'm a physics grad student with a 6 year old daughter who want some pizza. We live in Albany, CA (next to Berkeley). We don't have any money because my soon-to-be ex-wife (daughter's mother) is sick (multiple sclerosis) and can't work. Bank of America stopped paying her disability pay back in January and my research stipend isn't even enough to cover our rent. So my choices are top ramen, peanut butter and jelly *again*, or a random act of pizza.   Her mom is busy being fed at restaurants by her new boyfriend while we're here in the apartment struggling to get by. So some pizza would really hit the spot right about now.  Your kindness will be greatly appreciated.
1355	False	a	I'm pretty broke and have nothing to eat. Nor the ability cook something without giving my self food poisoning, so please give me some pizza! In return i can write a poem about anything you want, i'm no Carol Anne Duffy but i'll write it to the best of my ability. Please someone respond. I will be completely willing to return the favour as soon as i get some money. Thanks for taking a look.  Also i'm very sad, but a pizza would make me happy!
1356	False	a	For the life of me, I can't remember my user name once again. I thought it was coltboy to begin with?! Last time I was in here I gave away a couple of pizzas. Now things have taken a turn for the worse with someone in my family having cancer, the bills associated with that, and I have committed to working on my second degree so I'm in college for another round. I'd just love to have some real food if you can help a hardworking, responsible guy out.  OH MAN Nevermind! Whew! I just checked my Papa John's rewards and I have enough for a free pizza! How did that happen?! I swear I thought I only had 10 points! How did I get 20 more points when I haven't ordered pizza in ages?! Looks like I'm good for the moment, folks!
1357	False	a	(Sorry, I didn't put my location in before)  Well, I had some unexpected finance troubles (who doesn't! ) and I'm out of luck (and have been for a couple days) food-wise until I get paid on Monday. Whether or not this works, I'll be back next week to do this for someone! Thanks in advance for reading and enjoy your weekend everyone! :)
1358	True	a	I just made my first down payment for college, I couldn't pass up a great deal on a laptop for classes, I have more down payments to make and a truck to fix in the coming weeks.   When the dust settles and my account isn't being sucked dry, I will gladly pay it forward :)
1359	True	a	**UPDATE**  [Pizza Received](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6159/6233102156_02e71819cf_b.jpg)  At home on Sunday night and every other night after sunday, and spent the weekend limping around around house with a torn MCL. I am also an unemployed college grad who has been eating frugal and healthy for a long time. Would love a nice warm tasty pizza.  Will pay it back when employed.  Sacramento, Ca
1360	False	a	Cafeteria's closed, can't deposit my first check from work until tomorrow (the ATM at the bank was out of envelopes!!!), got nothin in the way of snacks or frozen food. A hot pie would be extremely appreciated on a gloomy Sunday night like tonight. 
1361	False	a	I haven't drawn anything lately and we're broke until Friday. [Here's my deviantART gallery](http://androidar.deviantart.com/gallery/) so you can see my skill and what I usually draw. All characters and species of my own creation (minus the Ponies of course). I can do sketches and I'm pretty fantastic with MS Paint, if I do say so myself.  I will draw something for someone in exchange for a yummy warm pizza for the 3 of us (Fiancee, son and myself).  If someone is feeling more than generous in their pizza giving (more than one pizza, extra tasties), I will have my talented fiancee bring life and colour to the sketch. She's awesome.  Thank you.
1362	True	a	Hey there Reddit. Things haven't been going right for the next few days. My [roommate and best friend](http://imgur.com/ALJUP) started having suicidal thoughts a few days ago, and ended up checking herself into the ER for observation. I've just paid off rent, two weeks late, and have no money until Thursday. And my younger sister came over today because she keeps getting sick at her apartment, which means there's two mouths to feed and not much food to go around.  I'm lonely, sad, and worn down and I'm hoping that some pizza and silly tv shows might turn that around. Thing is, there's no pizza currently. If anyone is willing to donate some I would be insanely grateful.   Thanks in advance.
1363	False	a	I was stupidly laid off of my last job and have been without work for the past two months. I could definitely go for a pizza. In return I'll send you something precious of your choosing.   **EDIT:** I live in Kansas. Close friends with the Kents. Haven't seen Clark around lately. Would love a pizza instead.
1364	False	a	I'm 20 and live on my own. I'm not poor or necessarily starving or anything but I cant just order a delicious pizza for just myself. Costs too much. Well, hopefully the pizza gods will smile down on me today, thanks guys.
1365	False	a	i was driving on the highway when the driver behind me lost control of his f150, as i was slowing down to get off the exit, all i hear is a lound shriek, and everything turned black. i woke up, looked around and was just amazed at how i was still alive. anyway i dont have a car anymore, lucky to be alive. THe other driver was ok too. Anyway i would appreciate anyone from the reddit community who would like to help cheer me up with a slice...or two.  PIC: http://imgur.com/NN4BR
1366	True	a	EDIT: User IamSeth saved the day!!! Thank you so much! http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1g3me0/thanks_iamseth_your_generosity_fills_our_hearts/  It's been a difficult couple months for my boyfriend (22M) and I (23F).  He is currently unemployed and looking for a job, and I am self employed, but all my income has been needed to cover our bills while my boyfriend has been out of work, so there is absolutely nothing left.  I spent the whole afternoon trying to get local assistance to put some money on our M-Power card (a pay-as-you-go program for electricity here in Phoenix Arizona) to NO AVAIL : ( all our local agencies are either full for appointments or not assisting those without children in the home.  So we are keeping our apartment dark and very warm (it's currently 108 degrees outside!) having to be extremely cautious with any ac use as our electric is about to run out.  My boyfriend ran around today using the very last of our gas going to job interviews and the required drug testing.  We could really just use a filling dinner so we can collect our thoughts and regroup since we need all the energy we can get to figure out a way to cover our very basic needs until we get more income.  There are no groceries here, I actually used the last of what we had here (some vegetables, rice, and tuna) to feed our two dogs.  Of course we would be incredibly grateful with any form of help from anybody.  A Pizza Hut gift card would be amazing, and any other help as well.  I do understand there are other subreddits for assistance also and I will look into those guidelines to see if it is appropriate for me to post there too.    In exchange for any help someone can give I would like to make you a small beaded item.  I could do a brooch or a pendant with seed beads, crystal, felt, some semi precious gem beads I have here.  You could tell me what colors you like and I could make something for you or a loved one.  I am open to suggestions.  Included are examples of what I can do.  http://i.imgur.com/4rTLqft.jpg http://i.imgur.com/HVsPqO6.jpg http://i.imgur.com/ycN1RI2.jpg  Thank you for taking the time to read this.
1367	False	a	So I currently have $3 in my bank account and a job's been hard to come by with every place I've been to being fully staffed due to the holiday season.  If anyone is feeling particularly generous, I'd greatly appreciate a pizza to live off of for a couple days.  
1368	True	a	I have a 6 year old who broke his leg today, he is very sad because he cannot go outside and climb. My wife and I have no money to eat out because we had to pay for his medical expenses, bills, and food this week. Please help me put a smile on his face tonight. 
1369	False	a	I'm a 20 year old college kid in East Tennessee who works retail but doesn't get nearly enough hours. I'm out of money until Wednesday and seeing how I have never tried this subreddit out, I figured it couldn't hurt to join this community if I will be accepted. I promise to pay it forward later on in the week when I get paid! I hope you guys can make my night since I'm home alone on a Saturday, haha. 
1370	False	a	Had to pay off a huge vet bill and I'm broke until Friday.  Could use some pizza to have for dinner and take leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks!
1371	False	a	Pizza would hit the spot and be an amazing early birthday present to help me from succumbing to sleep instead of studying up!
1372	False	a	I'm making a pit-stop in Denver right now and am staying at a friend's house, so delivery pizza is a possibility for me for the first time in about 2 months. Also yesterday was my 24th birthday and all I ate was ramen and a pack of oatmeal. If you buy me pizza it will be obvious to everyone that you are cooler than a pack of peas :D.
1373	True	a	"About a month ago I lost my job and my wife and I were barely able to get by and we got a bit of help here and there from family and friends and a pizza from a great redditor.  Unfortunately things got worse.  I still havent found a job and three nights ago my wife moved out because ""im not providing so why should I stay"".  And while I know she has a point ive been left more or less crippled at home.  No job.  No money from no job.  No car now.  And she took the cat...  And ive spent the last moth sellung anything I can to make money.  Im at around -500 in my account because I overdrsfted to make my phone and lights stay on.  My phone is my only means of computing or communication I sold the cokputer.  Anyways I havent eaten in a few days and only vary sparingly before that and would just like a pizza to make me a little less depressed.  Any help would be greatly appreciated snd anything I can do back I would in aan instant.  Thank you"
1374	True	a	Money is incredibly tight right now as I just sent my son to Walt Disney World with his high school marching band for spring break (right around $1400).  Judging from the last surgery I had on my gastrointestinal system, it will be at least 10-12 months before I will be able to enjoy pizza without a fair amount of discomfort.  I might even come out of this totally lactose intolerant, which, holy Horatio Cain, would be a terrible, terrible blow.    I'd like to spend my last evening with solid food for the forseeable future the way anytrue blue redditor would: on the couch, consuming pizza while watching Archer and Lost on Netflix.  
1375	False	a	One of my close friends is in need of some guy time, his family moved back east and after his uncle committed suicide last week he's been a little torn up (he had to go to the funeral alone). I would like to give him some solid man grieving time. A friend gave me some beer from a party he threw last week but if someone could give me a coupon to Papa Johns I promise to do the same next month.  I'm running short this month due to some legal fees I had to pay and some of the extra money I make as a contractor won't get into my bank account till the end of the month. All in all this is just shitty timing.
1376	False	a	I'll keep it simple. I'm broke because of some unfortunate events. I'm working all day in a crappy mall with no food. I would really love a pizza. If I get a pizza today before my shift ends at 9pm EST, I'll buy two different users on RAOP a pizza on Tuesday.   Edit: Tuesday is my pay day. 
1377	False	a	So... I guess I put my little sob story here.  Well, I'm poor, lonely, and hungry, and longing for some pizza to fill the emptiness in my soul.
1378	False	a	 I work in a restaurant and my manager is firing people and cutting hours. I am now only going to be working steadily 2 days a week, and next week I go back to school, so finding a second job right away with any flexibility is gonna be difficult. The bf and I have irons in the fire, but we're stressing out and worried about how we're going to get by. A hot pizza and a reminder that acts of kindness are still occasionally possible in this world would go a long way toward cheering up our little family.  I'm in the Louisville KY area. Thanks reddit!
1379	False	a	Would love a RAOP to cheer me up this rainy day
1380	False	a	As the titles says I took my last final of the summer semester this morning and would love a pie to celebrate and to enjoy while packing up my apartment to move tomorrow!
1381	False	a	My dad, my mom, my sister and I live together in a basement apartment with a family upstairs, so we're not the most fortunate either but it seems like other people may need a pizza more so by all means give it them if you want. We get a pizza on Saturdays, my mom doesn't make that much and it'd be cool if I could effectively make it free.  I live in Ontario, Canada. =)
1382	False	a	My son will be 1 on Friday. He does eat pizza and anything else dont worry because he has 10 teeth. Early birthday present anybody? :)
1383	False	a	I'm short on personal cash, and want to do something nice for my husband.  He has been infinitely awesome to me in the last year and a half, dealing with me being in grad school, student teaching, and miscellaneous other issues.  I still can't grok how much he's done for me out of the kindness of his heart.  Can the pizza spirits bestow a worthy gift to this kick ass husband of mine? He takes his lunch at his desk around noonish. He is a redditor, and probably post-stalks me periodically.  In the interests of keeping his work location secret, I'll post details in PM only.  Thanks in advance!
1384	False	a	Thank you so much, candreacchio, for coming through for us! It's late here, but I will order tomorrow and update with a pic!
1385	False	a	No great sob story here, just some students getting ready to go back to uni in a few weeks looking for pizza to brighten up a very rainy Sunday evening.
1386	True	a	I picked the lights.  I've had some unforeseen costs pop up and I have $20 to my name until next Friday.  There is a Pizza Hut and a Dominos close to me.  If anyone could help I'm starving and I'll pay it forward in a week.  Thanks ^__^
1387	False	a	So I live with my BF we are both unemployed currently. He has been searching for a job for the past 3 months after being laid off with no such luck, which is really beginning to take a toll on him. I have recently lost my job last week as well. Bills/rent are coming up in the next week and we are still scrounging/selling whatever we possibly can. We have began running low on food within the past week (instant rice, cereal, and ramen). were afraid that if we go to buy groceries before bills/rent are paid off, we will not have enough to pay them. A pizza would be a nice change for dinner and quite possibly even help my BF to keep his head up and not get discouraged his job hunting.
1388	True	a	"I'll spare you my sob story. Pizza would be indescribably awesome! This is my first time asking and I'll definitely pay it forward.  edit: F5, don't fail me now! If you can beat the crap out of the Reddit alien, surely you can help  make some pizza magic!  edit2: I would walk 500 miles and I would walk 500 more just to *be* the man whose pizza gets delivered to his door.  edit3: Mediocre, random, boredom and hunger-inspired fact: one of my highest scoring posts ever was a video on how to fold a fitted sheet.  edit4: I used to be a delivery guy. Cheesesteaks. On a very regular basis, customers would take several minutes to answer the door, yelling ""HOLD ON!!!"" open it, huffing and puffing, sweat rolling down their faces and half naked bodies. They were usually about as attractive as you'd imagine chronic cheesesteak takeout-orderers would be."
1389	False	a	My best friend and I share a one room apartment and for the last two months have only been able to afford ramen, if we're lucky. Neither of us get help from our families and we finally both may have gotten  jobs! (i'm going to my interview in about an hour) We would be eternally grateful and would love to celebrate with some pizza!  
1390	False	a	I don't like asking for hand outs, honestly, but some Pizza for my boyfriend and I would be fantastic and beyond appreciated!
1391	False	a	My roomate and I (two average college guys) just finished a crazy week of midterm exams and got rather drunk last night with a bottle of 151 and have the morning shits. Now we are broke/exhausted/hungover/starving and would seriously appreciate a pizza and you would be forever in our debt. 
1392	True	a	My girlfriend has been in the hospital for the past eight days, recovering from a very dangerous  but very successful (YAY!) cancer surgery.  I've been balancing  taking care of our 3 year old son and visiting the hospital for the past week, taking time off of work.  I'm quite hungry.
1393	False	a	Hi there, i'm in a spot of bother and my girlfriend just left me for a good friend of mine. I feel like utter crap cos i spent all my money on her. i am new here but could really do with some help plus its my birthday soon :). thanks, Dan
1394	True	a	I've locked myself away and am zealously working on several sites for a client demo this Tuesday. Za' would be greatly appreciated and fuel my desire through this stressful day.
1395	False	a	I have tons of ramen noodles but I really don't feel like eating them and I don't have the money to actually order a Pizza (I have $30 until Thursday and my gas tank's on E) and I would just LOVE a dominos philly cheesesteak pizza like you wouldn't believe.  Edit: I have a pounding headace right now probably because I haven't eaten all day lol
1396	False	a	I have a gluten-allergy unfortunately but Domino's makes gluten-free pizza that I don't react to!   I would appreciate this like crazy and am genuinely planning to pay it forward asap. 
1397	False	a	Hello everyone! I'm usually a bit of a lurker on here but I decided to ask for some help today. My husband is feeling really depressed today, we both got laid of from work a few weeks ago and haven't started getting unemployment yet/found work...things have been very hard. We used what money we did have on bills and rent. We have run out of food in the house (today is the first time this has ever happened) and won't be able to get any until we can go to the food bank on Tuesday. I would love to be able to surprise my husband with some Pizza please. I know a treat like that and a funny movie will help make him feel better for at least a little bit. I will only be able to reply to pms sent before 4pm central time as I'm at the library (one of the bills we had to cut was internet, ugh).
1398	False	a	Hi all, I am a broke uni student studying for exams. I have a buy one get one free code (so I have lunch and dinner for tomorrow) for domino's as well. I will pay it back when I Get the chance. Thanks!
1399	False	a	My friends and I are trying to have a fun night before they leave for Seattle and we don't have enough money for pizza. Could someone be generous enough to supply us with pizza?
1400	False	a	my family of 6 could really use a hot meal 2nite, i am sorry if this post has repeated, i am 2 this, still figuriing it out. i will gladly pay it forward 2morrow 4 any help 2day. please help. 
1401	True	a	I'm broke for another two weeks and so dang hungry for some good eats. I paid my rent today, and got my phone turned back on, and now I've got nada to last me until my next check. Not to mention, I owe some money to the bank due to some ridiculous overdraft fees that I did not intentionally incur. My rent check was cashed by my landlord really late, after I thought he'd already taken it out a while back. I had to ask my roommate to cover the utility bills until I can pay my half later (I'll be sharing the possible pizza with her too, she's an angel).   I'm steadily working on a film my friends and I are making, which I love, but buying supplies for what I want/need to do along with paying my bills has left me in a bit of a rut. Frankly, I fucked up on my budget. I have an interview for a second job tomorrow, which I'm pretty stoked about.   Other than that, I love pizza, so naturally Random_Acts_Of_Pizza is freaking awesome. If someone meets my request, I'll pay you back or someone else once I get back on my feet in a few weeks, no problem.  
1402	False	a	My boyfriend's hours got cut So we can't afford to do anything for my birthday
1403	False	a	so, my brother and his g/f just moved out of our apartment a couple weeks ago, and it's been great having the place to myself until i can get a new roommate... unfortunately, it's left me also having to pay rent and bills entirely on my own.. which, as of this week, has left me with $2 in my bank account, no more food in my fridge, and a really big appetite, since i've had (literally) nothing but ramen for the last two days.  i would really appreciate any help, and if this works out, when i get paid on Thursday, i'll make an [Offer] thread to try and pay it forward.  thanks in advance!!
1404	False	a	I've never been pizza'd before, so someone will need to tell me how this works. I can get to any of the big 3, but I and my wife prefer the Hut.  In a couple weeks, I'll pizza someone else. Again, I've never done this so someone will need to tell me how to pizza someone else.  Whether I get a pizza or not,  I'll still likely pizza someone in the coming weeks.  Thanks guys!!
1405	False	a	Would love some grub as I'm in the process of moving out. Last bit if my check went to final months rent but fuck all that, a free pie would make anybody's day. 
1406	False	a	I would really appreciate any help that someone can offer. I am with two friends studying for our last nursing final, tomorrow morning. Graduation is so close and yet money seems to continue being a month to month struggle. Again, anything will be greatly appreciated!  P.S. I told my friends about reddit and they had never heard of it. I showed them how it works and how entertaining it is. They love it, but they don't believe that random acts of pizza actually occur. I even showed them pictures, but they won't believe me. Anyone want to help me out with proving how awesome reddit really is too?   
1407	True	a	Being 17 and being payed $30 a week to walk a dog (with gas for the car taking up about $25 of it), I can't really pay for pizza that much. So, if anyone's feeling the Pizzamas spirit, hit me up!
1408	True	a	Hey guys so I just heard about this subreddit, it's crazy how great of a community this is. So I've been watching over my younger sister and 2 brothers (10, 8 &amp; 7 respectively). For the past 6 weeks now, we've been staying at my mother's house while she's away. I love em Im a lot older so i took care of all three since they were babies I'm almost like an uncle haha. I've been paying all the bills except the rent. I work part time as a janitor while they're at school but have to be at the bus stop when they get off every day. On food stamps so we get by but we're running low and they honestly don't get a treat like this often. So yeah I don't want to post a whole story of my life but if there's anyone out there who's willing it would be truly appreciated! Im not asking for much, just a large pizza or maybe 2 mediums? Any questions, just ask! Thanks.
1409	False	a	Hoping to pay it forward when I get some extra cash. Pretty awesome sub even if I don't get pizza.
1410	False	a	No sad story, just wanted to try for a random pizza.  Thank you!!
1411	False	a	Not unusual around here, I take it -- but I'm an unemployed and pretty damned broke college student, and I'd really, really like some pizza while working on my last final projects. Beans and rice just lack a certain something.
1412	True	a	I don't get paid until next Friday, and the last packet of ramen was used for dinner a few nights ago. I've got pickle juice and mayonnaise in the refrigerator and I'm not sure even sure if the mayo is any good... A hot meal would be majorly appreciated.  Edit: I forgot to mention that when I get paid, I'll return the favour. It'll just be a week.
1413	False	a	I lost my job about a month ago and have had no luck in finding a new one. I just ended up having to move back home as well because I could no longer afford to pay rent. I'm not starving or going to go hungry, but a pizza would be really great right now, and I would much rather have it than easy mac for the 4th night in a row. I'll happily repay it as well once I finally have a job again!
1414	True	a	I have to survive somehow until next Friday, when I get paid, until then I have to survive day-to-day and eat anything I can find. On my way home from work, I remembered this sub-reddit, I'll be happy to pay it forward regardless if I get helped or not. This situation has made me realize what how difficult tough situations can be.
1415	True	a	Haven't eaten anything besides Cheerios and ramen noodles for the past week. Would appreciate some Dominos cheesy goodness. Thanks for looking!
1416	False	a	I don't have a canvas long enough to paint a vivid picture of my sob story, so I won't. Instead, I devised a few riddles for you to have fun with. If you enjoy the challenge they present maybe you'll reward me with a gift card for my cleverness? It never hurts to try. So here you go, a few riddles to toy around with while you debate whether or not I deserve a hot meal today.  1.) What's 4 inches long but can house all of your buds?  2.) If I press hard enough I might strike a face that makes me a wealthier man. What am I?  3.) How many links are in the chain when it clinks?  4.) Right now may not seem like spring at all, but I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow, and then all of these will belong to you.  5.) I had a cat I named him Earl. I had a fish I named him Pearl. But what should I name my bird of prey?  I hope you enjoyed my little challenge of wits, I'll post the answers later regardless of whether or not I receive a gift card. So best of luck and see how many you can get right. And if you feel like helping a guy a bit down on his luck eat tonight feel free to message me or post below.   Thanks again and remember, a mind is a terrible thing to waste, but it's even more terrible to waste a mind.
1417	False	a	My fridge is busted, my house now smells like death and all the food (mostly delicious thanksgiving leftovers which I so looked forward to eating) is ruined. My landlord said he will replace fridge this week, but in the meantime I'm hungry and broke. Will someone help this girl out with some pizza? Thanks in advance from Cali.  
1418	True	a	I tried this once before with no luck.. figured I'd give it another shot. Thanks for your time!
1419	False	a	broke college student, would love to taste pizza on my tongue tonight. hook me up!
1420	False	a	That'd be pretty cool(:
1421	True	a	My roommate and I are moving in the next couple of weeks and we both are pretty much out of money due to rent, utilities, and such. We're planning on having a game night tonight and would love if some kind redditor would be willing to donate a pizza to help us game into the night and forget about our money problems.
1422	False	a	I was able to save myself a bit of hassle by duct taping my transmission. I am still broke, but the Jeep lives! Pizza me today and your favor will returned Wednesday (11Sep). I live in Kentucky on the TN border.
1423	False	a	My roommate and I have been studying for finals for awhile now and we realized that we are completely out of food and would love a pizza if you would be willing to send one our way. :)
1424	True	a	Stuck at work until midnight - not much around to munch on. Feel a bit guilty - ended up spending my pizza money helping out some people in /r/assistance. Will gladly pizza it forward after the 28th. 
1425	False	a	Just thought I'd give this a shot. I'm a designer whos work has really dryed up recently, so I'm in the process of finding full time work. I live in the Newcastle area in the UK. Just after a treat for a boring night in on my own. I'm going to return the favour when I get work. Cheers
1426	True	a	"My friend Kate is one of the most talented special education teachers I have ever met and is an expert on assistive technology (namely communication devices). She gives voices to many people and has made the lives of countless individuals and their families better through her dedication and relentless work as an educator. She also happens to be the unluckiest person I've ever met - she currently has a broken foot, a uterine tumor, diabetes, a broken car all on top of being broke from student loans and medical expenses.   She posted a status on facebook tonight that said ""At home 3 days with a broken foot, a broken down car and the bank still hasn't sent me a new debit card. Anyone who wants to pay to order me a pizza is welcome to, I can't take anymore Ramen. On the upside I get new X-rays tomorrow and maybe they can figure out why it hurts so much. And my car should be fixed by noon tomorrow."" and I immediately thought of you guys at r/R_A_O_P and hope you are willing to help me help her out and let her know that the world isn't always out to rain on her parade. She is located in Massachusetts and I can provide proof if necessary (I'm kind of new to how r/R_A_O_P works so forgive me if I'm doing this wrong)"
1427	False	a	Hey Reddit, looks like my family (me, wife, 3 kiddos) have to move house ASAP -- our landlord was foreclosed upon. We're handling the temporal stuff as best we can, but we sure could use some comfort pizza to help us out sometime in the next few days. We could even use the pizza boxes for packing! :-)  Thanks in advance, will definitely pizza it forward once things settle down here.
1428	False	a	Firstly, this is a throwaway account because I really don't want my mother to know I'm struggling, and she stalks my main account. If you want to see my main account (its over 2 years old) I'll send it to you in a pm and prove its mine. :/  I got back into town today and all my roommates stuff has been moved out, along with every piece of food in the house. That means I have to pick up his half of the rent which means i'm really broke. :( A pizza would really help if anybody is feeling generous tonight. Thanks! 
1429	False	a	Ok so I'm a mom of three got paid today but my bank is holding the check for some reason. Out of food completely in my house.: -\  was really hoping to get a pizza or two will return the favor as soon as I'm able to touch the money in my bank. 
1430	False	a	Music ain't paying too well and all I've got left are 4 slices of bread, and some butter until I get paid on thursday... a large pizza would keep me going for the next 2 days or so... I can verify however you wish.  I'll send you some songs I have recorded to say thanks if you wish :)
1431	False	a	Throwaway as my only other account is a gonewild one :p. Anyhow my boyfriend i just moved into a new apartment in seattle, paid all the fees, deposit, first months rent and moving costs and even had some cash left over before our next paychecks to buy food and necessary stuffs. Came to get our keys this morning,  all our stuff in cars and a moving truck to find out the landlord had expected us implicitly to pay a two hundred fifty dollar fee when she agreed that our cute black lab rescue, bowser, could live with us. She in no uncertain terms told is it was the deposit or no dog, we paid up. So now we are very hungry  and we could use a pizza- not bowser of course; he has lots of food. Which will hopefully remain a last resort. 
1432	False	a	I've been job searching for a bit now but haven't had much luck or funds for pizza. My accounts actually overdrawn at the moment and any more cash would cause some bullshit overdraft fee so thats out of the question.  Could really use a cheesey pick me up :)
1433	False	a	Hi Reddit! Today's my birthday! Yey? I don't know if I should be excited about that.. My dad has just recently moved to WV for a new job, but I can't come with him since I still have classes here in LA.. This is the first time I'm living alone..  Help me out?
1434	True	a	I have one dollar in my bank account, and things have been pretty rough financially.  Honestly, it's really hard for me to ask a random stranger to buy me a pizza, but my stomach sounds like a civil war right now and I'm starving.
1435	False	a	"So turns out my gf has bronchitis and when she went in to work her boss made her leave in fear of ""infecting the other employees."" So now we're just hangin out at home, about to get down on some halo 4.  The only thing that could make this day more perfect, aside from her getting miraculously better, would be a nice tasty surprise from someone nice.  Will provide pics of us enjoying said pie, and if we can get a good shot of it, us beatin face.  Cheers!"
1436	True	a	My partner and I will have been together (in person) 7 years tomorrow (April 16).  We meet online while I was teaching in Korea. When I finished my contract, I went home (NZ) for a month before I flew to Sweden to meet him in real life. Prior to that we'd Skype 6-7 hours a day, email and send letters  Life has been really hard. I haven't been able to go back to NZ, we had to go through his family company (no fault of their own) going through bankruptcy, moving country and visa issues.  We left our jobs at the end of January and moved out of London in the hopes that we could find a place to settle down and have kids.  We lived in at our jobs and worked together in a very stressful situations that really began to affect our relationship and health. Another reason we needed to move.  We've found it really hard to find jobs since though we've applied for everything and anything, pub jobs, cleaning jobs anything.  Tomorrow is our 7 year anniversary and we can't afford to do anything. Which is ok, we still have each other and we're getting along really well again despite the pressures and stress of both being out of work and worried sick about money.  Anyhow, a pizza tomorrow night would be well-appreciated. And the favour will be paid forward as soon as we're in work again. __________________________________________________________________  Thank you for your response Lolly, or maybe tack is more appropriate.  
1437	False	a	Not quite sure how this works.. This is the first New Year I will be without any company. I think there are about 4 other guys living on my floor, but I don't know them. Of course, I can't finish an entire pie by myself so I would love to share with them as well!   I'm here on campus to get some work done before the new semester starts. For the past few meals I have been subsisting on just rice water. In return, I can offer a (poorly) drawn on Paint picture of your request! If you could help, it would be really appreciated. Thanks and Happy New Years to everyone!
1438	False	a	living with a crazy vegan health nut who thinks our baby should only eat tofu and wheatgrass and green smoothies with Chia seeds. My baby wants to EAT ALL THE PIZZA! I decided to leave it up to fate...that's where you come in. SOMEONE PLEASE GET THE PREGNANT LADY A PIZZA!
1439	True	a	I pretty much just want to eat some pizza and watch a cheesy romantic comedy, possibly a tear jerker and forget about my week.  Papa John's would be cool.  Much appreciated.  Edit: Pizza'd by pizzamom!  Thanks so much!
1440	False	a	I'm starving, but only have $40 bucks in my account which I'm saving to use to take my lady this weekend to celebrate her College graduation. I would really appreciate a pizza right now! Thank you.
1441	False	a	We've been eating noodles for two weeks now and I won't have any money until next Monday. If anyone could help it would be greatly appreciated!
1442	True	a	As a rock climber and guitarist, I've been bummed out since I screwed up my elbow ten days ago. I'm behind on rent, bills, and loans already, forgot about automatic bill pay this Monday, and I am overdrafted until my low-pay check on Friday. [Can't get this melancholy but beautiful song out of my head](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ5isLBu_To).  Chicken is nice, and these are definitely First World (Boston) college student troubles. My light at the end of the tunnel is a comp sci Bachelor's (and job?) in December, but, man, pizza sounds like pure love right now.   Edit: The unassuming delivery guy handed me an unexpected cold soda and set of garlic bread, along with a huge pizza laden with sausage, prosciutto, and peppers. I couldn't stop grinning. A thousand thanks to anthonybsd!
1443	False	a	Hey everyone.  My mom is a registered NICU nurse. She works graveyards, 12 hours a shift, 3 nights a week. She worked last night and is working tonight as well. She works incredibly hard for our family.  While she's been asleep today, I've been working on cleaning the house. I'll admit, I'm a bit slacking on this subject and it's usually done by mom.   I figured, what would be better than waking up to a clean house? How about waking up to a clean house AND dinner?  Unfortunately, I don't have any money. I've been unemployed for 2 months now and must put all of what I have left into my credit card bills. It's kind of uncomfortable asking others to feed you and your family, but I figured it wouldn't hurt. I promise everyone here that I plan on buying some pies for others, regardless of anyone helping today or not.  I appreciate you taking the time to read this. Lets make my moms day!  P.s. we live around Sacramento, CA.
1444	False	a	Dreamin' of a Pizza, waiting for a locksmith.  It's been a long day. A long groovy day, save for a moment of brilliance wherein I bravely locked my keys securely away in my vehicle. I was startled by a child with a airsoft pain inflictor; instinct demanded I slam the door shut and turn to face the culprit. I am a smart, brave man.  Anyway, evening plans are kinda shot now. I'm chilling out, waiting for a locksmith, hoping it won't eradicate the funds I need to float on blissfully towards that next paycheck.   If I am blessed by pizza, I'll happily pay it forward. If not, I may be forced to hunt down and devour that small child.
1445	False	a	So my truck was stollen from my car port last night :(. An 88 Toyota Pickup. Why anyone would want it is a mystery to me. Probably just stoll it for parts and tires. Anyhoo, it's shitty and I think a nice pizza would cheer me up and make the research I need to do to find a new (new to me :)) vehicle a little easier to deal with. 
1446	False	a	i'm 35 today! i'm trying to celebrate, but i'm piss broke. 
1447	False	a	I have about 15.00 in Amazon payments credit and I don't feel like waiting for it to deposit into my account. I'm also craving some pizza...so, I was thinking I'd have some fun.  Whoever orders me a pizza tonight and sends me their address will get a random gift chosen by me shipped to their house. It won't be a junk item, I will try to get creative and thoughtful with it. I won't tell you what it is so you'll just have to wait and see when it arrives.  My inspiration was a cross between RAOP and RAOA!
1448	False	a	College student, just got gainfully employed but don't start until a week from now and won't get paid until end of month. The other job I work has a check in the mail but it'll be close to a week until it gets here, clears the bank, and I can get some food in the apartment. I'm working from a 6 month budget that had a $2000 shortfall. Sad thing is that I'm already one pizza behind in paying it forward. I have a couple wrinkled potatoes, frozen potato stuff, frozen fish, a little frozen fruit, about 10 eggs, some rice, a little bit of frozen peas, one packet of kool-aid and some coffee, and a box of macaroni and I can't eat any more of that stuff without puking - I just can't force any more of it down my throat like I have been the past two weeks. I had my laundry money planned out for this month to the quarter only to find the landlord increased cost per load by 50% without telling anyone so I'm tapped out of cash. I have maybe 20 miles left in the tank to get back and forth to work and then to the bank to cash my paycheck (that's still in the mail and won't arrive until Monday or Tuesday depending on the whims of the mail service).  I know there are people in worse shape but if someone would be so kind as to send one my way? I know it's too late tonight but tomorrow, perhaps?
1449	False	a	Hey RAOP!  Recently I found a new job after being laid off, I haven't had the ability to celebrate in proper fashion due to funds going towards keeping a roof over my head and electricity on. Was wondering if you guys could help me celebrate with pizza?  I shall pizza it forward once I get my paycheck as a token of my gratitude! thanks!
1450	False	a	I just have no money right now and am tired of eating pasta and refried beans :\ I will buy one when i get paid! this is my first time on here! :) i have a pizza guys around that will deliver....10 bucks for an x-large cheese!
1451	False	a	Well, I'm hungry, and my mother is pretty poor for the past few months so my dinners consisted of poptarts or ramen for the last month or two. Would be nice if I could get a pizza from Dominos or something tonight :].   Edit: forgot to say my location is Long Island (NY)
1452	False	a	I am single mother i have no food in the house and do not get paid for another day or so. It would be amazing if someone kind soul would feed me dinner tonight. Me and my daughter would love it!
1453	False	a	So I'm moving from the Chicago northwest suburbs to denver soon and am flat broke untill I sell my truck. I'd love some pizza to fill me up tonight!
1454	False	a	Crushed my Engineering homework, my Calculus II midterm, and even a Chemistry assignment. Got so much done today, so I'd love to top it all off with a pizza when I get home tonight! Thanks RAoP, I'll pay it forward next paycheck :)
1455	False	a	So a friend I haven't seen in a while to hang out with a few other people that came over tonight. This happened unexpectedly and, unfortunately, I couldn't plan ahead as he is broke and so are we. We only have a bag of broccoli in the freezer and without sounding totally pathetic I decided, as a last resort, to see if RAOP could possibly help out with this predicament. Once I get paid, I will absolutely pay it forward on here.  Number of People: 5   Location: Athens, OH   Have Verification Code: Yes  
1456	False	a	It's my 18th birthday today and no one has seemed to remember it! Even my parents! I know i've kept it quiet but I cant help but feel a little un-loved :( Please may I have one little moment of joy today? Even if it is just pizza :) I would be soo grateful! xxx
1457	False	a	The last few months we've been eating rice noodles in chicken broth at least five times a week for dinner. A pizza would be a very welcome change, and we would very much appreciate it. There's just four of us, so we don't need much.
1458	False	a	PM for details. If you can't that's alright. Other people need it more than me. I don't even know if some pizza places still deliver this late either.
1459	False	a	We're in Tampa Florida...moving to Ybor on Friday. My email is usfstuff@yahoo.com, since I'm having major trouble figuring out reddit's message system.   My two roommates and I have found a new place to live and are moving in on Friday. The rent is $1100 including utitilies and internet. My 2 roomies have very nicely offered for me to just pay $200 a month until I have a job. I am so thankful to have them as friends! This month all of us are extremely poor from paying $2000 to landlord (first+last rent+deposit). We also had to pay $310 for TECO to turn on the electricity.   I would just really love to do something nice for them and pick them up a pizza and a sub/pzone. My one roomie doesn't love pizza and she only ever gets a sub/pzone haha. Using a few coupons, I can get 8 pizza rollers, 1 large pizza, and a pzone for $11 from Pizza Hut. If anyone can help me out I would be so grateful! Pizza Hut is just the cheapest, if you have something else in mind let me know. I have an interview on Thursday so keep your fingers crossed!   The pic for our huge TECO deposit :/ http://imgur.com/B0uoo
1460	False	a	Yesterday my cousin walked in on my girlfriend and I and blue balled me. Left in anger to a friends house, came back in the morning to find my girlfriend passed out in the living room with my cousin and his gf in OUR bed, naked and asleep, where I was cut short of glory. This was after about a week and a half of not getting any at all. Now my gf and her 2 friends are at the beach and I'm home alone with nothing to do. 
1461	False	a	Roommate and I are very poor, and also drunk off of jug wine. Very Hungary too. Help a brotha out?
1462	False	a	Before I give details, I want to apologize for my previous request. I'm desparate for pizza, and bored out of my mind, so I may have possibly made a bogus request looking for pity. Then a friend told me I was an idiot and I should be honest, so I deleted that and made this instead. (Bad first impression is bad. :/ )   So I'm off tomorrow, and the 'rents don't get paid for another week, so we have gatorade, brocolli, and ramen for food, and I'm in a desparate mood for a pizza right now. I'll eat anything, really, so don't worry about giving me the wrong type or size; I'll eat it. I've got $1.90 to my name, so I can't afford water, much less a pizza. xD  In Missouri, USA. PM if you're willing to help a Reddit/Internet-addicted brother out.  And again, sorry 'bout the bogus request a bit back. When I crave, my stomach thinks for me.  Edit; I managed to get a friend to hook me up with something, but thanks anyways guys (not to whoever downvoted me. Thanks fo nothing, &gt;.&gt;).
1463	False	a	All my roommates have left for the night to go party...and im home sick, if any of you guy would cheer me up and gift me a pie it would be greatly appreciated
1464	False	a	"I just want to say, ""thank you,"" in advanced to all you kind souls.  I'm at a breaking point today and I really, REALLY *despise* asking for handouts but I've had a couple nervous breakdowns since this AM.  **Here's my situation:** I'm beyond broke.  A couple of medical bills from the end of last year have put me WAY off my budget and I'm trying desperately to catch up. I'm behind on my mortgage, car and lights. On top of that I got stopped yesterday by the police while travelling from one job to the next and found out my license has been suspended from an old fine I forgot to pay.  So this morning I had to get my license straight, which costed $275 that I didn't have.  The best part was finding out on the way home this AM that my water got cut off.  That costed me another $180 that I didn't have.  I've never been so desperate in my life.  I need help, more help than a single pizza, I know, but one meal would mean the world for me right now.  I've got nothing in the cupboards to cook tonight and the money I was planning to buy dinner with is GONE.  I get paid tomorrow so a little kindness tonight would go such a long way.    I have three children and they are the real reason I'm asking for this tonight. I have a daughter, 9YOA, and twin boys, 2YOA.  One of my sons has a congenital heart defect and has been through three surgeries.  I'm a paramedic and I'm working as hard as I can to provide for my kids and allow my wife to finish school.    I can provide proof if needed through PMs.  Please, someone, find it in your heart to assist me this one time.  I don't ever ask anybody for anything, I'm usually the one helping others."
1465	False	a	No big sob story.  Actually kept going back and forth to even post this.  Long story short, broke till payday, need some lunch.  Once I decided I will definitely pay it forward when I get paid, I figured what could it hurt.  Also seems to be a really fun concept to be a part of.    In closing, thanks.  As stated, I will be back at the end of the week to pay it forward to others.   
1466	False	a	Hey RAoP!  Tomorrow (Sunday Sept 22) is my only day off of work for the next 3 weeks. I would really enjoy being lazy and not having to cook, and with the rainy day that its supposed to be a pizza would be fantastic.  Will use Verification System.  I'm off to sleep for now, have a good night everyone! 
1467	True	a	I just recently moved out on my own and things are tough. I was laid off 2 weeks ago and now I am feeling the pain. I am going to be really behind on rent and I've had to cut costs. The biggest impact was groceries and gasoline. I can't afford to go anywhere. I haven't had meat and I am SUFFERING. I have been relying on rice and steamed vegetables for the past two weeks. Pizza would be a blessing right now.
1468	True	a	My mother and father's business of 20 years tanked last year and they've been struggling ever since. I live with my mother, and my two younger sisters in house that we can no longer afford to keep. We're moving into my grandparents house next weekend. Apart from my mother's disability checks, I am my immediate family's only source of income. I work part-time and make about 100 bucks a week.       If someone would be kind enough to hook us up with a pizza it would be much appreciated! :)
1469	True	a	Hey guys, I was just in the r/assistance part of reddit and was linked to this subreddit. I dont really know how this works as it is my first time, but i'm hungry. I can give you the long story, but we all have ours. Basically im so broke its sad. I live paycheck to paycheck and I have overstretched myself this week and im hungry. I have rice, but 3 days of rice and even the most desperate of people will grow tired of it. (I also have been eating it plain due to no soysauce) :/  If anyone could send me a pizza I would be more grateful than I can express. I can pay it back as well, but not until next friday when I get paid.   thanks
1470	False	a	On my own in student house over the summer - pretty bored and lonely, ran out of money last week and not due any until loan payment in September. Been eating basics from my cupboard for the past few days - I probably won't starve, but a pizza would make such a big difference right now. Won't be able to pay it forward until mid September when I get lots of money, but when I do I will buy a couple if someone helps me out. Thanks for your time reddit. 
1471	False	a	It is 9:16 on a Friday night. I'm a senior in college and I am trying to get out, which is why I am working rather than partying.  edit: working and redditing
1472	False	a	Hi RAOP, my car brokedown over the weekend and it will be fixed tomorrow but I can't buy groceries till payday. Luckily thanksgiving is this week so the leftovers i can get from both sides of my family will hold me over until then so anything could help between tonight and turkey day. Its just me by myself so 2 pizzas max would do.
1473	False	a	Had a bit of a talk with a close friend of mine last night about the environment of my group of friends post-breakup a few months ago.  Someone in the group had apparently continued to obviously flirt with my ex (who I'm now cool with) in spite of others warning him about my feelings on the matter.  I don't acknowledge his presence anymore and overall I'm over the breakup, but it still hurt to be reminded of that moment.    It would be nice to know that there aren't inconsiderate people out there.  I'm at home today, resting and trying to get my mind off of things.  Some pizza would be nice...
1474	False	a	I just got home from a long bicycle trip around NJ only to find I had missed some important mail from UI.  I have enough food in the house to survive until I get it straightened out, but I could sure use a pizza.
1475	False	a	No pitiful sob story here; I have a paypal account with enough money in it to buy pizza, however, Domino's doesn't accept paypal in the US and I don't have any other money. I'll gladly repay the cost of the pizza once it arrives at my door. PM me for order and address and whatever else you need.  Thanks in advance, RAoP!
1476	True	a	Here is why today sucks:  -Guy I've been seeing for a little over a month socked me in the face last night, so that's over.  -Can't find a fucking job.  -Roommates just ditched on us after eating our food and not paying bills... because they found a better place.  -Don't get foodstamps refilled until the 9th.  -Totally coming down with something.  Damn it, I would love someone forEVER if I got pizza'd. I'm in New Orleans. The only thing close-ish to me that delivers is Domino's.  Le sigh.  **EDIT: Thanks to czhunc, I'm nomming on some delicious chicken-bacon-spinach pizza right now, there's another pizza next to it, and this is an amazing end to a day that started out the crappiest in recent memory. czhunc rocks my face off (and breakfast tomorrow is going to be AMAZING)!**
1477	False	a	I am a single mother of 2 who recently just took in my Brother and his family (wife &amp; son). My brother was in the USMC and got out early due to medical issues and we figured we could make it work, but unfortunatly due to the economy he has had a difficult time finding a new job and we are all trying to survive on my salary alone. He did take AND pass his postal exam yesterday so please pray for us that this leads to something great. If anyone could find it in their hearts to help us out a little it would be greatly appreciated.also if you need any other information in regards to this situation or would like a verification code please message me. Thank you for taking the time to read this &amp; God Bless
1478	False	a	Hey RaoP! I'm writing on behalf of my roommates (and myself!) in request for some pizza!  We're extremely low on cash at the moment due to rent and the last bit of money we did have, we can't access due to a stolen debit card :(  If anyone would be willing to give us some pizza, we'd be really grateful!  My roommate, [Foolgroove](http://www.reddit.com/user/Foolgroove) will even draw you a picture :)  Thanks,  [Saeka](http://www.reddit.com/user/Foolgroove)  [Foolgroove](http://www.reddit.com/user/Foolgroove)  [Zonku](http://www.reddit.com/user/Foolgroove)
1479	False	a	I Just paid my unexceptedly High Teco bill that turned our grocery budge into a kool-aid and raman noodles budget. Pizza for me and my son would be greatly appreciated 
1480	True	a	I dont like doing this.. the whole asking a stranger for help thing. Ive always been more inclined to give than receive. Unfortunately, here I am with a request.   I live in a 2 bedroom apartment in Escondido CA. I have been paying rent here by myself for 2 months. Last month I finally found a roommate that seemed so promising. She gave her security deposit of 100 bucks and was planning on moving in tomorrow (june 1st). Two days ago she backed out.. I have 700 bucks in my account and dont get paid for 2 weeks. My rent is $1200. Needless to say I am freaking out.   I havent been shopping for food for 2 weeks, I have beans and rice left thank god.. Im starting to look like shaggy from scooby doo since I cant afford a hair cut. Im using TP from my work and dandruff shampoo as hand soap. There have been better days.  Look, I have been a RAoP reader for a while and I have always wanted to buy some deserving stranger a pizza. I know that there are people who deserve this more than me. Its kind of depressing having my first post here be a request. But this is my promise, the second I can afford to help others here, I will. The karma will be passed on. Im just at a low point and a simple pizza would really brighten my outlook.. thanks for reading guys. You all rock my socks with the kindness Ive seen here.
1481	False	a	I've been filming my first short film/documentary all week and I finally just hit editing stage. I got so wrapped up in filming that now I have to edit 60+ minutes of footage in around 10. I'm dedicated into making this as good as possible.   Oh and the short documentary is about people's reaction to the word dick and their views on masculinity. If you guys are interested in seeing the finished product I will definitely post it up. 
1482	False	a	My friend and I are currently Models for Mygirlfund but they take 3 business days to transfer my money into my bank account so I don't have money for anything else right now. We have 3 dino nuggets left and they taste like sponge anyways! Will repay back once my money goes through :( Please help two starving inspiring models
1483	False	a	Hi! I'm a student away for summer school....it's a huge opportunity for me, but it meant I had to come with no money.....been scraping with what little I have....it would be GREAT to have a simple bacon and spinach pizza...anything would be nice though....thanks! :)
1484	True	a	hi guys, earlier this week i tore or otherwise really messed up a tendon in my shoulder while at work. i just spent the last of my cash putting gas in my roommate's car so he can get to work. i'm down to chocolate milk, dry rice and canned peas until i get paid tomorrow (thursday) night and i'm in too much pain to even use my dominant hand to type, let alone use pots and pans and try to cook something that doesnt even seem worth eating to begin with. and of course a pay it forward or a thank you pizza for the donator will be the least i can do, guaranteed by end of day saturday.  i appreciate your time, this took me a long time to type with only my non-dominant hand &gt;.&lt;
1485	False	a	Here's a pic of us after making one of our masterpieces :)  [pic](http://audaciousfaith.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/dsc_0072.jpg)
1486	True	a	I'm fearful of being labeled a scammer or something after reading a lot of the other posts here, but I assure you this is genuine. My wife of 3 years left me and took our 11 month old daughter a few days ago. She didn't take too kindly to me finding out she was cheating on me. As bad as that is, she took our EBT card right before we were to go grocery shopping, leaving me heartbroken, alone, and without food with a week to go before my next paycheck. My stomach growling is honestly the least of my problems at this point, but I was told this would be a good place to try to get some dinner and solve at least one of my issues, or at least an open ear. I'm going to spend quite a bit of time on here today, as the sense of community throughout the entire site is quite impressive and will hopefully serve as a distraction to what I have going on. Thanks for reading, and I hope whatever deity you follow blesses you in every way possible.  Edit - Thanks to miafria! What a great community and people. 
1487	False	a	This month has been really hard on my family and I. We have had to pay our rent, car, and gas all late because of shortened hours at work. I am the only one working right now because my wife is on maternity leave which makes money really low. I have two children who love pizza and have been affected by this unfortunate turn of events. I promise to pay forward as soon as I get more hours from work.  
1488	False	a	I promise to repay the favor in the near future.  
1489	False	a	Nothing super depressing, just poor timing. My car broke down two days ago, and I had to use my grocery money to fix it. I've been living on the pasta I had left, but I cooked the last of it earlier for lunch. I get paid tomorrow and would be more than willing to send pizza back to someone in thanks, but it might be nice to have a bit of dinner tonight if possible. I have a verification code ready and waiting as well, if that helps. If someone should be so generous, I don't need anything fancy. It's just me here. A one topping large from Pizza Hut (are they still doing the large one toppings for 10 bucks?) would be perfect since PH is pretty close.
1490	True	a	Hey guys, I just paid my rent here in Richmond. I have maybe 2 to 3 dollars left in my account? I haven't had a nice hot pepperoni pizza in awhile (besides those cheap mini frozen ones)! Also, just found out this morning that our Internet cut out because of the wiring in our building? But I still had to pay the bill for that last week despite complains of no service. Anyway, just looking for some kindness of random pizza!
1491	False	a	Nothing really big going on for Me, just don't have the cash for any pizza right now and I'm craving it. I will pass along the favor when I can afford it. Thanks reddit!
1492	True	a	I have 5 boys for the weekend and cash is running low. Would love to give them a pizza party tonight with your help of course ;) We have dominos and pizza hut that deliver to our home  Thanks in advance.
1493	False	a	Id love to give her some relief, but I can't afford it. Message me if you can help. You guys rock..
1494	False	a	I'm broke and sick of eating pasta. I just heard about this website, figured posting would be worth a shot. Saw that you guys like honesty so that's about it. I have food, it's just bland and been the same thing day after day.  anyway... I don't expect anyone will help but like I said, worth a shot.
1495	True	a	I seriously love buffalo chicken pizza. Like, straight up addicted. There's a local pizzeria that delivers and they make the best buffalo chicken pizza I've ever had; however if you dont feel safe with that or have a Giftcard to a chain I could care less, I just want a buffalo chicken pizza soooo bad! 
1496	True	a	Any size pizza will do, considering that I'm the only person home and I have no car or real amount of money at the moment. All meats are good, no veggies.   Edit: meant real amount of money, not pizza.
1497	False	a	If a pizza were to show up at around 11pm at 606 Catherine St., Ann Arbor, MI 48104 a new 4th of july national hero would be born! You'd make independence day for 3 friends that much more awesome!  edit: reward - an imgur album of the us 3 enjoying the pizza, and doing whatever the hero desires or anonymously writes on the box via special instructions, as well as some awesome real life karma
1498	True	a	I'm looking to trade 15$ from my paypal account for a pizza hut giftcard. I'm flat broke and extremely hungry and I got some money in my paypal but unfortunately it would take a couple days to transfer to my bank account. I will send first but please be reputable/flair because I would hate to get scammed.
1499	False	a	My name is Alaina. I'm 6 months pregnant, and we need help. Our family is large and we're running out of food. We won't receive our food stamps for another week, and no one has any money to even attempt to buy food. We're hot, hungry, and would be extremely grateful if we could receive anything.  **EDIT:** I'm willing to prove my situation via photos with date stamps in a PM.
1500	False	a	Location: Chicago  I'm a bit under the weather, and after having worked an 8 hour shift starting at 4:30am yesterday, my sleep schedule is a tad fucked. So I'm wide awake at one in the morning.   And I would adore a delivery of any hot food right about now. There's only so much canned split pea soup that one person can consume.  Love and luck to all my fellow service industry workers on St. Paddy's day weekend!
1501	True	a	Help any others that NEED pizza first, but I am hardcore craving a 'za and it would make my week. I will be paying it forward with my paycheck next week as well :D Thanks for your consideration!~
1502	False	a	Hey all, I just had a root canal yesterday and I don't feel like cooking the left over veggies. With rent, I am zeroed to only 50 cents in the bank. I just started a new job which takes 4 weeks to receive my first pay check. I've been relying on free food at work, vegetables and potatoes (we have a farm share at work). If you can help that will be great. 
1503	False	a	Wrapping up my last semster of college, amongst working part time and getting paid bi-weekly I have no food at home to speak of, what with an empty fridge and bare cabinets my hunger grows to an inmeasurable depth. Can a fellow anon help a redditor out by putting some pizza in their growling stomach. I will return the favor when my part time job pays me at the end of the month. 
1504	False	a	Could really go for some cheesy goodness to commemorate this joyous occasion.  Here's proof: http://i.imgur.com/YF7oU.jpg
1505	False	a	Hi, my name is Deborah. I used to help run Burlington Emergency Shelter in Burlington, VT. It is a shelter to help provide housing for up to 22 homeless men and women. They only run on donations. No Federal or State funding is used. They rely on donations to provide a meal each night for their guests. Their guests are ordinary people that either lost their jobs or just couldn't work anymore. I personally know what it is like to be homeless as I had went to the shelter in need myself.  I would like to request that someone or some people would provide pizzas for a meal for the homeless. 10 pizzas would be enough. If anyone would like to help, you can find the shelter's website at beshelter.org. It would make alot of someone very happy!
1506	True	a	Hi. My name is denise. I am a 65 year old disabled veteran. I suffer from agent orange among many other things. I am coming to you today to request a random act of pizzas to fill my belly. My money ran out quick this month and I don't have food for today. My favorite pizza is pizza hut. I do plan on returning the favor when I can afford it. I was referred to this site by my grand daughter.
1507	False	a	I heard ya'll give out pizzas. Can I have one please? I really don't have a story. The honest truth is that it's 85 degrees here and I just don't feel like making the house any hotter by cooking. I've got all my fans going and it's still pretty warm in here. Can you help me out with some dinner please?
1508	False	a	August 18th is my bday and I love pizza, however it is really expensive, and me not having a job, can't afford it! so hopefully one of you guys out there are willing to send me a pizza! message me!
1509	False	a	"I have been trying to make life happier for my children, since my wife went into rehab. They know that their mother is away, but I've had a hard time sitting them down and trying to explain where she is. When they ask I tell them that mommy was sick but she is getting better. Every pay day she would disappear for weeks at a time. I would drive around until I either found her somewhere, or she would come home with no money and ""no clue"" as to what happened with her paycheck. Supporting a household on my own was not something I was prepared for. I try to juggle my bills so that the most important bills get paid. I offered the power company half, but they would not accept it. I had to make a choice between getting food and having my kids stay in a home without power. We are down to 3 cans of tuna. We can eat on one pizza for today and tomorrow, as I get paid on Monday. I have a 5 year old and an 8 year old. Please help us.  "
1510	False	a	I'd love a pizza and I'm in Austin, Texas! Just finished my first year at UT, big accomplishment! Craving pizza and a break from packing.... Help a sista out?
1511	False	a	My best friend broke his ankle, and i would like to see if anyone out there cares to help me get him dinner, as he is using all of his cash on medical expenses, and He cannot work, due to not being able to stand. If needed, i can give a picture as proof. To anyone that reads this, this is NOT for me, and i would really appreciate the help :]  EDIT: North Texas. Sorry :]
1512	True	a	Isla Vista, CA. Down to my last few dollars on my last week of school, with nothing but Top Ramen left. I almost think all the sodium is starting to make me tweak. Or maybe it's just all the instant coffee.  EDIT: EvilCactus sent me a gift card early this morning. Thank you to all who offered to help! Reddit's kindness never ceases to amaze me.
1513	False	a	I have been working odd jobs the past month just to pay off a knee surgery and make rent. I had a day dream about a slice of cheese pizza and ramen just isn't cutting it right now. Will you help out a lonely Fargo girl?
1514	False	a	Stupid student here at the end of exam period has spent all his student loan and would love to have a meal other than tesco own brand noodles (15p gotta love em).  Would really help with  revising for my computer science compiler exam and will pay it forward when I'm working this summer :D Thanks in advance.
1515	False	a	I am almost completely out of food and have a negative balance in my account at present. I am unemployed and my unemployment insurance is expiring.  I could really use a cheering up in the form of a decent meal if anyone is feeling generous.  I would gladly repay the kindness by paying it forward when I get back to work.    If anyone wants more information about my situation or any proof I am able to provide please PM me.  I have a verification system code available as well, please ask if you need it.  Thanks in advance to anyone considering helping me out.
1516	True	a	I am packing up the belongings of the house I grew up in, before I turn the keys over to the bank. I am prepping my cat for a week and a half of boarding, so that he has somewhere to stay, while I couchsurf and scramble to find a job. I spent the last of my unemployment today hiring a U-Haul and I'm down to leftovers. I could really use some comfort food right about now, with the added bonus of having something for breakfast in the morning.  Edit: I will more than happily repay this kindness if/when I get back on my feet.
1517	True	a	School is back up. Just getting over being sick, with whatever public school kids are brewing this year. Going to be a rainy week. Finally getting my daughter back again for a little bit after a long week at her moms. Already have some movies picked out. Was thinking of throwing a little pizza party for her. We can try to repay with artwork, pictures of our cat -- (he is stunning), and/or good deeds.   Daughter has been getting on here now that she reads pretty well, and was going to post from her account but it's less than a month and was too new. Even though she mostly just likes to get on here and upvote pictures from /r/owls. She's loving karma, but... Getting pizza'd on here would totally blow her mind. Personally, I could use seeing something nice from the world. Anyway, many thanks to any kind strangers that might come our way.
1518	False	a	I'm in the middle of moving and have one more day before finals week starts. It's safe to say I'm going a little stir crazy. But mostly I would just really love a simple old pepperoni pizza. I've responded to a few offers and haven't had any responses. I PROMISE to pay it forward when I get moved in back home! Any one want to help a girl out? I would be forever in your debt! I cannot tell you how much it would mean to me.
1519	False	a	I broke my leg a couple years ago and lost my job because of it.  I've, thus far, been unsuccessful in my search for employment.  Workers comp ran out in Februaury, and it's been very tight these last few months.  My wife works really hard as a teacher for troubled kids.  She loves pizza, but we just can't afford it right now, so does anyone want to help me treat a very special woman?
1520	False	a	Hey all,   I come on here not really expecting anything but thought it might be worth a shot. I am currently so broke that there is no food in my house and I am at work for nine hours today with no food. I would kill for a pizza. If you want to help me out, let me know. :) 
1521	False	a	I have no where else to turn. My husband lost his job and I work part-time at the local Walmart stocking shelves. My check doesn't even cover our rent, I have our utilities paid and have spoken to the landlord. I am eligible to go back to the food pantry on Friday. (You can only go once a month) so I just need something to hold us(my two children, my husband, and myself) until Friday, and the kids get free breakfast and lunch at school. So I really just need enough for two dinners. I can repay when money comes in or whatever you like. Thank you for taking time to read my plea.
1522	False	a	About a week left before finals, gonna be up all night editing a paper for tomorrow morning and going into the kitchen just makes me sad. I get my school money in April and I promise to pay pizza forward as soon as I can. 
1523	False	a	Just a friend looking for a bite to eat and wear a smile for the rest of the day. I live in Canada if that's also needed!
1524	True	a	I'm a full time student that also works full time, which means I never get time off! I'm enjoying the first day off I've had in over 3 months, but I have no food in the fridge and I don't get paid til wed! I'd be so grateful for a pizza right now &lt;3&lt;3
1525	False	a	"Hey Guys,  My Parents have had a terrible week, and while I would normally buy them dinner at a time like this I'm between paycheques and out of cash.  This week my dad lost his job of 12 years, on top of that yesterday our family Dog passed away (14 years old, so not totally unexpected). They are just really in the ""World against us"" point of view. They could really use some love from the world at large, and that is where I was hoping ROAP might come in.  If you guys could find a way to send them some saucy cheesy goodness that would be amazing, and come next friday (Payday) I will be passing it on.  Thanks guys!"
1526	False	a	Hi all. First time requesting here. No sob story, nothing like that. I'm just a hungry college gal in want of pizza. If you take the time to send me one I'd be so grateful!
1527	True	a	I get paid Thursday night, I'm down to a pack of Ramen.   Not making first payroll sucks. 
1528	False	a	So I'm completely broke at this point, just a bag of rice left until the end of the month. Pizza is a huge treat, but realistically- does anyone know of a food bank (or similar place) in Montreal?  Thanks :)
1529	False	a	I am broke untill thursday and I have nothing to eat. I just finished my last can of beans and I am on the computer at the library typing this. A pizza would really help me out. Thanks, Michael
1530	True	a	My boyfriend, roommate, and I moved into an apartment getting away from our old lives hoping to start a new.  My boyfriend has a felony but the apartment manager was willing to overlook that and let us move in.  Now because another resident found out what he has a felony for and reported it to the corporate office we now have to be out on the 31st.  We've been here less than a month.  With bills getting in the way we have no money for food.  I made the last of our food last night.  I know it is not much but but I have read some of the amazing posts of people finding the kindness in their hearts to give.  When we are forced to move we may not even have a place to go but that's really not the point of this is it?  Anyway I know a pizza won't feed us until the end of the month however it will help.  Any help at all is much appreciated thank you for taking the time to read this!  Edit:  I forgot to put a location I am in Austin Texas thanks Matt_and_Chelle for the reply to remind me!
1531	False	a	Howdy everyone,  The water heater in our house and the air compressor died in our truck, stealing money away from our grocery funds. If anyone could be so kind to buy us a pizza so my wife and I can eat something other than top ramen and corn, it would be appreciated so much. We aren't picky, just hungry, cheese or pepperoni would be fine. I can write a Haiku for the wonderful person who feeds us!
1532	False	a	Hey, reckon I'd try this. Just looking for my pizza angel! Been running on minimum wage for a while, and really craving some pizza that I can't afford. Promise to pay it forward as soon as I can.  I'm in Murfreesboro, TN. :]
1533	False	a	My friend and I's flight was canceled, and then delayed we're stuck here intill 7:30 PM and won't get to our final destination till 10. We've been here since 8:00AM. The airport is super tiny, there isn't any place to grab food. A pizza would be super clutch right now!   our flight has been delayed again, and we're still hungry, please! edit: pics for proof http://imgur.com/a/hCcaq
1534	False	a	I'm kinda sick, or I'd go out and grab something myself. As is I don't really **need** pizza, but it is a deliciously warm meal that would fill my stomach with delight while I try to grasp the concepts of partial derivatives and such.
1535	True	a	I quit my job because my boss told me I needed to dress more provocatively and wear more makeup to get more tips. I super want a pizza but I am out of money and I'm not having any luck finding a job. I'll draw a picture of whatever if you buy me a pizza :)  [I never said I was an artist](http://i.imgur.com/H03cf.jpg)
1536	False	a	Two of my four kids play sports and  on two nights of the week they both have practices at the same time in different towns. My husband takes one to Soccer and I take the other to Softball. After that we head home for a fast dinner before baths and bed. Tomorrow night it's suppose to be bean and cheese burritos as we are trying to stretch our food budget, not my favorite thing. A pizza would sure be great but cash is low until next payday. Would love to find a pizza hero for the night. We have lots of choices nearby, Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Johns and Round Table. Thanks! D in Cali!  http://contributor.yahoo.com/user/124589/danielle_crofford_fetters.html This is who I am&lt;/a? Can't post a picture right now cause h and I had our  cell phones turned off to save money for a couple of months. 
1537	False	a	studying for several hours for Environmental Geochemistry tonight Invertebrate Zoology tomorrow night and Geographic information systems Thursday night   we are all poor college students (depending on the time between 3-6 of us) anything would be amazing.   i brought Reddit joy once with this post http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/m659k/so_i_was_at_the_gym_and_i_was_thinking/ which made it to the front page, i would be awesome if we got pizza. 
1538	True	a	I'm supporting myself okay, and got a part-time job recently, but I haven't been getting enough hours so my food budget has been grim (think basic chicken + rice, pasta, sandwiches). I won't get my financial aid until next month, and most of this summer I've spent working/trying to make rent.   Could definitely use a pick me-up pizza tonight if someone is willing to help.   Edit: this is my first post on this subreddit, so please correct me if I need to add any info/etc.
1539	True	a	I have ~20 bucks on me since I sent the rent check off yesterday, and I hate asking my parents for cash when I get paid from my job on the 15th. I'm at work now (on campus job) and don't really want to eat Pop Tarts for dinner. There's a Dominos next to campus that always has cheap student specials, but I want to try and make my 20 dollars last as long as possible simply because I don't want to ask for bailout from my parents (trying to actually be an adult and make a living for myself.)  It's okay if you guys want to give to someone more needy! I just kinda thought I'd try and see if this struck with anyone familiar with the situation! Best of luck to everyone out there!
1540	False	a	"My bills this month stretched me a bit thin because I had to get some stuff on my car fixed up. My next payday isn't till Tuesday, so I have been getting really ""Creative"" with my basic ingredients I have left (corn and chicken broth macaroni noodle soup anyone?). I would love for someone to get me a Pizza. I'm not picky. Just something with Pepperoni. I will pay it all kinds of forward on Tuesday. And until then, I will write my champion a Poem dedicated to thier awesomeness."
1541	True	a	Hey all. I'm a nineteen year old college student, home for summer break and at home in New Jersey for fathers day with my two younger brothers. My mom drew short straws and is working on this Sunday/holiday, and my dad doesn't live with us anymore.  The house is almost bare and my mom won't be back until late evening, so I was wondering if there were any redditors out there willing to help my brothers and I out with a pizza for lunch/dinner to give this drab Sunday of ours a defining, yummy meal.  Thanks for reading! and have a great father's day all.
1542	False	a	He's always looked out for me and I would like to return the favor. He came home as a surprise to us which is great, but i can't celebrate because my girlfriend, son, and myself are going to be moving to a new apartment next month so we're on a very tight budget. We live near Pizza Hut and Domino's. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you.  I would be more than willing to provide proof in any way possible.
1543	False	a	Hardworking canvassers for Clean Water Action are in need of morale boosting pizza to help make the world a cleaner, safer place.  You can probably understand how hard it is to be a non-profit in our current economy. Any help to improve the effectiveness of our canvassers is appreciated.  Thanks from the canvassers and the Earth
1544	True	a	We are located in Pensacola, FL. Paid off a lot of bills, debt with the last pay check and also didn't want to have to move a bunch of food with us. We underestimated how long our food would last. We have some noodles and jello and non-perishables left but we'd love some pizza!   We'll try to pay it forward once we get settled in our new home. Thanks! 
1545	False	a	My husband and I are trying to live on $674 a month disability and $81 a month food stamps.  Needless to say, we don't eat out and a pizza would be nice. thanks
1546	False	a	I am super embarrassed but I wouldn't mind some pizza. I will pay it forward when my check gets here in the mail!  
1547	False	a	Our landlord is trying to evict us. The electric company just stopped by to let us know we owe them money, too. We've been at the welfare office every day for the last week, trying to get things going. I will definetly pay it forward when I can.
1548	False	a	Hiya Reddit! It's my wife's birthday today and I was hoping someone would be willing to part with a pizza to help her cope with being.... MID-20s (gasp, horror)
1549	False	a	We didn't have a formal dinner tonight and I'm not really up for making something. I play League of Legends and have plenty of RP so if someone wants, PM me your League of Legends account info and I will PM you back my address. Once I receive my pizza, you'll get the skin or champ of you choice. Sound good?   Edit: Offer stands til' 9:30 my time. I gotta get off my ass and eat sometime if I don't get no offahs.
1550	False	a	tomorrow, my wife and i are going before a judge to let him decide if our bankrupcy case is valid. we've had a really tough time of things through this, but tomorrow is the light at the end of the tunnel.  we would love to have a pizza dinner just to ourselves to get our spirits up and ready for the fight we'll have tomorrow.  thanks to all who read this.
1551	True	a	I present a humble situation where one brave soul could prove their honor.  Unfortuantely, I am getting laid off in 2 days, sucks, I know, but thats not the worst of it.  My girlfriend and I went grocery shopping recently, using the very last of our food stamps. During our trip, we put all our groceries in the car (which we use twice a month to go get groceries, can't afford to drive more than that.) Once we got home we realized after a couple hours that the only item we left in the cart, was our pizza.  I called the store and they said that unless someone brought it in and reported it, we wouldn't be able to get our pizza.  Sadly, nobody reported it.  We really really wanted that pizza! So as I did an inadvertant RAoP, I'm hoping that a generous redditer will bestow upon us a delicious pizza pie!  I have verification code! Want to make our night?
1552	True	a	Our power is out, my other 3 roommates have family in the area to stay with except for me.  I have no way to cook and can't afford to go to a restaurant until I get paid. please help if you can! 
1553	False	a	I play music! Unfortunately that does not necessarily pay the bills or keep me fed. Here's me playing guitar: https://soundcloud.com/will-james-guitar  I hope one of you beautiful people out there could spot me some Papa John's? When I get a real job I'll be sure to come back and pay it forward :)
1554	True	a	"Hey guys,  I don't get the next installment of my student loan until next month and I'm working on an essay about ""if"" tonight and would love a pizza as brain food. I will promise to pay it forward next month when I get paid, you can even chase me up on it if you like!"
1555	False	a	My paycheck is late, as HR for my company is in NYC and still out of power. Won't come through for a few more days. I have enough ramen and cereal in the house to last me, but something hot and greasy would make my night. Thanks Reddit - I'll pay this forward as soon as the check clears!
1556	False	a	Lost my job on Monday and after my beginning of month bills were paid I'm completely broke until Friday when my final paycheck will come in.  Omaha, NE, there is a Pizza Hut and a Godfather's Pizza nearby that deliver. I believe there should also probably be a Papa Johns as well somewhere nearby that would deliver here.
1557	True	a	Dominoes &gt; Pizza Hut &lt; Papa Johns  Also, we are from Rexburg, Idaho. And no, we don't put potatoes on our pizza...
1558	True	a	Keeping an eye on them all is a chore, help with dinner tonight would be greatly appreciated! I'll be sure to pay-it-forward when I can.
1559	True	a	Hiya.  I needed a new place to live as of August 1st and have just paid my first/last and security deposit on it. I, unfortunately, don't get paid until Tuesday the 31st, and am down to 5 packages of ramen, and a jar of raspberry jam (and coffee).  Let's be friends? I'll buy you one next month. :D
1560	True	a	My name is Liz. I'm 22 and stuck in my food barren apartment with nothing but an empty wallet and a frown. I would sincerely appreciate any help in filling my tummy with some cheesy goodness. I wish I had a sad story to tell but to be honest I was at the Philadelphia Folk Festival for the weekend and stupidly spent all my money, forgetting that my cabinets were empty back at home. Now I'm sitting here, tummy grumblin, on the verge of a headache, hoping to God that someone will show me alittle empathy. Thank you for your time and good day.  EDIT: around the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area.
1561	False	a	Hey. Ive read the whole side bar and [this website](http://www.randomactsofpizza.com/index.html). As a Redditor for well over 3 years, Ive known about this community for a long time but this is the first time Ive ever posted here. Before I continue, I just want everyone to know that this isnt my usual reddit account, its a throwaway, as my friends know my other account and I wouldnt want them to see this post. But I would have no problem verifying my usual reddit account with any potential pizza givers. I also have a verification number from the RAOP website.  Anyway, I just woke up. Its 4 am in Ontario, and I dont think many pizza places are open until around 11 am. Me and my two siblings dont really have much here to eat. Im 22 by the way. My siblings are 18 and 17.  And I have about 14 dollars cash, I was just going to buy a some pasta, hamburger, some cans of soup, and a couple boxes of kraft dinner for the weekend. But it'd be nice to have a pizza to eat around lunch today.  Im not sure if I should be posting this now, or later when its a more appropriate time.  Anyway thanks again.
1562	False	a	Barely made it on time to work today, hit the off button on the alarm. So I can usually make it through the day without lunch if I had breakfast but I didn't get to munch on that either. 
1563	True	a	My obsession with pizza actually scares people. This would be the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.  
1564	False	a	I haven't had more than 10 dollars in my bank account for the past month. I'm in college and my boyfriend has been paying for my food since october. I just want to do something nice for him and buy him a pizza :) I can show a picture of my bank account if necessary 
1565	False	a	I've had a rough year, and am currently at a job where my boss criticizes me left and right because I'm not an aggressive enough salesperson, so I'm using all my resources to find other employment. I'm just a quiet person, and respect people too much to manipulate them into buying something. I know I hate it when it's done to me, so I couldn't do it to another person.  So I'm requesting a pizza to help relax and just unwind for the first time in this year. I absolutely intend to pizza it forward on payday.  Thank you.
1566	False	a	my necessary things like internet and good food are all gone all i have in the fridge is a single yogurt and some sauces, would help alot if anyone can grace me with a pizza.  I'm from Bath UK
1567	False	a	Well, here goes. I'm a 19 year old male student, living with my dad. He left for a hiking trip to Costa Rico. He left me some money to go grocery shopping, which I deposited into my bank account. Unfortunately, I lost my wallet 3 days ago, which had my debit card in it, and can not go grocery shopping. I contacted my bank the day after I lost my wallet, and they said that my new one should arrive in the mail on Monday. I have eaten all of the edible food in my house, and am now kinda stuck. If there are any kind souls out there that can help, I will gladly pay it forward ASAP.
1568	False	a	We are a group of five local community college kids in Modesto CA, gathering to play some retro games (NES and SNES) and we are all dying for a change of ramen. Would anyone be kind enough to help us out? Some pie sounds fantastic (when doesn't it?)  Thanks for reading.  FSM bless.
1569	False	a	Really really hungry and broke.
1570	False	a	I doubt anyone will send. But if you do, I'd be happy to take pics of me enjoying the pizza. I like Italian sausage and bacon.
1571	True	a	I only just realized Halloween was my cake day so I've never celebrated it before. Anybody want to send some celebration toward Washington state?   Edit: Ryzome has PM'd me with an offer. I'll update soon with a thank you post once it arrives. 
1572	False	a	Parents have been out of town for 5 days, left me meager supplies which i've gone through, and no money to get more food. So I could use some delicious pizza courtesy of reddit.  
1573	False	a	Hey there. I just found this subreddit yesterday. I don't have any money on my debit card right now, but I have cash. If someone wants to help me get a pizza here, I'll make sure the driver gets a $20 tip. Pm me!
1574	False	a	Well,   I have been broke for the past month or so and have been sustaining myself on a diet of Chef Boyardee and Hot Pockets. I do still have a can of Chef Boyardee left, but it's stomach churning just to look at. I'd just really like a hot (not microwaved) meal.   The good news is that I will be getting some money tomorrow, and will be happy to, at the discretion of the pizza donor:   1) Pay it forward with another pizza gift on this here subreddit OR;  2) Send my donor a fully functioning, used, Xbox 360 hard drive (20gb).   Verification provided upon request. Thanks!
1575	False	a	Background: Health insurance got cancelled because left old job, new job didn't start for a while, started in that magical time frame that allowed me to go way too long without a paycheck and COBRA wants 900 dollars so she can get her shots to continue to finish her education.   So, I'd really LOVE for her to fill up on a yummy pizza.  If this works, I love the internet. If it doesn't, I still love the internet!  We're just north of Philadelphia, PA  
1576	True	a	I'm a 21 year old college student who lives in Brooklyn, NY.  I'm currently broke and all my relatives are away till Sunday. All I have left is a bit of rice and kielbasa. Probably enough for the rest of today, but I don't know what I'm going to eat tomorrow.  My relatives are in a bit of a bind due to credit issues, so in general we are usually tight on money.  I'm starting work training for my new job next week (worried about talking about it due to NDA issues - similar to another post on Reddit that caused lots of issues for the guy who posted it).  If I could get just a pizza, even plain, the smallest size, it would be nice.  **EDIT** - Thank you [bearvivant](http://www.reddit.com/user/bearvivant) for providing me with a pizza in this time where I'm really down to little! I hope to offer pizza to someone in the future once I get this upcoming job.
1577	False	a	I will answer any questions you have.
1578	False	a	Basically, a year ago I bought a computer using a credit card offered with a 0% introductory APR for a year. Buried in the fine print was a line explaining that I would be charged 22.9% interest on my initial purchase if I didn't pay in full after 12 months. I didn't realize that bit until yesterday, the one-year anniversary of my purchase (I posted a whole thread about the episode elsewhere). The result - a surprise $500 charge to my card.  And of course all of this happened when my payment plan failed as a result of my financial aid being literally obliterated this year. The state decided to take my grant offers away.  So that was just really rough. I feel awful and scared and screwed and I have no idea how I'm going to to get out of this debt any time soon. Doesn't help that I was planning to go to grad school next year. No idea how that will work out now.  So I'd like some pizza to dull the pain. It would literally mean an absolute ton to me right now. Thank you for reading this.   Edit: I'm in Chico, CA.
1579	False	a	Hey all. its about 4 in the afternoon here and i have yet to get any food into my stomach. There are a couple mismatched things in my pantry (canned green beans mostly), but i would love to have a real, solid meal. Thanks for considering my request!
1580	False	a	I'm in Canada, I had a hard day at work today and I have one coming up tomorrow (PM me and Ill give you details) I have the basics of life but I have no extra money until Thursday. Problem is, I really want a pizza. If anyone is willing to help out I'll pay it forward on payday.
1581	False	a	After having just finished paying two months rent, and my sister's infant getting sick, our family is in a seriously tight bind, cash wise, for the next two weeks. We've had troubles before though and made it through, this just makes it the perfect time to ask for your help in solving the real problem...  After almost a year of trying to convince her otherwise, my mother believes that Reddit is at it's core, a place where people go to lie about how wonderful their life is or post pictures of their animals. (Basically anything told to her about Reddit from watching the news) She doesn't realize that Reddit can be a great source of kindness that can touch even the average user if you seek it from subs such as [/r/depression](/r/depression) , [/r/progresspics](/r/progresspics) and of course [/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza](/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza).  With our recent cash problems, it would go a very long way in making her realize how important Reddit has been to me, along with hopefully making her realize the true nature of the people on this site, if she were to receive a Pizza from a generous stranger during a difficult time.  Thank you in advance! This site and this subreddit are wonderful! 
1582	False	a	The other night the alternator belt slipped off the engine and a coolant pipe burst. The power steering gave out and I had a bit of a workout getting the boat home with a steam cloud drifting behind and the emergency blinkers on. Boom! Scary, but everyone's safe. It does mean that my next pay check is tied up.  Today our 9 month old was sleepy nursing and ended up taking a chunk out of /u/mrsslowloris nipple and now she's feeling a little nursing shy and she'd like a pizza tonight. I do have a picture of the bloody nipple with a chunk missing if you need proof. Thanks!
1583	False	a	GOOD MORNING! I'm bloody starving and don't have anything to eat. A delicious pizza would kick my day off to the best start! In return I will spread your legend far and wide. 
1584	False	a	hey there, i would appreciate it if anybody could help me out with a pizza. i'm broke until payday and after a 15-hour workday i'm too worn out for cooking. love you reddit! 
1585	False	a	Right around the new year, a friend and I both found ourselves unexpectedly and suddenly needing new places to live. Neither one of us was financially able to find a rental on no notice, so instead, we pooled our resources and moved into a seriously crappy hotel off the highway in a rotten part of town that had a weekly rate we could afford.  Fast forward 2 months and the hotel's being renovated by corporate and they've decided to boot everyone with one week's notice. We panic appropriately, pool our cash again, manage to just barely afford a room share that seems like it'll be awesome, but it leaves us flat broke (we have a cup full of pennies; that's it) till Monday. Weeks of ramen are doing us in, and a pizza... mmm... piiiiizza... would let us relax and maybe enjoy the evening instead of sniping at each other and feeling vaguely hungry.   I'd be in a position to pay this forward on Monday--and would. Tonight is just all kinds of suckage.
1586	False	a	I'm a hungry student and would love a meal that costs more than ¬£3! I love pizza, so just thought I'd ask.
1587	False	a	My wife is home with our 20 month old son. We're broke and get paid tomorrow. But this doesnt fix her hunger tonight. Our local pizza places wont deliver if you order online so any order would have to be done by phone. I would greatly appreciate anyone who is able to help tonight. I have 15 bucks in paypal that I can send in return for the ordering and paying for of the pizza. 
1588	False	a	I was going to request a pizza for tonight, I've been in money trouble and waiting on two jobs to call back, but unemployed till then. But I'm a college student and I can still eat reliably so if you looked at this post and considered sending me a pizza, **send it to one of those folks who has people to support!**  **Edit: Okay you guys convinced me, thank you NYGalz! :)**
1589	True	a	So i've been surviving off bread and soup for a few days and have a few more days of that to look forward to. I don't get off work for a few hours though and all my soup is at home. I only have 3 cans left, so I'm hesitant to even eat them.   Would anyone be able to hook up a pizza? Any pizza? I had some M&amp;M's today but even making this request is making me salivate.  Update: In another thread Krayer saw and sent me $7.92 so imma go buy some tuna and cup of noodles. Thank you to anyone who read this post but tonight, I dine on canned fish!  Edit 2: 1369ic hooked it up a lil more so when possible i shall post a picture of my tuna, bread, and other good eats in place of pizza tonight. 
1590	False	a	It's my friends IRL cakeday and he is home alone and he is broke so I'd like to have some thing for us to eat together when I see him today
1591	True	a	Hi, my husband is a US Marine stationed in Camp Pendleton, CA. He left yesterday for a month long training op in preparation for his upcoming deployment to Afghanistan. I am 11 weeks pregnant and only have a package of Easy Mac and a can of soup to last until our pay check comes Friday. Anyone willing to help out would be greatly appreciated!!
1592	False	a	My Birthday is this friday (November 16th) and I'm turning 21! :D I'm extremely excited! I've been browsing Reddit all evening and I randomly got the idea! /r/RandomActsOfPizza was what originally brought me to Reddit for the first time; just the amount of awesomeness involved is unlike anything else I've seen. I've never actually had a good enough reason to post here (other than having the munchies) but now I think I do! It'd make my 21st birthday awesome!
1593	False	a	Living independently for the first time in my life. I would like to celebrate with some pizza.  Tucson, AZ
1594	True	a	GW girls like pizza too...no sob story, just a desire to have some pizza and wings tonight in the Vegas area. :) Special thanks and pics for whomever can help. ;)
1595	True	a	Hey all. Redditor [erenion](http://www.reddit.com/user/erenion), [wedgepiett](http://www.reddit.com/user/wedgepiett), and I are developing a follow up to our [Android app](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.boycottsopa.android) that allows users scan item bar codes and see if they're made by a company that supports SOPA. Our follow up app will allow users to join campaigns and will inform them when they scan an item if it offends any of their campaigns (eg child labor, SOPA, etc). We're in the planning stages now, and are just starting implementation now...and well...we're hungry. We're looking at a few long nights of coding, and pizza helps a ton.   [Hi reddits!](http://i.imgur.com/3L8as.jpg)
1596	False	a	Me and my roommates are broke as a joke, would love a pizza.  Currently trying to stop our hunger by smoking the last of the Shisha.
1597	True	a	EDIT- Fulfilled! Awesomely!  I'm a poor about-to-be-a-premed-student-starting-tomorrow. This is terrifying. Pizza (and maybe a salad, so I don't feel godawful fat. Just a pizza is dandy too) would help calm my nerves. Alas, I have no spare money. So, I am proposing a magnificent trade- I will finish the scarf that I just learned to crochet on (which will be finished in three or four more days), and a drawing of a narwhal, for pizza. Or a penguin, or an abrictosaurus, should you want the picture sent off NOW, because I already have drawings of those. Both are pretty awesome.  [Half-finished scarf](http://i.imgur.com/c1Gax.jpg) (I'm gonna finish the scarf in a lobelia blue, then black, and then maybe repeat a color or two to get it up to 5 feet long. Right now it's just about exactly two feet. Full disclosure, I did learn to crochet right before I started it, so the beginning isn't great. If you're willing to wait a week or two, I can make a new one from scratch that will all be nice. In that case, your options for colors are hunter green, pale blue-gray, a deep slightly reddish purple, lobelia blue, silver gray, and black. I can do stripes, and will do zig-zags but they aren't perfect. Stripes are way better. Anyway. Those are your options. I could totally do a bitchin' Slytherin-esque scarf (no coat of arms), or a black/silver/gray one, or... your options are endless)  [Penguin](http://i.imgur.com/hGWpS.jpg)  [Abrictosaurus](http://i.imgur.com/PDy9R.jpg)
1598	False	a	For those who don't know, AP classes are high school classes that allow the opportunity for college credit at the end.  Tomorrow I have AP Calculus AB, Friday I have AP US History and AP European History, and next Wednesday I have AP English Language and Composition.   I've been studying my ass off and craving some good (or crappy, I'm not really that picky) pizza, and it occurred to me that there's a subreddit just for this! 
1599	False	a	Heyo-  It pains me to write this, on a non-throwaway, no less. I'm really struggling with money right now. I spent Christmas alone (I just moved here and all of my family/friends are 1400 miles away) and am now spending New Year's Eve alone because I can't afford to go out (and... I know no one).   Here's some proof that I am... uh... I guess, a person named Hamburglary? http://imgur.com/efW2d  If you would send a pizza my way for supper I would be FOREVER IN YOUR DEBT. We have a Pizza Butt local to here and that would be juuuust fine (and you can order online etc so that I never need to know your cc info, etc, so on, so forth).   Thanks for reading/thinking about it, and have a great New Year's Eve!
1600	False	a	My siblings and I are hungry for some pizza, we don't go out much and with our parent working all the time we never get to go out to eat much. So please if anyone can give us a pizza that would be awesome.
1601	True	a	Family of 4 would really love a pizza. 
1602	False	a	Hi I am in louisville ky and I am asking for help with a pizza and cheesesticks until tomorrow when I get paid..We are down to nothing in our house right now and we are hungry..Could anyone please help us out please..
1603	False	a	Hey friends- I just moved to a new town to attend graduate school in the fall. I was told by my employer, Walmart, that transferring to a store down here would be no problem at all. As it turns out- the Walmart down here can't find a spot for me for at least a few more weeks. I will get my last paycheck in the mail (from the last Walmart I worked at) late next week, but my funds have dwindled from the move and I haven't been able to afford much more than a box of ramen to keep me full. I just learned that a church across the street from me runs a food pantry, but they're only open on Wednesdays. If a redditor would be kind enough to help me fill my belly this evening, I will gladly return the favor when funds return. Many thanks, Sarah
1604	True	a	"I knew this subreddit existed, but hadn't thought about it lately. I was about to preheat the oven to cook my usual dinner..a dollar tree 1$ ""Celeste"" brand mini pizza and a dollar tree burrito. Thats totally fine, cant complain life is good...but I realized hell its my bday, Im an electrical engineering senior that busts his ass constantly and lives off nothing, no job, just fafsa  (thats long out by now), maybe someone will think I deserve a pizza.    Proof of everything I have said above (plus you could just fb me to verify with all the info available from picture): removed   Edit:Wow I believe in reddit. Thanks and goodnight."
1605	False	a	I run a Auto shop in CT and it's been a really slow few weeks. We've been eating ramen and honey buns all week and would love to pig out on a big greasy cheesy pizza. Can anyone help us out today? Thanks for the love!!!
1606	False	a	My parents just went through a divorce and times have been hard on both my mom and dad. I'm living with my mom now but may have to move to my dads because my mom isn't able to support me and my dad isn't paying child support to my mom. i would love to treat myself to a pizza but i have nearly any money to pay for one, please help me with paying for a pizza! i will return the favor once i am able to!
1607	False	a	We just had a car accident and are now without a car. Reduced pay checks just dont seem to be cutting it either. Pizza would be a nice change for dinner one night.          Fort Worth, Texas 
1608	False	a	     My girlfriend and I are both in college, and we're having issues coming up with rent this month, which in turn means we have no food in our pantry.  I have a Mid-Term I'm currently studying for tonight, and she has been having issues finding a job in our small town for two months now.  We're located in Flagstaff AZ       We'll do just about anything for savory, delicious pizza, so be creative and have fun with us... we're yours for a price!
1609	False	a	I've been stuck at home unable to go to work for the past few days because I've been.without gas money and no one to carpool with and little money for food til my next paycheck on Tuesday. I would even be willing to repay the deed once I get my paycheck, but am Shit out of luck currently.
1610	False	a	Throwaway bc this is embarrassing. Ben off work for a few weeks (injury, still have a job just can't work until i'm better), no money until end of jan (screw u ei) and bank account pretty empty. My roommate has been awesome about groceries but he had to leave town a couple days ago bc of a funeral. Fridge &amp; cupboards basically empty.  So anyone feel like sending me some pizza? 
1611	False	a	I am currently in the process of a move and have exhausted all of my funds in terms of truck, movers, etc.  I need my energy for tomorrow, and the rice I have isn't going to cut it (plus, my pots and pans are packed!).  I should be fine financially in a couple (2-3) weeks once my pay check kicks in, and I will pay it forward, as that's the right thing to do.  Can anyone PM me a gift card for $15-20?  
1612	False	a	My girlfriend and I are college students, we manage to pay our few bills by donating plasma at a local Biolife, unfortunately after our internet and cellular bills we are left with a very small amount of money to live off of and most of that money gets put toward gas to get us back and forth to our school, as well as toward dog food.   At this point my bank account is overdrawn, I have my computer on craigslist to get a few extra bucks from (im an IT major), and we are struggling to get by.    I know this is a long shot but all I ask for is a pizza so that we can eat something other than noodles for the first time in almost a week. IF any one would be willing to help out I would be so grateful.  The only problem is that it would have to be an in-store pickup, not delivery, because we live outside of the range of any of the major delivery shops.         
1613	False	a	So on the 6th it is my birthday. I am posting this now so that more people get to see it, If anyone would send me a pizza on my birthday shoot me a PM and I will be eternally grateful. No sob story or anything. I just enjoy pizza. Thanks.
1614	False	a	Just what the title says. Low on cash, unscheduled from my job, and my girlfriend left me, all within a couple weeks of one another. I've been struggling through job and internship applications, and trying to keep my head up, but it's not going great. My sleep and eating schedules have taken a dive as a result. Not to speak of my mood, most of the time. I'm not starving or anything, but it's a pretty rough situation.  If any kindly redditor would be willing to send a pizza my way (it'd be dinner tonight and lunch tomorrow), I'd be very grateful, and promise to pay it forward the moment I can afford to do so. If not, that's okay - someone on here probably needs it more than me.
1615	False	a	Hello RAOP!  As the title says our company's contract was terminated on Monday leaving me without work.  I did not eat all day yesterday as I've been too busy.  I have never tried this before but I have a craving for some pizza and thought I would give it a shot.   Looking forward to paying it forward once I land another job.  That's part of the fun.   Well, anyway, thanks for listening to my story.
1616	False	a	I'm home from college for the summer and my parents are gone for the weekend. Unfortunately, my LCD screen failed on my toshiba laptop and after shipping it to them, they've told me that I owe them $200 for fixing the POWER JACK before they'll fix my screen despite the fact that it's under warranty and that I didn't send it in for them to fix anything but the screen. After arguing with them over a span of two days and looking at other options, I gave in and am now broke. I've eaten ramen for virtually every meal for the past 2 and a half days and I can't do it anymore. It would be sweet if a fellow redditor could help a guy out.
1617	True	a	I am so hungry, me and my roommate have had only saltine crackers to eat for like the last 2 days, we spend all our money on our bills :(  the groceries are the last thing to stock for the sake of everyone always coming to our place to eat our food. Everything has been really short lately and it just sucks! , If you could help out in any way that would be amazing. It would be very filling and a great surprise for my roommate...I would pay it forward in due time to someone else in need.  thank you, &lt;3  here is me, starving : http://i.imgur.com/GYmNY.jpg 
1618	False	a	My hours at work got cut which has put me into a financial bind. I'm looking for other work, but right now I don't have a lot of money. On top of that, I recently found out my grandpa's health is deteriorating, which just adds to the stress of everything. I'm just one 22 year old guy, but I'm really tired and stressed out, and could use some delicious pizza to temporarily ease my woes. I have some strong job prospects coming up, and as soon as my money isn't so tight, I will absolutely pay it forward. 
1619	True	a	First, i want to say WOW! I had no idea something like this existed. I've helped people on the street with meals before but this is something beautifully different.   I am a young woman living with my longtime boyfriend and like a lot of people, times are tough. I had a temporary lay off with my job that i just went back to but wont be receiving a paycheck until next Friday. My boyfriend wont be paid from his work until the 6th. Had dental work done recently that took about 190 bucks to fix my teeth. I used my last can of chili beans and mixed it with white rice last night for dinner. Many nights we go without dinner(sometimes i survive on cups of coffee all day) but we never lose sight that things will get better for us eventually. We are in the middle class rut; don't make enough to survive comfortably in California but are making too much money for food assistance. It leaved us caught in a limbo. Ive been to a local food pantry once before and yes, it was hard to keep your chin up and have that pride when you are asking for help from someone.   It seems easier to ask for help if its done semi-anonymously as I don't have to shamefully look anyone in the eye who may judge me. I would love a pizza for dinner and with the leftovers, eat for breakfast and lunch. We live in Union City, California in the shadows of both the great Silicon Valley and the San Fransisco Bay. Right smack in the middle where apartments are tiny but cost you an arm and a leg to live there.   Thank you guys for taking the time to create such a wonderful service to help your fellow man. I WILL be paying it forward when i get on my feet, if only a simple pie to a struggling family.   email me at l0serl0ve7@gmail.com if you could help us. If you need proof of something lemme know, i can screenshot my dentist check that cleared or my negative account balance. Thanks again.   -Leilani Love
1620	False	a	My car didn't JUST break down, it's getting repaired at the shop, haven't had it for 3 days. haven't been able to get groceries and me and my fiance cleared everything out quicker than expected. We knew we would be riding it slim this month due to the car repair, so we figured we'd give this a shot! Pics, signs, etc available uppon request ;)! Also, we'll happily return the favor to RAOP within 7 days !  Forgot to add - Orlando, Florida is the area, zip 32839.  &lt;3 Ash + Dom
1621	True	a	[Received]   Big THANKS to katzmcn 
1622	False	a	Big economy issues. I haven't eaten more than a couple nectarines since Thursday, and there's not much to eat in this house. I've got three little siblings with mental disabilities whom I would like to feed before myself, so...anything edible usually goes to them first. Anyway, yep, if you need any more info I can provide it.
1623	True	a	My boyfriend and I are on pretty tight times at the moment, and have basically been living off hot dogs and Ramen for a bit now. I personally would like to make the food I have last as long as possible, and I'd love to surprise him with something good, since he just found out his hours have been cut. Anything would be appreciated, but if you're feeling super nice, his favorite is Papa Johns!
1624	False	a	just feeling some pizza, if you can, awesome.. if not well-- i appreciate the kindness of all others anyways!
1625	True	a	First off, I will admit I am new, and I made my account after discovering this subreddit.  But I have been a lurker for quite a while and have even gotten my mum addicted to this site (and the aww sub).   Right now I have no gas, and that in itself is nothing new.  But I also have no food, or cash.  I'm not really a fan of spilling my life story.  I don't think it's fair to people, especially if they think I'm only after pity.  But I will explain some, at least that's connected to why I'm in this situation.  Otherwise, what's the point?   My baby sister died when she was barely out of her teens.  I was still a teen myself at the time, and my mum took it very badly.  I ended up becoming her carer and after about five years of constantly hiding anything sharp or pill related and just generally taking care of her, I kind of snapped (or broke. However you want to put it).  It's now eleven years later and the depression pretty much controls my life.   I do get enough money to pay most of my bills.  Though gas and shopping are the lowest priorities.  I have gas/electric here, so thankfully the gas doesn't heat the water for the shower.   I'm not the type of person that can put off paying the bills in order to buy groceries.  Even though sometimes I really should.  That's just the way I was raised.  Sucky, yes, but at least I have the internet and tv to keep me from going insane.    I don't know what kind of proof you could ask for about me.  But please feel free to ask away and I will try my best to verify anything.  Unless you want a picture of me.  That's just wrong.  And evil.  And....wrong :)  Edit: Forgot to include [request] doh
1626	True	a	Me and my girlfriend recently moved across the country. Turns out the job I had was a scam, and I never got paid. Tonight is our last night in the hotel room and we are beyond broke. We could really use a pizza while we try to figure out what is next for us. Staying in the Los Angeles area. 
1627	True	a	OP WILL deliver with pics v√≠a PM. 
1628	True	a	Us + our two children. A family member who is usually here is in the hospital and the last few days have been hard for everyone. There is really no food to speak of and we won't be able to get anything until the 24th.   Full disclaimer, someone did get us a couple of pizzas 17 days ago. I feel like I should be honest about this being another request after a somewhat recent one from us. But we are stuck in such a bad situation this month, we called food banks to see if any of them could drop off some food for us (but none will deliver, even if you have no transportation, which we don't) and with $1.51 to our name right now, this is all I could think of.   Thank you for reading and considering our request. We very much hope to be on the giving end of things someday.
1629	False	a	I just paid my rent/utilities today.. which was all of my money. so now I am completely broke until next friday when I get paid
1630	True	a	I'm having a bad week, struggling with money and pizza could make it all go away... I would be extremely thankful :)
1631	True	a	"Hey y'all.  I'm a video producer in Chicago and my biggest client yet decided he wanted to use the work I gave him and not pay for it.  I've spent ALL day today and yesterday looking for work just so I can put some food in my refrigerator.  Rent and utilities are covered, but I haven't had a ""real"" meal in over a week.  Dominos sounds so incredibly good right now for my belly and attitude towards the human race.    Anyway, I am willing to make some motion graphics or logo designs.  I will work for my pie!  Peace."
1632	True	a	My boyfriend and I were living in Chicago while I was attending school, I have just graduated and will be moving to a more affordable residence on Thursday but until then all of our money is currently tied up in application fees, deposits and rent. Anything would make this rather bleak night infinitely better and will be payed forward as soon as we are able.  A preview of our fridge [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/3VWPHfj)  And a picture of our buddy toby who would absolutely love you forever for a piece of sausage [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/JDUIIQg)
1633	False	a	My boss who I came here with has gone to visit friends and I have no transportation except walking. Was hoping RAoP could help a brother out with a pizza for one. I would of course tip the driver. (with my money not yours lol)
1634	False	a	So I'm sitting in the living room of a lady friend of mine shortly after we have watched the movie Bad Teacher.  We are hungry, but sadly, shortly before I arrived for the movie, the contents of her refridgerator was removed for a little bit of maintnence and de-icing.  The dumpster is full of lost dreams of dinner, that sadly spoiled.  Anyways... I introduced this girl to Reddit tonight, and we happen to be hungry.  After about an hour of laughing our asses off at her reddit innocence, I remembered Random acts of Pizza. We want her first time to be unforgetable and satisfactory. THANKS!
1635	True	a	Orange County, CA. This is *random* acts of pizza not *charitable* acts of pizza, so I suppose it's worth a shot. A pizza tonight would make me insanely happy. I'm drooling over thoughts of gooey cheese... mmmm :)
1636	False	a	"I commute two hours everyday and left my wallet at home. Simple as that. I will for sure be ""paying it forward"" as soon as can if I am blessed with some pizza. I have a long day ahead of me and am self employed so I hope that someone will be kind enough to za me. "
1637	True	a	Anyone else ever had Pizza Ranch? Delicious pies, for real. If anyone would be kind enough to help out a college student with some Pizza Ranch for dinner, it would be so appreciated. Either way, thanks!  **EDIT** I know they do online gift cards. Again, either way, thanks for reading!
1638	False	a	"Hi thanks for reading our post.  We are a ""combined"" family of 6 in Hemet.  My husband has 3 children ages 15, 11, and 8. I have my 14 year old son.  We are raising the 4 of them without any help (physical, mental or financial) from the other parents.  We have had to close down our Small Business this year due to the economy and for the first time have had to go on public assistance.  We are struggling to find gainful employment for my husband, but so far have had no luck.  I would be willing to go back to work immediately, however I will be having lung surgery in the near future to find out if I have cancer.  It seems like with the summer here we should be having some kind of fun with our kiddos, but we are not able to afford to take them anywhere so we have made ""movie"" night and ""game"" night at home......a pizza would make it a wonderful night....a much needed wonderful night.  Thank you for reading."
1639	False	a	I have been on /r/RandomActsofPizza, and I always liked the idea but I was too scared. Now I would like to try this for real, but I am starting off by requesting a pizza. I am a simple pepperoni type person, but I love trying new things.   This isn't a sob story of any kind, I just want a pizza. If you'd like, I am in the Orange County **~*area*.**  I would love to pay this forward to someone some time. The idea of RAoP is awesome; giving the present of ooey-gooey-pizza goodness is amazing.   I hope to get a Redditor who expands my tastes!   *P.S. I never had anchovies. I love all meats. Cheese? Please! Lots.*
1640	False	a	It's 10/30, posted this up yesterday, seems I'm pretty popular on here. Have not got any help yet and would still like a pizza if anyone willing to spare me some.  I'm not exactly a charity case (at least not yet) but I was planning on using that $50 for food, now it's going to a stinking overdraft fee instead. I work part time at a local church doing clean ups every Tuesday and Friday. It's not my main job but it helps out a whole lot. The problem is they pay me with these checks that are uncashable, they have to be deposited into an account. I have an ebanking account with Bank of America, every time I deposit a check I get charged a service fee at the end of the month. Well, guess what hit my bank last night? A couple service fees and an overdraft fee for good measure, just wonderful. So my account went from a positive few cents yesterday to negative $56 dollars today. Even when I put in my check I'll be overdrawn anyway, and if I can't come up with the difference they'll hit me for another $35 in a couple days.  They told me that overdraft protection would stop this kind of thing, but of coarse it doesn't do a thing against their fees so getting them removed isn't happening. I'm just glad I filled up my car the other night or I wouldn't have wheels next week. I get paid next Friday and thankfully my Mom is gonna send me some money in a couple days but I'm empty stomached between now and then. Would anybody mind tossing a pizza and some soda my way to tide me over? You'd earn a spot in my prayers tomorrow for sure. I'm just tired of life dumping on me, so if anyone would cut me a break I'd love you forever.
1641	True	a	"I really hate asking for handouts and if I wasn't married, I probably wouldn't bother. But yesterday, I got laid off. Not only did I not get any severance pay, my boss also gave me a 1-week, mandatory, unpaid ""vacation"" prior to the layoff.   They had told me to ""enjoy a week off for Thanksgiving and spend time with your family."" That was nice, I figured my Christmas bonus will make up for the 40-hour loss. Then I come back ready to work, 2 days later I get the boot. Keep in mind, this is 2 weeks before Christmas bonuses go out.   So I lost 1 week of pay, no severance, no bonus, and no job. My wife is a full-time college student that isn't even allowed to work (she will lose her scholarships.)  This is going to be a very tight and hungry Christmas for my wife and I. And we would greatly appreciate something good to eat so I can use what money I have left to pay bills until I find another job.  If you need proof, I'd be happy to tell you anything. We are a very generous couple and once I get another job, I would be happy to pay it forward.   Located in Eugene, Oregon  Thanks Reddit  **Edit: Thank you very much twister17 for your very generous gift! I will post pics when we get hungry. :)**"
1642	True	a	I wouldn't normally be asking random people for help because I dont like asking for things but im in a tough spot right now. I was an explosive specialist from 2002-2006 (2006-2008 Inactive Reserves) I now work in security (im at work now) I dont make alot of money even with a college degree, I dont get paid until friday I have no lunch and no dinner (well I have 3 boxes of mac n cheese at home) I litterally have 3 boxes of mac n cheese 1 package of hot dogs and 3 cans of sphagetti o's to last until friday...so if anyone could help and get me something to eat and maybe take home to my wife and two kids I would greatly appreiciate it. I have proof of serive if you want it.
1643	False	a	Spokane Washington is lustful for a wonderful pizza, I don't care about about the size, gender, or ethnic origin of this pizza, so long as it has sauce. No payday till friday, and man, I'm freaking salivating right now looking at all these stupid pizza ads I get in the mail...
1644	True	a	I'm a twenty year old who is taking time off from school, and just recently started working at a drugstore. I'm still a week away from getting my first paycheck, after being unemployed for two months, and I have $1.77 to my name after paying for rent. I would be greatly appreciative of even a small pizza, because I haven't eaten since Sunday. I'm sure this is a longshot because not many people are willing to spend that money, and I understand that completely. If out of some miracle the pizza angels are smiling upon me today I will gladly repay the favor as soon as I get my paycheck. I suppose it's also a significant fact that I'm vegetarian.
1645	False	a	im working at a factory and we all havnt eaten yet today all hungry and payday isn't until tomorrow.....we are here for another 7 hours please someone feed us
1646	True	a	my family and i have no food for tonight i was wondering if anyone would be willing to offer
1647	True	a	"Been having a very rough time with a few surprise expenses and I have incoming income but it won't be here for about a week. I'm not exactly at ""ramen is all I have"" status but potatoes, beans, rice, and cream o' wheat will only go so far and a pizza will hold me over for darn near 3 days before I actually finish it. Would anyone care to show me some pizza love?  Fair warning: I may decide to try to talk you out of it if you try to help... don't let me. It's something between pride and optimism... :)  **EDIT**: Request fulfilled. Thanks to dihydrogen_monoxide"
1648	False	a	No sob story. I am just hungry and would enjoy a pizza. I usually only eat organic, but, today I would like a pizza for lunch. I guess I should tell you  about myself! I am a 20 year old female in nursing school (I love it!) I am either going to be a flight nurse or psychiatric nurse. I also volunteer at the gift shop, at my local hospital, because I love to socialize and meet new people. If there is anything you would like to know about me, feel free to ask! 
1649	False	a	Hi Reddit!!  My husband and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary yesterday, but due to being broke and having to work we didn't get to celebrate! Today we are hoping to celebrate making it a year with some pizza, if you can help us out!  We greatly appreciate it :)
1650	False	a	Me and my 4 yr old daughter are both disabled so money is scarce but the family loves pizza so I'd like to treat them if someone could help out. Thanks
1651	False	a	I just moved here (from Texas) to gain residency for BU. In the past month I've gotten hit by a car and broke my dominant wrist, got the flu, my upstairs neighbors flooded my living room making it unusable, my job won't let me work because of my cast, I couldn't afford school, my mom lost her job, the entire city flooded, and now the pipes in my kitchen are severly leaking so the repair guy turned off the water and have completely disassembled my kitchen. I can't use the water in my apartment for two days (that includes cooking....and my stove is currently in the living room too.) A pizza would be great :/
1652	False	a	"I've been job hunting for three months now, this was meant to be my first summer living away from home but it's all gone wrong, I'm exhausted and a bit scared of what's going to happen. I'm blessed to be able to do enough cash in hand jobs to keep the rent people happy but right now I'm wishing for nothing more than a disk of dough with some cheese ontop.  Much love, good luck to any of you who might be trying to find a job in this crazy market atm.   EDIT: No word from Gaga :( any still looking gentle anons.   EDIT EDIT: I have no idea what ""any still looking"" means.   EDIT EDIT EDIT: I lovely young gentleman has brought up the subject of my account only being two months old, this would be a good point if it weren't for the fact that more than two seconds on my account shows I have been using my account for a lot of posts etc and this is actually my first time posting on this sub."
1653	False	a	We have no plans or money tonight and would really appreciate some pizza right now. Thanks RAoP :)
1654	False	a	Hi there, tried this once before without any luck but I think today is worth another try. Finished exams and I think a pizza would really be the best meal tonight, no effort and delicious! Thanks for reading
1655	True	a	Hi, everyone. I'm in college right now and have absolutely no money, and will continue to be broke until I get paid in two weeks. This is my first time posting on RAOP. I'm requesting a pizza not for me, but for my boyfriend. He's absolutely wonderful to me, and right now he's going through a really hard time. His mom is sick. Really sick. And normally in this kind of situation I would make/buy some kind of food for him. Giving food in times of hardship is a kneejerk reaction for me, it's just what I do. But since I can't afford to get him anything at all, I figured I'd give this subreddit a shot. I have no idea what else to do. I'm out of my depth with this. I have no idea what he's going through, so I don't have any idea what to say to make him feel better. But maybe him not having to worry about dinner would help a little bit.  Anyway, thank you for reading this and for your consideration. Sorry I rambled a lot up there.  **EDIT:** Thank you SO FREAKING MUCH, jetboyterp. You are absolutely amazing. I will definitely pay it forward in the future. Thank you!!!!
1656	True	a	Passing of my grandfather. 750 miles driven yesterday. 5 round trips to new york in 3 days from new haven, along with a rushed flight back from europe. Work... Lots of work... Exhaustion... 3 hours of sleep a night at most.. Anyways. Pizza is nice. Writing that out was pretty nice too. Finally have nothing to do. Anyways. If you are even reading this you are probably a pretty great person, so thanks.
1657	False	a	Nothing too special. Just packing and craving pizza.
1658	False	a	just asking its 7.50 cause of deal and would feed me and my little brother 
1659	False	a	I am an up-and-coming sci-fi and comic book writer who is chronically short on funds and pizza. I also have a fiance' and two kids living with me. For your generous donation of pizza, I will send you either MS Word .doc or Adobe PDFs of two (count them!), TWO short stories of mine. I will also select a high-quality scan of a classic comic book from my collection and share that with you (I'll try to come up with a short list from which you can pick).
1660	False	a	Hey my buddy and I are in between pay days and we would love some pizza, a medium should be fine for the two of us. Thanks in advance and god bless.
1661	False	a	Hey guys, very keen on pizza for dinner, especially as I have no plan B. :D
1662	False	a	My friends seem to doubt that this sub actually serves its purpose.  Prove it to me. PM me if interested. Also, I would love to kick back with a pizza and an Izze tonight.
1663	False	a	No real sob story here, just trying to test this out and me and my roommate are two broke ass college students looking for some pizza while we study. Thanks in advance (:
1664	True	a	**Miami, FL**  I've never tried this RaoP before, but I thought I'd give it a shot. I've had a shitty week at work, burnt myself trying to cook, and in the end I couldn't really eat it. Here's some [proof](http://i.imgur.com/TeGji0E.jpg).  A small pan pizza from Domino's sounds amazing right now, but I won't be picky! I'll even pick up at the store to save on the delivery fee.  Thanks in advance!  --- DJ
1665	False	a	Long story short my fiance is the only girl in a warehouse full of men that build high end mountain bikes ( Santa Cruz Mountain Bikes )....I planned on surprising her by having a pizza delivered to her station tomorrow for lunch but then I realized her place of work is full of hungry hard working people who would love to get the same treatment......well Reddit what do you think? can we make this happen 
1666	False	a	I just want a pizza. I'm tired of eggs, ramen, and grits. A pizza for dinner would be rad. That's all. Thank you.
1667	False	a	Haven't worked in a couple weeks and won't have money for another 2 or 3 weeks. Really looking to have some pizza to share with my family.
1668	False	a	Title kind of says it all, I haven't been able to make it to the grocery store in a while and I've been missing work due to illness so I'm a teensy tiny bit hella broke.  I will gladly trade a small custom embroidery for food, and/or pictures of my cat being a cat.
1669	False	a	Our roommates are probably about to cook something tasty that they will not be willing to share as we are not on the best of terms with each other. I think a large pepperoni pizza and one of our Blu-Rays would make for an enjoyable night. Thanks, guys.
1670	False	a	Admittedly, I was doing pretty well.  I was not having any financial problems and I was able to save some money.  Then my job cut my pay rate.  Suddenly I was struggling to pay the bills, but I managed.   Last week my wife went from being able to breast feed our son to completely dried up.  Now we have the added expense of lactose intolerant formula (he can't drink milk based stuff; it makes him sick) and a reduced income.  Faced with the decision of eating or feeding our son, we opted for the formula.  Unfortunately, I will not receive my paycheck until Saturday. We have enough formula for our son, but we've literally run out of food for ourselves.  Two days without food is not a lot -- and we could manage without -- but I would love to greet my wife with pizza tomorrow.
1671	False	a	It seems like a lot of requests are from people who had requested repeatedly in the past, sometimes that is all they post on reddit. I would like to give a pizza to a redditor who has contributed lots of non-pizza posts.   I'll plan on giving the person I choose a pizza tomorrow. PM me :)  EDIT: Thanks for everyone who messaged me. I've picked the pizza recipient! All further entries won't be considered. Have a great day!
1672	False	a	I'm staying with my friend Danielle in Los Angeles (Culver City) who is getting married tomorrow, she's too stressed out to cook and is claiming too stressed out to eat. I've got $22 left to my name til I head back to Canada. Can you help me help her out with pizza?
1673	True	a	My wife and I are avid pizza fans, but this month has been exceptionally tight fiscally. Having recently put together a new monthly budget (with more reasonable expenses) we've acted more responsibly, but had considerably less fun.   If anyone would be so kind as to reward our new financial responsibility with dietary irresponsibility, that would be grand. I'm sure the kids would love something more than just bland-yet-wholesome Spaghetti for the third night in a row.   Thanks for taking the time to read, and have a great day no matter what.
1674	False	a	I'm saving up money to buy a new phone, and could really use a pizza right now. I haven't eaten anything other than the stuff I have at home, and could use a little change. I'd be glad to pay it forward once I buy this phone and have money to spend.  Edited for redundancy.
1675	False	a	I'm a little embarrassed posting this, but I'm desperate.  Some unexpected bills came up and it's left me flat broke until Friday.  I haven't eaten since Saturday morning and it's literally starting to hurt.  If anyone can please, please help me out I would be eternally grateful.  
1676	False	a	guys, I have been living off of pbj for 2 days, due to a problem with the direct deposit money transfer that has left 2 dollars in my bank account as they sort it out.. I couldn't help but notice the influx of Papa John's coupons, but only have a dominos close to me :( can some kind redditor please help me out? I can make a promise to pay it forward and return the favor once the money situation is settled. Thank you for your kindness.
1677	False	a	So last night I lost my debit card, but I had to cancel it because what ever money I have is on that checking account.So with no money or access to money, until my bank opens, I couldn't even take the bus this morning. Luckily I had my bike so I could ride to my over-the-weekend tutoring job at my college...it took 2 hours. So yeah, I've been here on campus for a few hours now and I still have 4 more hours to go. I'm starving, I keep eating the free lollipops we hand out to students and drinking water to settle my stomach. If anyone out there would would help me I promise to return the favor. I work at Bellevue College, WA
1678	False	a	My ex wife got married yesterday.  It hasn't even been a year since we divorced.  I always believed we'd work things out.  I made lot of desperate attempts in the last month as the wedding got closer topping it off by pouring my heart out and basically begging her not to go through with it.  You can imagine how far any of that got me.  I actually spent yesterday believing I'd get word that she called it off.  I stayed up all night checking her facebook page to see if it happened.  At 8am I finally crashed.  A few hours later I woke up and there was the wedding picture, front and center.  A little bit after that she had her name changed on there, and that was that.    The last thing I had to eat was a granola bar for breakfast yesterday.  I've got no food in the house, and quite honestly, I've started drinking and driving wouldn't be the best idea.  And you know what?  I'm going to keep drinking.  Part of me knows that I should eat though, or it's going to be that much worse tomorrow.  I've got no money though, no food, but plenty of drink.  I'm going to continue torturing myself tonight, and tomorrow will be a new day.  Tonight I wallow though.  It hurts.  Cheers!  P.S.  Am I the only one who thinks that the first wedding your kids are in shouldn't be one of their parents?
1679	False	a	I can't say that any of us go hungry, or are living in squalid conditions, but god damnit we get sick of rice and beans.   We're located in Xer√©m, Duque de Caxias, RJ in Brazil. Our NGO works with orphans from poor communities, and also provides education and outreach services in many of those same communities.   I don't even know if ordering a pizza internationally would be even remotely possible where we are, which is why it is a bit of a challenge.  ALSO! WE'RE HIRING!! The pay is shit, but this place is amazing. We have plenty of food to eat, and a roof over our heads. The team is fantastic, but completely overwhelmed with work. If you speak Spanish or Portuguese, and have an interest in this kind of work, we could have you down here in as soon as a month.
1680	False	a	times are hard, and I'd just really enjoy a pizza like old times.
1681	False	a	Recently my roommate and I were both let go from the local hotel where we worked front desk.  We have been struggling to get by as unemployment barely pays enough to cover our basic expenses.  Lately we have eaten a lot of ramen/rice/toast/etc.  As of yesterday we are entirely out of food so today we decided we would try to apply for food stamps.  The application process is a lot of paperwork and processing so hopefully we can get some assistance by next week.  I'm not a fan of asking for handouts but when you haven't eaten in a few days I guess you just have to swallow your pride.  If anyone can help us out we would truly appreciate it and will definitely pay it forward when our financial situation turns around.   Location Rhode Island  **TL;DR**  Sooo poor and sooo hungry.    Also [here's a picture of my cats!](http://i.imgur.com/2ZNKYAI.jpg) because of well, ya know, reddit.  As a side note despite their owners situation, these kitties are **never** without food.  I would never let a helpless animal suffer because i'm having trouble making ends meet.
1682	False	a	Thanks in advance!
1683	True	a	I have been scared to ask for help. I lost my job in March, and money keeps getting tighter. I have a few interviews this week. So there is hope. I was wondering if anyone could help me this weekend? I will make sure to turn around and help when I get hired soon. 
1684	False	a	Puh puh pleaseeeee
1685	True	a	I recently moved out to AZ from LV and well... my story consists of heartbreak, pawning of items, and basically picking myself up from the ground.  I'll be more than glad to share my story, but honestly I could use a pizza. I've got no money for dinner and i've been making due with some ramen but yeah...It'd be nice to have a pizza.  I'm usually on the other end of this but this time I could really use the help.
1686	True	a	You can hold me to it, and even check up next week to see if I follow through. If i don't keep my word.... well i guess nothing will happen, but I assure you I'd feel too guilty not to.
1687	False	a	My best friend's not eaten all day or yesterday and is feeling sick. I've got no money, or I'd help him, and he's across the country with no way of getting anything to eat. I'm really worried about him because this happens frequently, and he gets sick because of it. If someone could get him a gift card, I would be eternally grateful. I can draw you a picture of Pinkie Pie, because that's the only thing I can draw. He's in California in the Orange County area  EDIT - Thank you, anonymous gifter! 
1688	True	a	We began a nonstop video game party Friday night. Somehow we managed to eat all of our snacks in one night, leaving us stranded in our dorms with no food. Our campus cafeteria is closed for the weekend, and we don't even have ramen. Please help us? :-(   Here is a picture for your trouble http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-saYh5WfGHOY/TZLo1uV04PI/AAAAAAAAADE/8w2gLMIqPWE/s1600/puppy_eyes-2.jpg
1689	False	a	I'm honesty feel a bit awkward doing this, but would appreciate any help.
1690	False	a	Job hunting, but finally ran out of money last week.  First time asking for a handout....feels weird.....reddit was the first place i felt comfortable asking.....living in Asheville, nc.  Just cheese would be more than appreciated by me and my girlfriend, nothing fancy, just hungry......  :(:
1691	True	a	I'm overdrawn 18$ so I'm going to pawn some things tomorrow so I can get out of that hole (expensive fees, ya know?) and I get paid on the first, and I plan to pay it forward, but until then it'd be awesome if someone could help me out on something to eat! Rice and peanut butter is getting very old.  Just look at that [smile](http://imgur.com/D5wIpKC) just thinking of getting a hot cheesy pizza! :)
1692	False	a	I just moved to Winston-Salem from Jacksonville (NC) to start a new job, but I don't get my first paycheck until Friday.   The process of moving has be financially tapped out (between my last rent payment in Jacksonville, and having to pay first month's rent and security deposit up here, all I have in the kitchen is a loaf of bread and PB &amp; J).  I have weighed the pro's and con's of sucking dick for a pepperoni pizza, but I thought I would try here first.
1693	True	a	So the story is simple.  Due to a miscommunication with my family I will not be able to have Christmas dinner with them this year.  To top matters off my wife lost her debit card (with access to her cash) and I had a credit card payment (that I scheduled and forgot about) and a car insurance payment drop me into the red until payday this Friday.  So I'm feeling bummed and really could use a pie tonight if anyone is feeling generous.  Edit: Wifes debit card came in the mail last night so we are no longer broke.  Thanks for everyone who looked at this and thanks Styx9001 for the offer but things aren't looking quite as depressing as before!  Merry Christmas (or winter holiday of your choice!) ^.^
1694	False	a	I'm Scottish and obviously I love soup, but to me it's a lunch food. Eating the pasta for lunch was really poor planning by myself, so anyone willing to donate me a proper dinner would be a hero.
1695	True	a	I've known about this lovely subreddit for a while, but always decided against actually posting a request because there are people in so much worse situations than I. But, at this point the new tab isn't quite so dire, sooo....  I don't want to whine or drag on. Basically, I've been jobless for a few months now. My sister is my roommate; I'm basically crashing here, but have to be out next month, as she's apparently moving in with her boyfriend after that. No, I don't feel good about being a jobless layabout. I've been job hunting hard but nothing's been working out, and I can only really get around on foot.  Anyway, so the only food I've had around here is potatoes. Which wouldn't be so bad, but there's really nothing to put on them (no butter for baked ones, no ketchup for fries, no oil or vinegar for cooking them with.) It's better than no food, but the combination of dry potatoes and tap water is crazy bland. The aforementioned sister spends most of her time with her boyfriend; my parents dropped off the bag of potatoes a couple of weeks ago. I don't wanna complain or anything, it's good to have a place to stay (for now) and sustenance,  but... a pizza, of any kind or any place, would be so so rad. Haven't pizza since July (my birthday.)   I will of course pizza it forward immediately when I'm in a position to do so, this subreddit is such a wonderful thing and needs all the offerers it can get to keep it running.  Hope I'm doing this right! Thanks!
1696	False	a	I honestly can't remember the last time I had pizza. It's a sad life, but when you're unemployed, luxuries such as pizza go away. Anyway, I've just been craving pizza like mad for a week or so, and I don't want to eat mac and cheese AGAIN for the third time this week. I'm going to be up super late studying for these 3 chapters and doing quizzes. Lurked for a while, but never submitted anything to this sub...hoping a generous soul will help out this hungry soul!
1697	True	a	I'm in a state of disbelief and shock. I don't have the energy to cook. Pizza would be a nice comfort right now, considering it's the next best thing to hugs.  I'm in Massachusetts. Dominos gift card is best. I'll draw a picture of anything you want in return, if you'd like, even though I'm not that good.  Edit: Request was fulfilled! Thank you jleichtman! (if you don't want your name here, PM me and I'll remove it)
1698	True	a	Having a long day at work, and this week has been hell. My truck stopped working and raising money to get it fixed, rent is due on the 1st, so I'm at a bind. Pizza would be the greatest uplift right now.  Edit/Update: Exact(*ish*) Location: Carbondale, IL 62901.
1699	False	a	bought some drinks for my me and my friends last night and now im broke and hungry
1700	False	a	So last night at my NYE party, some people my friends brought knocked over my soup I had made to last all week while trying to cram more beer into the fridge, it sucked. It was some kickass recipe I found on r/dollarfriendlymeals.  http://www.dollarfriendlymeals.com/post/13700973183/turkey-dumpling-soup  So that blew, also they didn't even eat most of what I had left out for munching. People suck sometimes. If you feel like hooking up Mr. Wexler with some Za, I would appreciate it, Brah.  Get it? Za Brah.  I apologize for that last part.
1701	False	a	I have never used RAOP before, but a redditor friend of mine told me about it and to try it out sometime when food is low.
1702	False	a	My suite-mates and I have all had terribly difficult weeks. We have all had programs, papers, and tests and I myself have two horrendous mathematics exams tomorrow. If anyone wanted to help out a few stressed out college students it would be very appreciated! I have been lurking and this subreddit seems to have a wonderful community!  Edit: Whoops, I need to proofread
1703	False	a	For the past 6 days I have been in Kansas City, MO visiting family. I just arrived back at logan airport about two hours ago. There's nothing in the house because i have yet to be able to go out. Its been a long day and pizza would be nice:)
1704	True	a	Hi RAoP!  I live in Miami and have been short on money. Chicken's pretty much the only thing our family's had since we moved down in August. (Father says it's the cheaper meat and can be spread out over days). Heh and I've been craving pizza recently (well, any other type of meat really) and was wondering if anyone could get me out of this chicken routine heh.  I don't really know what to provide you guys, but I here's a picture of my cow cat putting his paw on my hand :)  http://imgur.com/SEZH7
1705	False	a	I just want a pizza :]
1706	True	a	Now, I'm not poor, per se. Yes, there's currently $5 in my bank account total, but I'm not wanting for food. I stocked up at the store and I have enough to eat.  That being said, I'm sick of it. Everything I have is based on sandwiches. Ham on wheat. Eggs on wheat. Peanut butter and jelly... on wheat.  I've got enough food and I don't have a particularly rough life, so I'd hate to argue for the front of the queue of this font of generosity, but...  ... if anyone wants to help me have a hot delicious meal as opposed to an acceptable room temperature meal... it'd lift my spirits.  Thank you very much for your consideration.
1707	False	a	Greetings all. This is a brilliant subreddit, and deserves all the attention it's been getting. Anyways; I'm stuck at work until 5PM. I don't have a lunch, nor the money for it (my paycheck isn't until next week). Any kind folks out there willing to trade a pizza IOU? Will definitely be returning the favor next week.
1708	False	a	"Too flippin hot outside to want to go anywhere (aka, i'm lazy).  Coworkers will be like ""Hey, where did you get the pizza?"" and I'll be all like ""Yo, some bad ass mofo inside my computa bought this fo me""  Or I could respond using proper English if you prefer. Or I could dance a jig and put a slice on my head.  edit: And now its POURING outside so I REALLY don't want to go anywhere."
1709	False	a	Anyone feel like donating a pizza to a hungry college student? I'd be very happy to eat today. 
1710	False	a	Title says it. Really jonesing for a pizza while we chat about the future and money problems. A little something to brighten up the mood. 
1711	True	a	After a lengthy conversation with my financial aid office, I have found out I will be receiving little to no benefit whatsoever from my school that aren't loans (this is actually a pretty big deal for me, personally) and for the summer I have no access to loans so I'm without any money after rent goes through. Some pizza would be **damn** good right about now. I'm in Irvine, CA if someone would be so kind :)
1712	False	a	Haven't done this before, won't pull at your heartstrings. What I will say is that i haven't eaten anything since Friday, I have no food in and no money to buy any. If anyone feels like helping a brother out, it would be much appreciated. Will happily return the favour when student loans come in in a couple of weeks.
1713	False	a	Just like the the post says. Tried to make it til the next paycheck (tomorrow), but ran out of food yesterday. Haven't eaten today at all and I figured I'd try RAOP. Someone on reddit before sent me crispy M&amp;Ms before so I know people are nice enough to do stuff like this. I can provide proof of brokeness and am definitely willing to pay the pizza forward to either the giver or someone else next week. Even as early as tomorrow. I can provide whatever verification necessary
1714	True	a	Lost my job a few weeks ago, and the pantry has run dry. I would glady repay any generosity shown here this evening. I'm being evicted from my home within a week or so. Any food would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.
1715	True	a	"&lt;a href=""http://imgur.com/CPw0Q"" title=""Hosted by imgur.com""&gt;http://imgur.com/CPw0Q.jpg&lt;/a&gt;   pic of what a hungry baby may look like"
1716	False	a	So by a series of bad timing and bureaucratic paperworkery my unemployment benefits are in limbo. I haven't had benefits for a month, when I should have (they're reviewing my case, which is standard procedure but they're behind so their 2 week time frame has morphed into a five week time frame), I'm just frustrated and broke, but I should be getting money monday (finally), and a pizza could feed me all weekend.  I hope this doesn't sound too much like begging. If it doesn't happen it doesn't happen. Of course when I'm back on my feet I will pizza this forward to someone who needs it at that time.
1717	True	a	Planned on having some good old beans on toast for dinner but the bread has gone off and I have no money to pick some up
1718	True	a	My friends and I are poor medical students living out of dorms next to the hospital in Portland, Maine.  There's 3 of us here now, the other 3 are working their morning shift - 6:30AM to 5PM.  I think it would be awesome to surprise them with pizza when they come back. What do you think reddit?  Can we get them some pizza?
1719	False	a	I know this is second time I requested on here, but unfortunately no such luck, so I thought i'd try again. Like it says in the title, I'm low on cash this month, and would greatly appreciate a pizza. I promise that'll come give back once I get back on my feet. 
1720	False	a	[the desired pizza &lt;3](http://imgur.com/MFm5B)
1721	False	a	Not a lot left for money left for college. Looking for a job and pizza. Who will be my knight in shining pizza?
1722	False	a	Me and a friend have spent the entire night sitting in my dorm room playing Super Mario World. We're on Chocolate Island right now, but just realized that we missed dinner. And, of course, we're both broke. But we really want to 100% this game tonight, so any nourishment would be very nice, and I would love you forever! I'd be happy to take a picture when we beat the game tonight :)  Proof: http://i.imgur.com/AYUph.jpg http://i.imgur.com/MuEXZ.jpg
1723	False	a	Just a couple of hungry teens (16) willing to do just about anything for one free pizza!
1724	True	a	Posted this yesterday, no luck. Just wondering if anyone out there might have a pizza to spare for someone who is out of luck temporarily to enjoy a pizza!  I'm from Houston, TX.  I've been lurking here for several months, and for some reason this was the first place that popped in mind since I got home.  Me and my Sister were in a car wreck last Thursday. We got T-boned in a parking lot by someone who apparently thought talking on their cell phone was more important than watching the road or applying the breaks... Fortunately it was just her and I in the car and they hit the back passenger door, because had they of hit just a foot or two up, I don't think we both would have survived. We were both taken to the hospital in an ambulance, and my wallet was left in our total'd car which was towed. Hopefully it wasn't stolen or anything and it's still where I left it in the car.  Anyway I don't want to ramble, but to sum it up, my Sister and I would be very grateful to anyone willing to help someone out in a tough spot with some pizza. When things get settled out here and I get back on my feet(literally!) then definitely plan on returning the favor to someone who's in a bind and could use the help.  Thank you so much!
1725	True	a	just a guy out of money after Christmas shopping for may family. no money left in my bank and credit card is maxed. i got paid last tues and had to go Christmas shopping be for me and my sister (we share an apartment) have to drive to Maine to see our parents for Christmas. i would really be thankful and be in dept to RAOP. me and an IRL friend have always wanted to help someone out on here and i never got the chance but next month is going to be great (huge work bonus) and i plan to give at least two pizza's if not more. but if you could help my sister and I, it would be awesome!  anyway thanks for reading reddit!  chunk 
1726	True	a	So it's finals week and I haven't eaten all day... I just payed off the last of my housing and I've let my mom borrow around $400, so I don't have much money to get food this week. I would love a pizza, and would love to offer one as soon as I get my money paid back.  Thanks for this subreddit. I think you are all amazing people. :)  Edit:Forgot to say I live in Texas USA. :)
1727	False	a	Family is almost homeless but broke.  I am asking for some help please for food tonight 
1728	True	a	I am a single mother of 4 - currently unemployed and looking for work. I've applied to numerous jobs and havent heard anything back as of yet. My children would love to have some pizza for dinner. Just looking for something different to feed them besides mac &amp; cheese.
1729	False	a	hey, im a engineering major (recently changed from cultural studies) and am visiting my grandparents in florida. Im not exactly broke but I need the rest of my money to travel back to college, and I want the pizza to be a surprise for my grandparents to show my gratitude for their contribution to my tuition. I have a verification code, and although Im a new account, will do anything to verify my need.  thanks, charliej
1730	True	a	My parents are out of town for the weekend and I was left no money for food, I would really appreciate a pizza right about now.
1731	False	a	We are broke till thrusday and have nothing to fix at our house We would LOVE some pizza could somone PLEASE help WILL pif (Pay It Foward)  We live in NC we have no gas to pick it up so it will to be Delievered
1732	False	a	All I have is ramen in the house, would love some pizza.  No one wants to hear a sob story, so just save me from the monotony of ramen.
1733	False	a	Hey, RAOP. I'm a college student in Seattle, Washington. I just scored a job and am expecting my first paycheck in a little over a week, but as of right now I'm down to a a couple cans of green beans and 3 potatoes, and I need a bit more to tide me over until I can get money for groceries. A friend recommended I try to drop a post here and see how it goes, so here I am. 
1734	True	a	Edit: I'm sorry, I forgot to say I live in Minnesota, USA.  Hey everyone, I'd really enjoy a full stomach tonight, my future is looking extremely down, but I have the next four days to enjoy, I'll share my story, it's a little lengthy, but you certainly deserve to know why I'm asking for a meal tonight.  The sparknotes version is that my Dad passed away when I was young, too young to really remember anything about him other then he loved Star Trek. After that, my Mom remarried a man, who was very abusive. We lived on for about a year and then my Mom passed away. Both of my parents had cancer, I don't know if I do or not, I'm not 100% sure on how the genetics work with something like that.  Anyways, I lived with him for about two years until I moved in with a family from a church. They were in their mid 50's, not at all a good age to raise a 12 year old apparently. They were beyond abrasive to me and just wasn't a good fit, but I had no choice. After about three years I moved up north with a family for about four months when they decided they were too young and busy for me. They were in their late twenties and they had just had two kids, again, not a good fit. I was kicked out on a moments notice had my aunt pick me up and drive me back to the cities. My aunt then proceeded to drop me off at her apartment and tell me that no one in my family is willing to take me in. I waited on the curb with all of my stuff, calling friends, until one of their families wanted to take me in. I lived with them for about two years until they decided they needed to move to Iowa, they offered to take me with, but I declined because a friend in school wanted me to graduate with him. I lived there until I graduated.  About a week after I graduated, they had a death in the family and needed to use my room for company. I could certainly understand, so I moved into a place where a guy owns a house and just rents out rooms, found on craigslist. Being seventeen, I didn't have much of an option because most apartment buildings wouldn't allow me to move in being underage.  I started working at a game store that I loved right near by where I lived, it was a place where I would put in like 40-60 hours a week, sometimes paid for overtime, most of the time not. I loved that store, but a year after I started, the store had to close down due to investor issues. I had about a week's notice and the closing day was the day before Christmas Eve. I was unemployed for a few months until I started working at another game store, but they lasted about four months after I started working there.   Currently, I'm working at a Car Wash while trying to get into something with gaming. I'm not aiming to make it though, I'm in debt to my landlords and I don't make nearly enough money to pay it back currently. I was a bright student, but I've had no opportunity to go to college or anything, I don't have the safety net of a family.  My phone is going to be turned off any minute, I owe Redbox money for a rental that I can't repay (Another stupidly long story), and I owe my landlord $525.00 on Sunday, and I currently have about $4 to my name. I have no where to turn for help, I'm just trying to enjoy the days I have left.  If someone would be willing to make tonight a great night by buying me a meal, I'd be forever grateful.   Thanks for reading, any words of encouragement would be appreciated too.
1735	False	a	I'm a student preparing for the last few weeks before I graduate, and would greatly appreciate a pizza to reduce some stress
1736	False	a	Broke as hell and having to move back in with my mom in a week. Would love a pizza to lift the spirits. I'll live either way, but figured maybe someone would be kind :) &lt;3
1737	False	a	One of my PT jobs that allows me to keep teaching will involve stuffing hundreds of envelopes with my boss tonight. Pizza would be awesome, would restore my faith in...nah, I have faith in humanity. Just think it would keep our spirits up to have some tasty pizza :)  Will pay it forward (will anyway, whether we get any or not...love this sub :)
1738	False	a	I'm just a poor college kid begging for hand-outs.  I've been out of a job for a month and a half and haven't had much luck yet (not for lack of trying or interviews).  To qualify for food stamps (which I was using) you must work 20 hrs. a week if you're in school, at least, so I didn't get that this month and I'm broke.  I would love something greasy and cheesy (and mushroomy?) that is not canned black beans and white rice.  I can offer silly drawings in paint, help build something in Minecraft, perhaps even your own song if you can wait a week... make that two weeks (I'm kinda sick and don't really have a singing voice right now)....  Anyway, I also need a tablet, but pretend it's a really good drawing of me and comparably pathetic to a sad puppy: http://i.imgur.com/7EqsN.png  Edit: I live in central Wisconsin, US.
1739	True	a	Inbetween jobs and havent gotten my first paycheck for my new place, so im living off 3 dollars till next friday. All my money has gone to my bus fair since i take 6 buses a day to get to &amp; from work.  Living in MN and i believe everyone delivers to me, with alot of coupons.  EDIT: Pizza'd thank you /u/sevenzig ! 
1740	True	a	Having a rough couple days up here at sacred heart. No money to eat and the cafeteria charges $2 for a 20 Oz. soft drink. The hospital food is horrible and they only give enough for the patient. A pizza would be absolutely amazing. thank you to all who read/comment. your time is much appreciated. Proof is available.
1741	False	a	Just want pizza for watching amines with tomorrow. Example:  [Man painting picture of dragon riding airplane using pizza as palate.](http://imgur.com/GDcKUKP)  
1742	True	a	I've loved RAOP for a very long time and always wanted to participate and give someone pizza, but never had the chance.  Now that I'm in a time of need I feel like RAOP will be there for me.   I haven't eaten for two days and only slept about 20 hours this week due to working on installations.    **However!**  I was just commissioned for two pieces and will be paid within the month!  So for the person who does help me out tonight, I will buy you or a person of your choosing pizza once I get paid.   Thank you in advance!  This is honestly one of the best communities on Reddit.
1743	False	a	Hello!  I'm down on my luck, and would love more than anything to have a pizza tonight so I can watch the Obama/Romney debate with some food in me! (Cause you know I will need it.)  Thanks :)
1744	False	a	Yeah. I get that there are plenty of people in need. I'm not really, got all the standard food that students live off of. I just felt like something meaty as heck, so here's my request. Equally happy to have someone local and lonesome come and join me for dinner and bad Australian television. Bring a dvd or something!
1745	True	a	I've been unemployed for a while now, and while I've been job-searching, my roommates have been awesome. They've yet to charge me rent, and have given me food, beer, and most importantly, support.  I really love these guys and I'd like to do something nice for them. I usually keep the house pretty clean, doing dishes, taking out the trash, and anything else my broke ass can do to show appreciation.  I know it's a long shot, but I thought I'd try RAoP. It would be really awesome if they could come home from work to a couple of pizzas. I don't know if it's in bad taste to ask for more than one, but we're three guys and one would just not be enough.  Thanks,  Robotbeard
1746	False	a	I've known about this subreddit for about a week, but I've been kind of reluctant to request because I see people who have either had really good or really bad things happen to them, and I would feel bad if I got a pizza they didn't. I still don't have anything really good or really bad happening to me, I'd just like a pizza and can't afford one, as well as I've got a lot of school work to do this evening. I worked through lunch (I just forgot) and for dinner they only had chicken (I worked at a chicken factory, so it's kind of difficult for me to eat chicken and not feel at least a little queasy), I ate a couple bowls of cereal but I think I'm going to be up pretty late as I'm also studying for a polisci exam on Tuesday, and I am already getting the rumbles, if someone could help me out this evening, I would truly appreciate it and be more than willing to pay it forward.  Edit: The only place that delivers here (there is one other, but the owner verbally abused a good friend of mine while she was at work for not handing out flyers the day after he dropped them off at the office) actually closes at 11, but thank you for taking the time to read it, have a good day and  if you're looking for a sign to buy someone a pizza or you're just too embarrassed to request one, go for it, take part in this community!
1747	False	a	so my girlfriend is a waitress and has been sick for the last couple days, we rely on her tips for food and what not. She is feeling better today but is moping around the house because she is worried about well EVERYTHING. I think a pizza fix would cheer her up. what do you think?
1748	False	a	We're a young couple in California struggling to get by.  The good news is we're both working again and my first paycheck comes next week!  However, I'd be understating the situation if I said our bank account was merely empty.  We're looking for a kind soul to provide a meal for us this evening.  In exchange, we're thrilled to use part of that first pay check to send a pizza to TWO hungry people next.  What a wonderful system, and we're hoping it'll work for us.  Please touch base with us and we'll give you whatever information you need.  Thanks so, so much, and we look forward to, well, paying it forward!
1749	False	a	So... My roomates just left out to go food shopping. They both rely soley on food stamps for groceries. I'm out of work, they help me with food when they can. I am sure they will buy me something to eat (something I haven't had the luxury of doing as of yet today), but that won't be for some time... and I would really like to have something waiting for them to eat when they come back. I know it would make their day. I'm currently babysitting their kids who are getting a little ~~crazy~~ restless. I know food will be here eventually, so if you can give to someone who won't eat otherwise, please do. Barring that, it would really make my day and occupy the mouths of these rugrats lol.  Edit: All is well, food has arrived and smells delicious. crisis averted. no pizzas needed here. thank you for the time and consideration though.
1750	False	a	To whom it may concern, I just bombed a Math test and now I will be up all night studying for Finals and doing most of my Math work that is do tomorrow. If anyone could take pity on a brother I would greatly appreciate it. 
1751	False	a	Moved into my new apartment with a higher rent a few weeks ago, no money until later this week :c if anyone wants to hook me up with a pizza, I'd be forever grateful.
1752	False	a	I don't have a sob-story, just think a pizza for me and the family would be nice until we get paid tomorrow.
1753	False	a	Hello, Pizza Gods? Are you there? It's me, OmNomdePlum.  I am but a humble tall ship sailor, which as you well know, in this day in age means I've taken vows of voluntary poverty. Teaching children how to sail an 18th century ship is well and good - however there's a point where one realizes that it's not paying the bills.   So, having recently returned from life on the high seas, I find myself working my arse off to pay the sudden onslaught of bills that I've returned to, which leaves little for food stuffs. I've applied for work at the Seattle Art Museum (they have some awesome exhibitions coming in), but should I get this job, I won't see positive pay off well into next month.   Thus, Pizza Gods.. here I am, a sailor with a roof, but no nom'ibles. Please, if it is within your power to do so, send me a sign - an omen of good will that will get me through the night, and hopefully tomorrow - I'll find out if I get that job tomorrow or not.  In the name of the Godfather, the Caesar &amp; the long lost, but not forgotten Domino mascot, I pray.   Amen. 
1754	False	a	So my cheque from my temp job decided not to show up in the mail today, and won't arrive until Monday at the earliest now.  I am down to three cans of tuna, and two packages of ramen.  Anyone out there feeling generous?
1755	False	a	Hello, I am making this post because my friends and I are currently being held hostage by a pizza troll in Kalamazoo, MI. The pizza troll demands we provide him pizza or else we can not leave. Unfortunately we have no money, please save us from our pizza troll and next time we can save you! (We are really hungry and have no money right now, if you could help us out that would be really wonderful and we will pass the favor along when we can.)
1756	False	a	My scary troll neighbors vandalized my car and I had to have it towed today. My poor stomach is growling and I have no way to get delicious noms! Please help me out!!!
1757	False	a	Hey guys, my parents have left on Wednesday and they only left me ¬£25 to live on for 7 days. I now have exactly ¬£0.00 left. If any generous person could send me a pizza, I'd love you forever.  Sincerely,  A random 16 year old in the UK.
1758	True	a	[Sadness](http://i.imgur.com/EBDoI.png)  I'd appreciate any help. I'm a hungry college and I don't start my new job until tomorrow. If I have to eat one more can of tuna I might die.
1759	False	a	My mom only has 20 dollars left until next week which she is going to use for gas to get to work. My dad is 3 weeks late on child support. All my fam has been eating is toast or soup. Some pizza would be nice. thank you.
1760	False	a	Don't get to spend as much time with him as I'd like to. We both love pizza! Help us out plleeeaaassseee!
1761	False	a	That's right folks, I'll do mostly anything silly for a taste of the greasy goodness. Parents are out of town and I'm flat broke, so I thought I'd try and give laughs in return for pizza.   Fairbanks, Alaska area. Papa Johns, Dominos, or Pizza Hut would be most appreciated.
1762	True	a	I am part of a team of four AmeriCorps VISTAs about 45 minutes south of Cleveland Ohio, and we only make around $900 a month. If you don't know what AmeriCorp is, check out www.americorps.gov. Two of us work on a financial literacy program that offers classes on banking, credit, etc., and myself and another person work on a program that helps empower individuals to become self-sustaining through education and a community based mentorship program.  I would really like to get my teammates pizza for for lunch today. I'd get us all pizza myself if I could afford it! We typically all bring in our own lunches, but sandwiches, bagels, and leftovers are getting a bit old.   Thanks in advance! I can, and will, provide a picture as a thank you.   
1763	False	a	So, we are in Terrassa, Espa√±a (Spain). Today we were woken up by police and forced to leave our home. We are activist organizers from France, Spain, and the States. The reason we were kicked out was because we were squatting the derilict home. It made no difference, of course, that we were fixing the place up and providing a safe place for travelers, and others with no home, to sleep.   No matter if you agree or disagree with our stance on property rights, pizza would go a really long way to making such a crummy day nicer.   Buenos Dias.
1764	False	a	Haven't been paid in 5 weeks, will be paid next week and can buy a pizza for someone then. Can explain more if I need to but I just feel like eating something other than rice and pasta.  Thanks

1767	True	a	Ok so my name is Alex or Axeltoss, I am a starcraft 2 caster and am currently at MLG Orlando with Steven Bonnell, a popular starcraft 2 personality... (ROOTDestiny, QxGDestiny).   Steven did a charity drive a while back where he raised over $30,000 with a friend but as a result his paypal was frozen so he can't buy anything. Proof of that is here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe2pI21GCic   I've spent a lot of my own money on both of us this weekend because of this fact, and I've been spending way too much. I was hoping someone out there could send us a pizza or two. Here is proof of us existing:   http://www.twitch.tv/axeltoss/b/297568206   Thanks a lot for reading. Zipcode is 34746
1768	False	a	New to this whole RAOP thing :x I'm here visiting my sick girlfriend who lives a few hours away for the weekend and we're really hungry!  I won't be seeing her this New Years and I'm using my money for gas :|  We would really appreciate it!
1769	True	a	Last few days alone in my student house before i'm homeless. Would really appreciate a solid meal to cheer me up and give me the energy to carry on looking for jobs/somewhere to live. I'm sure there are people more worthy than I, but i feel i've exhausted everything else bar soup kitchens. I'm pretty new to all this,, but i'm sure i'll be back on my feet soon and will be happy to repay the favour to another worthy redditor.  
1770	True	a	I am always working, and my eldest (who is 16) helps take care of the house and other two kids while I am at work. Tonight, I would like to treat them to a nice pizza and wings dinner, but I have no money. Please help.  P.S. Dominos is their favorite 
1771	False	a	I saw a pizza cut into a Triforce over on r/gaming and I thought it was really awesome. That got me hungry for pizza so I looked all over for my Topper's Pizza stickers so I could get a free pizza because i am frugal but I only had 8 of 10 stickers. So if a person would be kind enough to buy me a random pizza, I would be very glad and then you would be my reddit friend.  Optional: getting the pizza cut into a Triforce.  Also, I am an Ent and I love all you Ents out there. [4]
1772	False	a	Just down this last week, cant afford more then the basics and would love a couple pizzas to hold me over for a few days and cheer me up a bit! im located in the usa, and such if yall are willing to help me out.   Thankss!
1773	False	a	I would love you forever and ever!
1774	True	a	The government screwed up and now we have to wait over a month for them to refile and reestablish my claim.  There is no way to expedite this at all, in spite of the fact that it is their mistake.  We have 2 girls (9 and 7) and 3 boys (5,3, 2months).  My wife had to be taken by ambulance to the hospital last week for emergency gall bladder removal surgery and we are feeling a bit beat on at the moment.  This would be a humungous pick-us-up.  I am happy to provide any verification you need.  Thanks in advance.  **EDIT: http://imgur.com/4FXXT Thank you so much Gama-Go!**
1775	False	a	We live in tempe and just haven't been able to afford food for a couple days. We are about running out of options and really hope someone can help us out:( text me for details if your willing to help. God bless you all&lt;3 9283861115
1776	False	a	Unemployed, poor, etc.  More importantly, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY!! Help me celebrate with a birthday pie?
1777	False	a	I have a friend over, and we don't have much for dinner. Thought I could give this a shot.
1778	False	a	I'd really love some pizza, preferably Papa Johns but any would do, honestly. I'm in the LA area due east. Thanks everyone for your infinite kindness!
1779	True	a	Been a cancer(glioblastoma) survivor for 3 years now and been trying to find myself a permanent stable job, been surviving but this month has been rough. High bills this month and a car accident have cost me a lot of money, plus the gas use from having like 4 appts with the doctor and oncology(both about 30 min away) have drained my acct to about 2 dollars. It'd be awesome to dig into a pizza tonight instead of try and find something resembling a meal in my fridge or resorting to eating a roommate's food since he's not in the best of situations either.   Halp?
1780	True	a	I haven't had a pizza in months and I currently have -$9 in the bank :c I haven't had any sign of my financial aid showing up yet, and I'm starving!  In return I'd gladly draw anything you'd wish  Here's some of my digital art as an example: http://imgur.com/a/ehpgm  *edit: just fixing formatting because mobile can be wonky at times
1781	False	a	Hi RAoP, I'm new to the sub,and today my girlfriend left me, telling me to kill myself and that I deserve to die, calling me fat and saying that I'm useless, so, since she is calling me fat, I might as well sit back, relax, and get fat. Help me RAoP, stress is killing me.
1782	False	a	I graduated last fall with a major in communications. I definitely regret not choosing a major that was more profitable, as I am still working the same retail job that I've had for a few years. I don't mind my job but I'm ready to branch out and find something better. As I got closer and closer to my graduation date I kept telling myself that 2012 is my year. I am not new to Reddit or living check to check, so I'm here looking for a mutual exchange. I'm proficient with Microsoft Office, Photoshop, Quickbooks, and researching just about any topic for you. It has been so long since I've had a meal that wasn't rice, beans or noodles. I'm very grateful for what I have, but a pizza would just rock my world! Please let me know what kind of work you would like to have done and any deadlines if possible. Thank you for considering me.
1783	True	a	Hello all, I am broke and out of food and decided to try this out. I'm a 24 year old male living in Phoenix. I moved out here in October 2010 to move into a halfway house. I am an addict in recovery, been sober 11 months. In the beginning of December I moved out into my own apartment. One of the complex managers lived in the halfway house with me and was able to get me an apartment and a job painting the complex. So I have been painting to pay for the place. I am trying to food stamps, but my passport (which is required for the process) appears to have been lost in the mail, quite unfortunately. I have been receiving a lot of help from people, but at this time I do not have any food so I figured I would try this out. Thanks for reading.
1784	False	a	The summer is an incredibly slow season due to residing in a student saturated city (when school is out, so is the population). Bills among other strokes of terrible luck have left me with less than $1 in my pocket and one box of mac n' cheese without any milk to make it. All I want is to be able to eat some dinner tonight. Help a fellow Redditor out?
1785	True	a	So i've been descending the winding staircase of heroin addiction over the past couple months, but i've finally taken steps to save myself from myself. I deleted my dealers numbers and got a withdrawal survival kit going (water, toilet paper, and some bud) but between that and my debts from using I'm flat broke. It didn't matter yesterday since between the puking and shitting i didnt exactly have time to eat, but now I feel like I can finally stomach something. I'm suffering through a day at work right now but I get home around 7, and there's a dominoes down the road...im through getting high with a lil help from my friends, but can anyone help me get by? i sincerely thank anyone who even considers helping me out, you (hopefully) have no idea how alone i feel dealing with this self inflicted hell   edit: one more thing, on the off chance anyone end up wanting to help either tonight or tomorrow afternoon, my doorbell doesnt work so if possible tell the delivery dude to give a quick shout at the 2nd floor front window, trust me ill be lying right there in bed the whole time. or, if its easier, i can pm my philanthropist hero my cell number so the delivery guy/gal can just call me
1786	False	a	Like I said, just dropped my truck off earlier today at the shop, am spending my last bit of money on that as it's a necessity, but unfortunately, I don't have any food in the apartment as I just got back from house sitting for a week. Can anyone help?
1787	False	a	My family (myself, husband, and 5 year old son) are in need of dinner tonight. We have been waiting for our paychecks that were supposed to show up on Tuesday. They have yet to come. Meanwhile, we have no food in the house. I have a friend that is coming to give us some cash to get through the next few days but she can't come until tomorrow morning - that's when she herself gets paid.  We are in desperate need for something to get us through tonight. We do have several pizza places and places to order in from (Dominos, Hungry Howies, Papa Johns to name a few) and am hoping some generous soul will be willing to help us in any way. I'm willing to provide any information needed to help! 
1788	False	a	Raleigh, NC
1789	False	a	I just arrived back at school after visting my family in Wisconsin over the holidays. Unfortunately while I was there I ran in to some pretty serious car problems and a hefty bill. Paying for my car so I could make it back to school cost everything in my bank account (and a couple hundred dollars my parents were able to help me with ): ). Now I'm at my appartment with nothing to eat and could really use a pie to tide me over untill class starts monday and I get my financial aide. Thanks 
1790	True	a	Me and my friend are stuck at my house with nothing to eat and no money. we have no car and some ball searing heat outside here in Las Vegas. help a couple of bros out. Thanks guys.  EDIT: Request filled thanks to [notbumble](http://www.reddit.com/user/notbumble)'s baller ass self.
1791	False	a	I just thought it would be a nice idea, definitely will pay it forward on payday.  Edit: I've never done this before so I apologize if I messed up somehow.
1792	False	a	Nothing special here really, Poked my head into RAoP when it first started thought its a pretty cool idea.  There ARE other redditors who NEED such a service more than myself, but hey, its free pizza right? =p  If anyone is in the mood for giving feel free to drop me a PM, I live in a rural town with no large pizza franchises, so I'm not sure how that would even work &gt;_&lt;  Cheers all!
1793	False	a	No sob story here i'm afraid folks and i'm a guy so no tales of how i'm on my own in bed wearing a tiny pair of pants (does that ever work?) I'm not really expecting anything to be honest  Just got my first car (Peugeot 106 1.1 liter!) which came to ¬£450 and the insurance which came to ¬£1500 for the year, i only passed my test a couple of days ago at the fourth attempt (so hang in there anyone still doing it.. So worth it!) basically i haven't got a penny to my name and i'm suffering a touch of buyers remorse but man i love driving   Hope everyone's having a good day! If anyone's in the UK, did you hear that thunder?! Awesomeeeeee 
1794	False	a	Probably a long shot. But I worked a long 10 hour shift and came home to an empty refrigerator. I can pay you back Tuesday. I can give you bank statements and my phone number.
1795	False	a	So, I am having surgery Monday to hopefully end years of a painful rare kidney disease. I am sitting at home today realizing that today is really the last day I could really enjoy a great meal but I am broke....   I keep thinking about a week or more worth of hospital food, ok the jello will rock, and I am jonesing now for a pizza!   I will be more than willing to pay it forward once recovered!
1796	False	a	Didn't bring my lunch today (not sure what I would've brought anyway) and currently overdrafted do to some issues splitting a checking account.  Would love to get a pizza, all that is nearby is a local store though and the only way I can tell that pizza could be purchased remotely is to send a $10/$25 gift card. I can't eat a whole pizza by any means so a $10 card would be enough for two slices and something to drink.  I get paid in 2 weeks and will be returning the RAOP favor for a needy soul then.  Edit: Forgot I drew a [picture of pizza](http://imgur.com/sZgfa) just because
1797	True	a	   [request] SAP in [California] comes to you in her time of pizza need.  So I am more of a lurker and I know it makes me look bad but I have been here nearly three years and I hope that gives me some credit. (I am great at run-on sentences).   My little family of two and one cat would love to indulge in a pizza. We have been going through some tough times recently. We just paid the rent and now have 24$ to our name. We are going to do whatever we can to have it hold us over until Wednesday. A pizza is not a necessity but it would be a real treat.   In exchange I can offer pictures of my adorable cat Charlie (he has plenty of food so there are no worries there) and a promise to pay it forward as soon as I can.   Thank you Random_Acts_Of_Pizza!
1798	False	a	I was working at a job where I was getting 25-40 hours a week when they suddenly knocked my hours down to 5-18. It took me five months to find this job and work is hard to come by around my area. Also, my girlfriend just got diagnosed cervical cancer so she cannot work. What little food I have left in my house is until my food stamps come in the first week of October. I have some paycheck stubs as proof, but I do not feel comfortable showing them around because of my personal information thats on there. Please help us not eat canned stew tonight again. 
1799	False	a	62 cents in bank account, awesome, but not complaining. I get paid tomorrow so if anyone can get me some pizza to get me by today, that would be awesome!!
1800	False	a	I was just laid off today, due to my original job being phased out of existence. While I have been as accommodating as possible to make my employers see my ability to learn new things and excel at every job put in my path, they decided because I haven't worked there as long as others I got laid off. It was also implied that the last position I was training for couldn't be done by me because I'm a girl. (Apparently being a girl means I can't use a wrench or climb a ladder.) Unfortunately because it wasn't out right said, I can do no legal action. Could really use an upside to this day.  **Edit: Thank you so much to *unmoderated* for the gift of pizza and literature! You made my day infinitely better!**
1801	False	a	Anyone feeling kind enough to hand out a stuffed crust supreme or two from pizza hut? they are $10 each.
1802	True	a	Could kill for a Pizza... i've spent all day digging a pond in my disabled parents garden, since im unemployed at the moment due to being a student, i've been trying to keep busy and help out other people at the same time. Hopefully i'll get a reply for this :)  Edit:  Downvotes already? Awesome :/
1803	False	a	Howdy all, long time pizza provider here. Some folks at [/r/starcraft](/r/starcraft) put together a king of the hill tournament and stream it every night in different player skill levels.  It gives newer and experienced players a place to have fun and their own 15 minutes of fame. They don't give out prizes really, but winners get a reddit icon. Some users send a T-shirt to people who win more than X games in a row.  Would RAOP be interested in providing a pizza to the winner of a raffle? I want to give everyone who watches and plays a ticket into the raffle and pick a winner for ROAP to offer pizza.  Viewers who tweet @Something will be given one entry. Players who lose are given 2 entries, and winners would be given 3 entries per win.  I'm sorry if I violated any rules of this subreddit. I'm not trying to create some scam, and I don't run the event - it's organically composed - but this is technically still a (statistically) random act of pizza.  **EDIT** DERP they have a  website too http://rcraftgaming.com
1804	False	a	I've been told about this website from various sources and I think this is an amazing place because I love pizza!  I have a couple people over to have a good time, we bought some beer, and now we have the drunkin munchines. HELP!   A future request for pizza will be accepted by me. 
1805	False	a	Hello, everyone! I'm new to this website. I was chatting with someone on a different website about how it totally sucks when you're really hungry and someone calls you up telling you all about the awesome food they just made. It ended up turning into a talk about how I've only got enough food in the house for my little one to eat until Saturday (which is when my food stamps refresh). So they linked me here! I didn't even know that something like this existed, it is amazing~  I've got to work tonight at 5, but my place of employment is right next to a Dominos, so carry out would be the best option, if anyone is feeling generous today. I'd really appreciate it!  Thanks for reading!
1806	False	a	So i recently got laid off from my Minimum wage job due to a back injury. I've fallen on some hard times, I have money in my saving account but, i'm saving it for renting a tux for my best friends wedding. Will pay it forward when i find a stable job
1807	False	a	Hey Reddit. I feel horrible for this, but here I am, asking for pizza. I've just moved from Alabama to Austin, Texas, in an attempt to change my life's direction and take charge of my student debt etc. To that end, I've gotten a job in Austin and am currently living on the floor in my own apartment (can't afford a bed). My check is coming on Friday, for three weeks' work at a big box retailer, but I haven't been able to afford food for four days, all my my remaining income going towards gas to get to/from work. Anyway, I would very much appreciate some kind of assistance, though I know you are in no way obligated to do so.   It'd totally make my week though. &lt;3
1808	False	a	Hungry...no money...i'll pay it forward.
1809	False	a	Due to some other expenses we are unfortunately a bit tight on funds!  My partner has recently dealt with some issues with alcoholism.  Not severe to the point where he needed rehab, but severe enough to where he's started strictly moderating his alcohol intake, and has recently joined a support group.   I'd love to reward his hard work with some pizza to celebrate.  He has found an amazing support group for others in his situation, which has been really helpful and encouraging.   We live very close to a Dominoes, Pizza Hut, and Papa Murphys.  I was hoping to score a $15 gift card, it would be enough to get a medium pizza with the works at any of these locations.  Papa murphys has always been his favorite.   I have also recently returned to work after becoming injured, my first paycheck is arriving on the 16th of September.  I definitely plan on paying it forward once I get paid.  We have a decent homeless population in the area and I've been couponing to get some care packages put together (bagged lunch, tooth brush, tooth paste, couple of wash cloths, baby wipes, reusable water bottle, notepad and pen, stuff like this) to give out.  Or I can pay it forward on here, pizza-buyers choice :)  I'll be doing the care packages either way, but I'll have an extra $X to put towards it :P
1810	False	a	yes my username is really new to reddit (but I'm not) and I don't have a sob story. (at least not one I want 2 post) I am however really in need of a pizza and would appreciate it if a wonderful RAOP redditor would buy me one and I will pay it forward next tuesday when I get paid. Just a nice guy looking for a break and a full tummy till I get paid. yes I can verify and I will PM u and U can PM me. Thanks for listening and looking at my post.

1813	False	a	Mother out of Tampa Florida with two beautiful girls who I would love to treat to a special pizza dinner this weekend. Can't really afford to do anything extravagant for my daughters so I was looking for help to put a smile on their face with their favorite food.
1814	False	a	Just this Monday (11/5/12), in fact had an interview with McDee that went no where and on Tuesday (11/6/12), gonna be going to Stater Brothers for their open interviews, I'm getting in a terrible head space about this.   I'd love some pizza to cheer me on or just maybe celebrate a new job at stater brothers.
1815	False	a	Hey, poor university student here...I have no food till friday until my paycheck comes in. If anyone could get me a pizza it would be much appreciated!
1816	False	a	Hi, my friend has been in the hospital for over and month. She's been fed terrible hospital food. I want to treat her with pizza so she has something to look forward too. Can someone please donate $20 dollars so we can share a decent meal. Thank you
1817	True	a	"My rent check, student loan payment, &amp; car payment all went through on the same day. Now I'm left with a -$103 account balance and the only thing to eat in my house is apples.  If anyone could be so kind as to pizza me, I would be much obliged. I will have access to funds come Monday, so I'll be able to survive until my paycheck on Friday.  Also, I promise I will pay it forward. When I get paid on Friday, I solomly swear that the first thing I'll do is pizza someone else in need.  Thank you!  **[edit] I've already been pizza'd by the gracious FrankReynolds. Just wanted to update this post, as my ""got pizza'd"" tag has yet to be applied.**"
1818	False	a	I just decided to take 21 credits this semester, which is an insane amount compared to the 12-15 I usually do.  I've been up since 5am doing the first two weeks of homework for as many of my classes as possible, which sadly has only been three.  I'm exhausted, and in the least self-entitled tone I can muster, I feel like I've earned a small pie.    Woo!  Oh yeah, and location: Arizooona!
1819	False	a	Haven't found a real job. Just graduated from Appalachian State University with a double major in Risk Management &amp; Insurance and Economics. Been eating Ramen Noodles for 2 days just ran out. Super broke looking for some delicious pizza. Favorite toppings are pepperoni and pineapple,but would be pumped for anything.
1820	False	a	im so sick of eating eggs all day. I wish i had some RAMEN to eat so i could combine if with my eggs. I'm completely broke and hungry. Starving college kid in need.
1821	False	a	Hey guys, so I started my summer courses and i've been trying to find a job but have had no luck so far. My money situation is looking kinda bad and I would really appreciate it if I could get a pizza to hold me off for the rest of the week. This is my first time so once I find a source of income I promise I'll fulfill someones request. Thank you so much!
1822	True	a	Will pay it forward and provide pictures of said delicious Pi(zza). Everyone enjoy the holiday
1823	True	a	So the situation is we've been running low on food the last couple of weeks and any cash we've had has been put immediately into the car for gas to get me back and forth to work in KC.  We have been cooking rice and canned things, but have not much left to last us the next few days.  So that my husband and daughter can eat full meals, I've been skipping breakfast and lunch this week and living on hot tea and chewing gum while at work.    It's normally not a big deal, and I can make it through the day fine, but today I'm already super-hungry and it's not even 11 am yet.  I get paid on Friday and will be able to re-stock our pantry then, but I am definitely feeling the empty hole in my tummy today.  I am thinking of going to Jimmy John's and begging for a day-old loaf of bread if they have any.  If anybody could find it in their heart to buy me a pizza today, I would be very happy, and it could last me the next few days of lunch at work until I get my check Friday afternoon.  I will even pay you back via paypal that evening after my check is deposited.  
1824	False	a	I've been unemployed for awhile. Not due to a lack of effort. I feel like I've hit rock bottom. I'm going on my second week eating dollar store oatmeal. My hormonal rage is making me crave something more. If anyone is in a giving mood, message me. I'd even be happy with a cheesy bread and little desserty thing.
1825	False	a	I homeschool my kids and they have a day off today. I call it a Mom in service day. Anyway, I would love to treat them to a pizza lunch but lack the funds to do so. A pizza lunch from a kind redditor would be great. Thanks if you can help.
1826	False	a	Hi I'm Ian.  I live with my mom and three siblings in LA. My parents recently got in a divorce and between all the legal fees, there's not a steady flow of money coming in. It would mean the world to me if I could help my mom out and surprise her with a pizza/dinner. I know she'd be happy. If anyone could help we would really appreciate it. 
1827	False	a	Broke art student looking for a meal. Hook a kid up please &lt;3
1828	False	a	Im in charlotte nc, just found out that the electricity company won't get around to my property to early next week, leaving no power for me n the kids until then. Was gracefully asking for a little help.
1829	False	a	So this is my first time requesting anything. I'm sorry if I don't understanding the formatting or the information I put.  After being away from my GF for nearly a month, I was finally able to come down and see her this weekend... but only for 2 days. It usually costs me a lot of money just for the trip so and I can't afford to spend money I don't have.  I am a big fan of paying it forward and promise to make an offer when I am able to. Thank you :)
1830	True	a	Well, I haven't eaten since yesterday when I ran out of food. So here is to hoping that today will be different. I live in Florida would really appreciate a pizza or gift card.   Thanks  
1831	False	a	I have a hunger only pizza can satisfy but I'm broke as a joke right now. You are AWESOME please help me out.. 
1832	False	a	Im 20 years old and living on my own in Texas. i work a crappy job for crappy pay. i finally saved just enough for this class so i can take it and make something of myself, because living like this is making me depressed to the point of mental breakdown. I live on ramen breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I gave my girlfriend my last pack this morning for her lunch at college. If there is anyone kind enough to help out I Promise that friday when i get that paycheck i will return the favor. i never ask anything from anyone unless i really need it but when i do, i always repay my debts.
1833	False	a	Just thought I'd give this a shot and see how it works. I live out near Boston, MA. I am a little sick of sustaining myself on ramen and pasta though so some pizza would be an amazing treat.
1834	True	a	Hey reddit, im basically feeling like crap right now. I have a history of falling for the wrong girls but this one really hurt. I took my girl  (soon to be ex I guess) to the movies and dropped her off since she said she had to be home early. After dropping her off I realized I had to go back and give her this small gift I had gotten her that I had forgotten about. That's when I found her getting in a car and when I got closer I saw her kissing some guy that wasn't really my friend but I did know him through mutual friends. I dont know what to do, im just gunna drink a bit (not an alcoholic or anything) but I need to relax, I wasnt really in love with her but I was getting there and im just bummed out, I actually spent all my money on the movies I took her to today, and now just starving, depressed, drinking and craving a damn pizza. That would be awesome, not really expecting a pizza but that would be awesome, just had to rant a bit sorry guys.  
1835	False	a	:)  What do you want a drawing of?  (I can even mail it to you if you want.)  Or what do you want me to write a poem about?    
1836	False	a	I have just about zero in the way of extra cash, recently shelled out a bunch to move, but cooking just seems like the most daunting task in the world right now with the kiddo so miserable.  I just need me a bacon and pineapple pizza to curl up with on the couch while I nurse the baby into a milk coma.  
1837	False	a	give a pizza to a deserving person that went thru the hurricane, i would myself but im broke myself and good thoughts are not enough to feed people, PLEASE help those who have nothing 
1838	False	a	No lie filled story. I'm hungry. And would love a pizza. I have made it easy.  https://order.zonicordering.com/MzYyNDY%3d.whtml?str=mountain-mikes-pizza-el-dorado-hills
1839	False	a	Please donate some pizza to occupy SD at the civic center. There is a lot of people here who can use a meal. Many of the protesterw are people who have lost their jobs and have been laid off. It would be great to get some delicious pies for the hUngry mouths. 
1840	False	a	I live in The Sacramento Area in California. My husband decided now is the time to cheat which is wonderful as I am pregnant so I have been reading this and it has made me both cry and smile as people are so kind here. I hate to ask but figure it is worth a try. Nothing to lose by taking the time to fill out a simple message, but I admit I am new to this. I have been lurking now for a year and finally broke down and made an account for advice.  So I will just put it out there, I am in the foothills so it is a half hour to get pizza but I will gladly make the drive if someone would help with the pie. I will be getting some financial help from my folks hopefully in the next few weeks and will pay it forward as soon as I can. If anyone can help me we have Round Table and Domino's or Mountain Mikes. I am not choosy :) Thank you for any help. I do have a verification code if that is helpful.  edit; Tried to edit for spacing it would not allow. My apologies. EDIT; Spaced correctly after being told how to do correctly! Thanks Nolanoscopy.
1841	False	a	I'm sure I can talk the hospital into making me only pay a fraction of the cost, but it's a bit of a downer as it still will wind up being at least a 1/10th of what I make a year.  Anyway, if someone is up for tossing me a bit of a pick me u I'm in Elkhart, IN and I'd be very appreciative. Otherwise, I have cans of soup and some saltines.  (Not sure if I have to post proof or something. I'll see if I can get my scanner to work in the mean time)  edit: Page one of 3 from my insurance denying my claims.  http://imgur.com/TxnX2
1842	False	a	I will soon be going on a long deployment which I'm not aloud to discuss but willing to give some info if you ask. Just wanna eat some of the stuff America has to offer before I leave for a long time to Afganistan.
1843	False	a	Planning a cross-country move in a week (Davison, Michigan to Maine), but currently broke and living on ramen and occasionally my roommates' leftovers. I would seriously appreciate a break from that, even a small one. There's a Pizza Hut and a Hungry Howie's (Michigan chain) near me that both do online ordering, and they're about the same price but only Pizza Hut does gift cards, so I'm not quite sure how to go about it. I've only gotta feed myself, so I don't necessarily need much. I can try to pay you back, if you don't mind it possibly taking a while- I'm moving to look for a job.   P.S. If either of my roommates see this: Hey guys look, there's a subreddit for this!
1844	True	a	I am serving my second AmeriCorps term in Denver, CO.  My food stamp case was recently closed because they send the follow-up paperwork to my previous address despite me calling and updating my address when I moved.  It will take approximately a month to go through the process again and receive food stamps.  If you're familiar with AmeriCorps, you know we serve nonprofit organizations for a very, very small monthly stipend.  Any assistance would be appreciated from the bottom of my heart!  TL;DR: Food stamps taken away through no fault of my own and I could use the help!
1845	False	a	Boyfriend broke up with me and There is nothing to eat at my house.
1846	True	a	"Before I start, allow me to say that I do realize that I am new here. I am not someone who is out to score a free meal, I am honestly looking for some help right now.  OK so here is my story. I apologize in advance for the giant wall-of-text.  A couple of months ago our ceiling caved in, due to excessive rain and the landlord's refusal to fix the leak. We had been telling him for months that it was not fixed and it was still leaking, but he didn't care.  So the night that the ceiling caved in, I called the landlord and I told him politely, ""hey, your ceiling just fell in on us""  His exact words, were ""I don't really give a damn, I don't care about anything since you said you don't owe me any money""  Now this is funny, because for years this landlord would come around EVERY YEAR at tax time, and insist we owed him some insane amount of money. We had just been agreeing in the past, because it was possible we might have missed some payments here or there.  But this time was different. He claimed we owed him 3,400 dollars for 8 months of rent that we supposedly never paid him. So I tell him, give me the dates that you think we didn't pay, and I will run them against my receipts and see what's going on.  Well, when I finally get the dates, I cross-reference them to my receipts. And it turned out that we had actually OVER-PAID the landlord by 750 dollars - plus we had all the paperwork to prove it.  So I try to explain the situation with the guy, and he refuses to listen. So he files an eviction.  We go to court with photographs of the ceiling caved in that he refused to fix, the stack of receipts, his dates that he claimed we never paid - EVERYTHING.  Well the judge's exact words were ""I'm not too good with numbers, so we aren't going to get in to your stack of receipts""  The landlord also claimed that he never got the money orders, so I contacted Western Union, and I had them send me the front AND backs of them to show who they were made out to, and who signed and cashed them. Even after seeing these, he STILL claimed in front of the judge that he never got them - But they were clearly signed by him!!!  So the judge gave us 72 hours to get our shit and get out, when we were legally paid up for another 2 months........  So I had to spend 200 dollars on a storage unit, and we packed our entire lives into it. At this point, we are literally homeless. So I get a hotel room for myself, my fiancee, and our chocolate lab for the next week, just to have somewhere to sleep at night.  So that's another 200 dollars gone when we were actually paid up on the apartment and were wrongfully evicted.  After about 4 days in the hotel, we came in contact with the lady we are renting from now - she had a house available, this house - But it's 500 dollars/month for rent, plus utility costs...  Either way, we can't live out of a hotel at 200 dollars per week. So we agree and move in.  The house doesn't have a refrigerator, it doesn't have a washer/dryer. So we lived out of a cooler for the first month that we got here, until we were able to buy a cheap 75 dollar refrigerator.  This story just keeps going on &amp; on &amp; on.. I honestly couldn't type this whole thing out unless I wrote for a month.. This whole situation has just been insane.  Bottom line, I hate to ask for help. Especially like this..   But I do have photos of the entire process. From moving our things into storage to us living out of the hotel room, all the way up until we found this house, to today's rent payment.. I have the photos.. I have the receipts, I have everything...  So, the reason I am asking today is because we just spent our last 500 dollars that we had in the bank on the rent for the next month.  Neither of us gets paid for another 2 weeks.  If anyone can afford like 20 dollars or something so I could surprise her when she gets home from work with a pizza, some cheese sticks and a 2 liter of pepsi, that would be awesome.   As far as proof goes, I can provide a scanned copy of the money order for the rent that I just sent out today, it was our last drop of money. (After we were evicted illegally, I now scan the front of the money order before sending them to prove who they were made out to if any disputes should ever come up.)  I would of course blank the recipient's name out, along with the address. But I would highlight the date it was purchased (today) so you can see that I'm not just making up some sob story. I couldn't make this shit up if I tried...  So anyway, again I apologize for the huge wall of text. If someone can help us, I deeply appreciate it and thank you in advance. If not, well at least I tried. It's better to try and fail, than not try and wonder what may have happened.  EDIT: To make it easier for people who are interested in possibly helping, I have blanked-out the money order and uploaded it.   You can see it here: http://tinypic.com/r/25evg55/7  EDIT EDIT: ThumpingArnt helped me already, thank you so much.. I'm speechless right now.. "
1847	False	a	Okay no really, we're just hungry and we don't have any cash.  If we should receive a pizza we will pass it on soon!
1848	False	a	Hey there. I have no money on me and I would like to have a Pizza, preferably with mushrooms on it. It'd be nice.   Location: High Point, NC.
1849	True	a	Long story short i'm broke and unemployed at the moment so I can't take my mom out like she deserves.
1850	False	a	Ordered 2 NFL football jerseys and like any hardcore fan, I was jubilant at the thought of finally wearing my team jerseys with pride! That is...until they were stolen off my porch after being delivered. I'm really bummed because they were quite a bit of money (for me at least). A pizza would help alleviate the problem a little. 
1851	False	a	My '99 Jeep Cherokee I've had for 10 years now was stolen today.  I've got little cash as it is and no mode of transportation.  A pizza would be fantastic tonight.
1852	False	a	I will owe you the world. Thanks.
1853	False	a	Our rabbit, Bugs got sick.  He lost 30% of his body weight and as a result his temperature also dropped a whopping 8 degrees F below normal.   We spent somewhere over $100 on his initial vet bill, Critical Care (this oatmeal like grain food to have him gain weight), hot pack, hot water bottle, space heater, and an extra amount of his favorite veggies.  I also work 2 hours away (seasonal position, I basically just get work whenever I tell my boss I'll be in town) and had to cancel my shifts for tomorrow and Sunday.  My boyfriend has missed work to care for him, and I've missed school so I'm also way behind.    He needs 24 hour care so we're taking turns sleeping and watching him, and both of us are never out of the house at the same time.  He's eating more, we're keeping his temperature consistent, but he's not gaining any weight.  His mate died a few months ago, so we think that's why he stopped eating.  This is taking every bit of our energy.    If he doesn't start gaining weight soon, he'll need blood tests, stool sample tests, and a couple others along with an increased dose of Critical Care, an antibiotic, and a probiotic.  The estimate from the vet was just over $400, so we're cutting corners everywhere we can.  Keep in mind, that money doesn't count for the extra veggies from the grocery store (our rabbits always get fresh veggies, but since Bugs is now refusing timothy hay, which is supposed to take up a large majority of his diet) we're having to buy, which is going to add up over the next few weeks, possibly longer if he continues to ignore his hay.     So, if you've made it this far, I'm just asking for a pizza, or pasta, or something from Pizza Hut, Dominoes, or Black Jack (those are the closest places to us).  If you have a random gift card for *any* restaurant in the Tucson area, we'll be grateful for that too/instead.  Anything to keep us from Ramen would be so appreciated.     **TL;DR** Our rabbit is incredibly sick, and we've already spent just approximately $131 on his special care, not including the extra veggies.  This was our grocery budget until the next paycheck comes in, and we've both had to miss work to stay and care for him since he needs literally 24/7 monitoring.  The vet gave us an estimate of $400 for extra tests he could need if his condition doesn't improve.  After we run out of the food in the house, we're going to be on ramen for at least 2 weeks, possibly a month or longer until he gets better.  Pizza wold be wonderful.
1854	False	a	I'm not really in a dire situation or anything at the moment, just mildly depressed at recent life events and waiting around until tonight when my brother (and only roommate) gets home from work and we can go grocery shopping.  Wish my car would get fixed already, so I wouldn't be stranded like this!  Unfortunately, we delayed this food run a little too long, and have run out of basically everything edible besides about a dozen apples and some eggs.  lol.  So yeah, I've been eating nothing but apples since I woke up about four hours ago.  Why are these things so unfulfilling?!  Anyway, I was talking about my situation in an irc channel and someone linked me this.  I've read reddit here and there, but never actually took the initiative to get an account or post anything.  But hey, nothing wrong with giving it a shot I guess.  Not sure what exactly I can give for verification, if you guys would like any.  I assume you would, with me being a newly signed up member.  If you feel like throwing a pick me up my way, just let me know what I can do.  Oh, I should probably note that I live in Vegas.
1855	False	a	So where he works he somehow got free pizza for dinner and texted me I was on my own. I told him to bring me some and he said he can't...they ate it all. :(  I'm in Sherwood Arkansas and thought I might give this a try. Think it might make him laugh if I get a pizza too. :)   EDIT: Ok cancel this request. A friend called me and if going to take me out to dinner. :)
1856	True	a	I finished my last box of cereal for lunch, all I have left is olive oil. I would greatly appreciate a pizza, I need something to last me till Sunday!
1857	False	a	Just lost a beloved family pet -- heroic last efforts at saving her cost a bundle and we had just had to front first/last/deposit on a new place. Out of funds, out of food, miss our dog, could use a pizza. :(
1858	False	a	I am a single mother of three who is attending school full time and working part time.  I just applied for food stamps and it will be about three weeks before it comes in.  I do not have a car so I have no way to get to the food pantry that my kids school suggested. I don't get paid until next friday and am really really craving pizza.  (I don't have all the ingredients to make my own) 
1859	False	a	Until payday on Friday, the only food I have in the house is white rice, and my checking account is in the red. Some pizza would really help me stretch out the week.
1860	True	a	I don't get paid until next week, and there's nothing but cereal and eggs left in the house. Not really in the mood for either of those for dinner, so a pizza would really be appreciated, thanks!
1861	True	a	don't get my check until tuesday evening, a pizza or 2 plus the food we have left here should last til then when im able to get groceries. id ask my parents but i dont want them knowin im in this shitty situation. im goin back to school in the fall so hopefully that will open up more opportunities for us. if someone is fortunate enough to lend some help, id be ecstatic and my son, most importantly, would definitely be as well. message me for verification!!
1862	False	a	I got an inner ear infection three weeks ago, and the vertigo is bad enough that I can't work. I'm a college student and I'm quickly running out of Ramen, hoping I can get to work again before the rent is due. If someone wants to send me a pizza or come hang out (Bozeman, MT) that would be awesome!
1863	True	a	So I'm a broke college student (big surprise!) who couldn't go home for Thanksgiving. All my housemates went home, and all my friends went home as well/had other plans, so it looks like I'm spending the next 4 days alone. I would really appreciate not having to eat mac&amp;cheese for the umpteenth time, especially on this day.
1864	False	a	I really miss my best friend Brittney and I don't get to talk to her much since I am a full time student, have a 2 year old and work full time. I would love for her to know how much I miss her! 
1865	False	a	Hello, I'm new to this subbreddit and I'm not exactly sure how this works. Essentially, I'm a broke college student with classes starting this Tuesday. I would like to get pizza for my family tonight just to be nice, but I can't afford it with the cost of books. 3/5 people in my family have celiac disease and cannot have regular pizza without doing serious damage to their body. 
1866	False	a	I'm in the US. I'd really appreciate a pizza if anyone is willing. Ramen mixed with vegetables can only taste good for so long. Thanks!
1867	False	a	It would be much appreciated.
1868	False	a	We're not actually starving, but we don't have any food or money. My measly paycheck ran out already and with bills and upcoming birthday, we didn't have a lot of money for groceries. Haven't had pizza in a while!
1869	False	a	So broke:(I'm from vista,CA moving to Boston in about a week, but I seriously have no money and have to figure out how I'm gonna get by until then. I don't really have any friends to help me out otherwise I wouldn't be so flipping hungry!!!      I hate asking favors but if there's anyone out there who could help a brother out, I would be eternally grateful! As a sign of good faith I will even make an art piece dedicated to my pizza 
1870	False	a	Hey Reddit, me and my mate here are hungry as ever and my birthday is today. My mate would buy me Pizza but he doesn't get paid till next week. Will pay you back. Thanks for reading guys :)
1871	True	a	Well the ticket is IMO total bs (it looks like I come to a full stop to me in the little grainy video) but I have to pay it, according to the ticket I did not come to a complete stop while making a right on red. Pretty crappy mood about it and was poor before having to pay it. Pizza is my comfort food. Also there's that email from PJ's that says if I order more than $10 I'll get 25 papa points, that would make this week not so shitty. I thank anyone for considering my request.
1872	False	a	I just started college this week, it is my first time away from home.  Needless to say that things are not as easy as i thought they would be:(.  I have been bumming off friends for lunch this week. I would like to return a small favor to them after our test Monday. Someone please help me!
1873	False	a	AMAA, first time.
1874	False	a	Well, I finished up college and I'm back home now, unemployed, and the whole house is going through a really rough time. Little to no food, hard to pay bills, hardly even any toilet paper. I've never been one to ask for things really, and I don't even want to now, but it's gotten to the point where it's sort've needed. I'm headed to the food bank at a local church in hopes of getting some food, but I just figured this would be worth a shot.       I don't really expect anything, but it'd be awesome if something did happen.       I don't particularly have any skills... or else I'd draw some pictures or some shit. But I do have $5 on my Steam Account, so if someone would like, I'll gift them a game? Idk. 
1875	True	a	I try not to resort to asking people for help, but I can't stand ramen anymore...   I am trying to learn photoshop, so I can try to do some small tasks to pay you back.  
1876	True	a	My fiancee and I are waiting for our paydays in a few days (woohoo, her first one in a while!) and we're both working tomorrow. As money is kinda short right now, we'd love it if someone would treat us to pizza tonight so we could go to work tomorrow with memories of delicious, delicious noms. And, we'll be more than happy to reciprocate!
1877	False	a	Yeah, my parents are both unemployed and we never ever can afford to actually buy a luxury like pizza. All we have are pantry items, like peas and some cereal. Nothing really good. Haven't had pizza in forever, and i havent eaten for awhile because my sister ate the last of the cereal and the rest of the food is diet food for my mom. All i have, is some little snacks, like grapes. I can draw a pretty picture for you, and put your name on it! (: i can video tape me doing some corny jokes/pickup lines. Willing to do close to anything, im sooo hungry. Im in santa fe springs, california. 
1878	False	a	Hey guys, long time lurker who wishes she could contribute but never has the money. :( Hoping someone out there can ease the wait to get my school refund with a nice hot pizza. I'm in the Winter Park area of Orlando, any other details will be provided via private message. Thank you for those that read this, even if you do not contribute. 
1879	True	a	Any help would be appreciated, and reciprocated when I get paid in 2 weeks!
1880	False	a	List of things I will do for a pizza.  1. Anything I would do for a klondike bar 2. upvote anything you want me to 3. send an email to your ex gf/bf telling them to fuck off. 4. thank you alot. 5. be your friend. 6. eat the pizza. 7. enjoy the pizza. 8. BE the pizza.
1881	False	a	I've never done this before, but between today, registering for classes for my return to school for the first time in 3 years...it's been an extremely long day. I'd love to swing by Pizza Hut on the way home.  Thanks, guys.  **Edit:** Oops. North Carolina, USA here!  **Edit 2:** Well it's quitting time, so I'll revoke my pizza request until another time.
1882	False	a	So, well. My girlfriend and I are 20, and 22 years old respectively. We decided to follow our dreams of creating a digital marketing/design firm about a year and a half ago. The road has been long and hard, we slept on my father's couch in a trailer for 6 months, a dank basement (on the floor) with people who didn't really want us there for the last 9, sometimes living off ramen as we all have to sometimes.  But here we are, on the advent of our success, and Christopher Columbus messes it up. We have a large check coming in the mail, but we didn't get it today because of the holiday. We are currently staying in a Motel 6 for a week, to scout/establish places to live, as we FINALLY after a year and a half of hard work, destitution, doubt and confidence, and above all courage, enough money to get (and keep) ourselves afloat, and enough clientele to support us through the months.  We're getting an apartment with the money that's coming in (and of course food), but we had planned on renting a single bed motel room for a week for $259, which would've left us with more than enough for simple groceries. They only had a 2 bed avaliable, for about $290. We only had about $310 in cash at that point, so needless to say that the remainder of the money is gone, and we were reliant on that check coming in today to be able to eat. Christopher Columbus! Note, we have NO where else to stay besides outside, no family, nothing.  We haven't ate a meal in around 30 hours, and while we've gone much, much longer before (box of cheerios and a bag of Ore Ida fries for a week... lol) , we just really don't want to go through the slow agony of starving again, especially when we're so on the cusp of being self reliant.  So I ask if there's any kind soul out there that would bless us with a pizza tonight, with the full intention of us paying you back within the next few days if wanted. We have a LOT of work to do, and not eating for an entire day isn't exactly great on your concentration, especially when dealing with tedious stuff like coding.  Proof avaliable if needed :) thanks!
1883	False	a	I'm a Georgetown student, and I have an orgo exam tonight. I'd sure love a pizza to help dry my tears when I'm done with it.
1884	True	a	it has been a very hard pay period for me and my family and dinner for tonight would be greatly appreciated. I will gladly pay it foward on friday if someone can take care f of me today. thanks
1885	False	a	Forgot to put in the Title, Manchester UK here, sorry.  Here's a link to a reddit post I made the other day, people in the thread said I should try here If I need help www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/18bit1/fiancee_of_2_years_just_left_me_when_i_was_out/  EDIT: I'll pay it forward when I can, big time believer of Today you, Tomorrow me
1886	False	a	Studying for the Delaware bar exam which starts on Monday.  Haven't really left my room at all in a week.  Completely broke because I don't have a job until I start work, and all I have left in the fridge are some eggs.  Would love a random act of pizza.
1887	False	a	First time pizza poster- [NYC AREA] So I spent a good hour cutting  fresh chicken breasts, brushing egg yolk on them, some flour, a lot of bread crumbs and deep frying them to deliciousness. Tried to eat them with my girlfriend while studying for biology in our tiny apartment and boom- plate falls on the floor. Oh, and I also lost my Playstation 3 to a bunch of Frat boys who threw a party with my roomate who by accident spilled an entire cup of alcohol into the top vent. shitty, shitty 48 hours its been. =/ needless to say- low on cash and virtually no food in the fridge. Heres a picture of one of the plates   http://imgur.com/wLsKh   Oh and also, I want to state that my girlfriend does not believe at all this sub reddit exists and that random people actually send pizza to strangers -randomly.   TL;DR- Shitty 48 hours, home made chicken fingers fell on the floor. starving. Tummy feels sad.
1888	False	a	I'm poor and could really use a pie, simple as that.
1889	False	a	Hey, lets just throw some info out here first, im 16 and dont live with my father and am going to meet my mother next month, and i currently have no money and no food and i have a MAAAAD craving for some pizza.  So if someone would give me a random act of pizza before im homeless it would be much appreciated and i would give just as much back to the board when everything is stabilized again. Thanks in advance, even if you dont.   *Edit* Also, i live in Ontario Canada if that helps any.
1890	False	a	So I'm desperate... I lost my job last week after my boss found out I was moving when the semester ends. Being an idiot, I didn't have very much money saved up. So now I'm really hungry, and have no food, or money. I'll pay it forward when I find work again.  Update: Chaosmosis came through and is just so many kinds of awesome!
1891	False	a	Hi all, thanks for taking the time to even look at a request on here.  So the story is I've been unemployed since I got out of the Air Force and doing pretty okay without unemployment benefits. But I've started my new job and its a 20 mile drive both ways and not exactly conducive to my 50 dollar a week income from selling plasma. To top it off, today I was moved to a 8-5 shift and couldn't make it in time to donate due to traffic.  I won't get paid until next Friday, which will be kind of a stretch. Not looking for anything major, just hoping for a nice random act to keep me full until tomorrow afternoon.  And I guess to guilt you guys a bit, my new job is providing network support to literally EVERY Army hospital in the world and keeping their gears turning. To say the least, it is stressful.  But that's that, thought I might try one of these. Thanks for reading :D
1892	False	a	I posted in the other subreddit but though I'd try here too.   Hi reddit. This is my first time ever doing something like this but here I go.  I am requesting a pizza to feed two adults in Westminster MD. My fianc√© and i are behind because I broke my ankle in July and have been out of work since because the break required extensive surgery. All pizza chains are equally distant and would require us to pick up.  My fianc√© doesn't get paid until next Friday and his parents can only help so much, mostly with money for utilities and prescriptions for both of us. We have maybe $20 to our name and he has a full work schedule next week as well as having to take me to a follow up appointment with my surgeon on Monday, who is located a thirty minute drive away.  We've been eating a lot of PBJs and ramen and our ramen is running out so a pizza could really help out a lot. When we have gotten two pizzas in the past,they have lasted us for three-four days.  Thanks for your consideration and time reading this.  ETA : I do have a verification code for this sub. :)   Edit: pizza received. Thanks so much mcpeepants34!
1893	False	a	This may be the roughest spot I've ever been in. I have no money and will not have any left over after paying bills with my next paycheck. I don't like asking for help but I'm desperate. I would be so grateful to anyone who could help out, even in a very small way.  
1894	True	a	Not having a great time during my first day on reddit, or a great birthday.  A pizza probably wouldn't help, but I could use a pick me up. location: University of Michigan.  received: from tanyagal2
1895	False	a	Today is my Twins 5th birthday today, I couldn't afford to get them any presents with my situation right now. A friend suggested I check out this site. My Kidslove pizza, we are at the library right now hoping that someone can help get us some pizza. Mama bear will repay back any help that we get, as soon as I can. We are new to Reddit and Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, but have a feeling that we will be giving a lot once mama bear gets backs on her feet. We will offer drawings of pizza, or anything that you like in return for this awesome bday gift.   Love _ Mama Bear and Her 2 Lil Cubs, Brantley and Brianna
1896	False	a	Hey guys - my stomach has been meat/fish/animal free for 6 months. I used to crush pepperoni pizza like it was nothing. Ever since I've been doing the vegetarian thing, I haven't had any sort of pizza whatsoever.  So I'm asking if anyone can hook me up with a delicious vegetarian friendly pizza. I'd be forever grateful. (LA, West Hollywood)
1897	False	a	3 dudes, recently moved to Austin to chase the dream.  Making rent our first month has totally tapped the funds.  All have just started work and are trying our damndest to stick it out until the first round of pay checks.  Any help is much appreciated!  Thanks and be excellent to each other!
1898	False	a	wallets empty, plus finals and wrapping up the final week at my internship...i would really appreciate a nice fresh steaming triangle of cheese at this moment in time.  cheers  
1899	False	a	Currently down on my luck, I'm unemployed, my cable got shut off yesterday and recently got dumped by my girlfriend. It's a Tuesdy evening and I'd love some pizza, what girl wouldn't? Anyone like to help me out? Sitting alone in my room with just my stomach growling to keep me company :(  Oh and I'm located in WA state
1900	False	a	I don't have a steady job right now and I've been doing odd jobs to get by. I'm home alone for the next month by myself because my dad is traveling for company who hired him for a month of solid work which is awesome and my mom is away visiting her mom. I've been doing everything I can to make some money recently because I'm trying to visit my girlfriend who is down in Florida right now. I'm planning to go out and see her just after my birthday on the 27th and need to have as much as possible to be able to stay in a hotel (where she is staying you're not allowed to have guests overnight) and to eat and pay for the plane ticket back. So, I ask you Random Acts of Pizza, could you spare a few dollars for a pizza for an early birthday present?  Here is a photo of me and my refrigerator: http://imgur.com/35cpf  Feel free to ask me anything and I will definitely take pictures to thank you for the pizza! 
1901	True	a	Hello pizza friends,  I'm a UK postgraduate student who's been putting in long hours into her PhD and is getting a mighty craving for a pizza. Unfortunately, I only get paid every four months, and I'm at the end of a pay period so money is very tight.  As my payday is Monday, I intend to pay it forward and send some hungry redditor a pie once the money hits my account.  Additionally, if you feed me, I'll send you a picture of my very cute pet rabbit, being cute. Deal?  Thank you very much!
1902	True	a	I don't have much to offer but if you can help me out I'll owe you big. My stomach is growling I have some water and about 2 dollars in change. This pizza would last me a few days until my check comes in. 
1903	False	a	Hey all, I found this subreddit the other day and I think it's both hilarious and awesome what goes on here, and I want to participate.   After months of searching, I received a conditional offer of employment today! I'm very excited to start, but I still have some hoops to get through before I do (the conditions being a background check and drug test, both of which are all clean, so I'm not worried).   Seeing as how I'm currently a broke college student, pizza is an awesome celebratory food, but I can't really afford it until I start the job. If someone would hook me up with a pizza now, then once I get my first paycheck I would gladly buy them a pizza, or I could pay it forward to someone else listing a request.  I'd also like to make this interesting. I request that the kind, obviously good looking person who does this for me get me their own personal favorite pizza. There are no pizzas I've tried that I don't like, so don't be afraid I won't enjoy it. I promise I will. Or just troll me with the craziest franken-pizza you can design. I think that would be fun too.  EDIT: I'm located in Central Florida
1904	False	a	I would greatly appreciate a pizza tonight :) I can pay it forward on the 28th as that is when I get paid again. Sorry if that makes the title misleading...I just like Popeye :)
1905	False	a	I just recently took a job opportunity, and finished out my two weeks at my previous employers. The overlap in training has left me with no money for my bills, my brother's wedding, or food. I'm kind of struggling and just seeing if anyone would like to lend a hand. I have lurked here for a while and will certainly pay the favor forward as soon as I get on my feet at the new job. Atlanta, GA,USA here
1906	False	a	For real. I'm out of food and more than a little hung over and all I have done today is kill a stupid red dragon in Demon's Souls.
1907	False	a	Like title says my birthday is the 26th this month but I don;t have anything at all for me or my 5 year old to eat for dinner tonight. Was wondering if someone could help us out with a pizza to get us by til i get paid on my Bday friday? I'd be glad to pay it forward, thanks so much!
1908	False	a	So its pretty much what I stated in my title. I'm a relatively poor college kid making a living on Ebay buying/selling/refurbishing iPhones and other electronics. This month didn't go so well and I don't have money until my next paypal payment is processed. (Can provide proof of this)  In return I can fix/root/upgrade/whatever your cell phone or other personal electronic or draw you a really bad picture! I could also be your lane-mate in Dota 2 (I play a mean Omniknight)  If you can't give pizza an internet high five would also do the trick!
1909	False	a	Lost my Job three months ago. Since then I've bought nothing but pasta. I got told today that all I need to do is go down tomorrow to fill out paperwork to get setup, but today I have 3 dollars in my bank. Anyone wanna buy a pizza for a guy to celebrate with something other than water and beef top ramen since I won't be paid for another 3 weeks yet?
1910	False	a	He lives in Jackson, MI. I'm kind of new to the whole pizza offers, so if you need anything else just ask.
1911	False	a	Hi everyone I am on here in hopes to getting a pizza my hubby just got home from work and we are both broke till tomorrow.and we are pretty empty on food in our home.would be nice to have a nice hot pizza for our late dinner pls.Thanks ...
1912	False	a	"Hey Reddit! I'm an RA at one of the colleges in Burlington, VT. I have an event with my dorm tonight, and unfortunately I'm a little low on cash. My plan was to get some residents together, do some team building activities, and then play Apples to Apples to blow off some steam from midterms.  Sadly, I usually need some form of food to help lure these kids in to take part in my reindeer games. Since I'm low on money until payday on Friday, I was hoping one of you lovely people could spot me a pizza. It's a small dorm, and anything would help. I'm not sure how promising to repay a pizza works here, but I'll hit you back with some money to one of ""the big three"" whenever you need it :]  Help some hungry college kids out, please?"
1913	False	a	I'm not going to lie about my economic situation, I can afford a pizza. If anyone would like to brighten an intern's day, SEND SOME PIZZA THISA WAY.     (rhymes for pizza?) 
1914	True	a	Times are really tough, I am a high-school chemistry teacher and dont know how much longer I will live. I just need to throw a pizza on my roof in frustration one more time before I die. Please help, also my son has a disability. Junior loves breakfast, but pizza will be fine. God bless. 
1915	False	a	parents have 3 small dogs and wont let me move back home from college with my pitbull :( sad times.  
1916	False	a	I'm 9 months pregnant, very tired, and very uncomfortable.  I'm craving a pizza really badly tonight, but am broke at the moment.  If anyone's feeling generous tonight I would appreciate it so much!  Thanks! http://i.imgur.com/E8mad.jpg
1917	True	a	My husband and I are buying our first new car today.  We are not in dire straights by any means, but buying a new car is definitely putting a huge dent in our wallets.  I would like to surprise my husband tonight with a celebratory pizza that didn't put any extra strain on our bank account.  The car payments over the next 5 years will being doing enough of that.  Thank you!
1918	False	a	basically i have $16 to last me the next week. i don't have enough gas to get home. i get paid on the 2nd and will return the favor!
1919	False	a	So here's the scoop ‚Äî I have a few ingredients from which I might be able to pull together a meal. However, I am working on deadline right now trying to get a business off the ground. I'm hungry as hell but I don't have time to get creative in the kitchen, I'll be working til after midnight at least as it is.  Pizza delivery would solve my time and hunger issues however I won't have any money until tomorrow night (11/27).  Anyone care to spot me a pizza? I can pay it forward (or back) in about a week if you wish. (Possibly as long as 2 weeks, but probably not that long)  I'm a longtime redditor, this is my regular Reddit account, I have a spankin' new verification code, and I have a record of repayment over at r/assistance though I only asked there once.  If you spot me a pizza, I'll sing a song for you and post a link to the mp3! (After deadline which means, tomorrow night)
1920	True	a	~~~I have no income whatsoever, and my husband is on SSI, paying for my rent and his on a fixed income. With bills and rent, we come out with $8 total for the rest of the month. My food card does not come in till the 9th, and we may not have enough food to last until then. A pizza would greatly lift our spirits, and if someone did donate one, once I have an income again we would be glad to do the same in return. We've already been trolled once today, please don't get our hopes down a second time..~~~  EDIT: Many, MANY thanks to SarTim, it is SO wonderful to know there are kind people in the world. Thank you!
1921	False	a	Just finished the last of my exams recently and while looking for full time employment could use some pizza :] .   Made a throw away account so friends and family don't realize how broke I am atm but I am willing to provide my real account via pm. Of course I shall repay the favor to the person or just put up a contest later on for a pizza once I begin working again :].   Anything is appreciated. Thank you for your time 
1922	False	a	My friend has been so kind to me and i want to Buy him a pizza but i'm a little short on cash and was wondering if anyone would be so kind to buy him a pizza. This is my first time on RAOP So please tell me if i'm doing any thing wrong.  Come on! Some one has to send him a pizza!!!!
1923	True	a	Thanks for taking the time to read this. I've been craving my favortie pizza (chicken and jalapeno with white sauce) for a while, but money just seems to go to bills or paying my mother back for money she lends me if things get too tight. Again thanks for even considering.
1924	False	a	Been eating ramen the past few days seeing if this would work, would truly be appreciated.   
1925	False	a	Hi, /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza! I just moved in to my first ever apartment a week or two ago, and now that everything's mostly settled I'm out of all foods but bacon and tortillas for the next week. Bacon tacos are tasty and everything, but a pizza would be an awesome alternative. :D
1926	True	a	So The next quarter of school starts monday, and I get my next financial aid check on tuesday. My bank account however is at 1.83. Im not starving, but whats left in my house till tuesday is PB&amp;J, top ramen, bagged salad and brown rice. A pizza would really break up the monotony of what ive been eating since about sunday. If this request is answered, however much a person would gift me I will pay forward with interest to someone when my check goes in next week. Thank you for your time.
1927	True	a	Yeah, just the usual I'm afraid. Broke, payday isn't for a few more days and what little money I do have is going into basic necessities.
1928	False	a	Well, my boyfriend and I have spent an inordinate amount of money this month on unexpected stuff. My laptop stopped working, and I had to spend the majority of my meager savings on a new one. Our hedgehog got sick and vet bills also took a good chunk of money from us. The only things we have left to eat are grits, eggs, and rice, and while it's enough to live on for now, I'm tired of eating it. Just one pizza would be great, I'm not picky about where it's from. Thanks to anyone who reads this.
1929	False	a	So, me and the fam will be having sandwiches for dinner tonight- no big but I'd like to surprise them with something a little more pizza'ie.  Problem is- I don't get paid till Friday. Yikes, right? So, what do you think we trade pizza favors? One for today, for one for you this coming weekend or when ever (hold it over my head like a mob boss, good conversation point).
1930	False	a	Hey Reddit                    Mr.Plainview here forgot my damn passowrd so i had to make a new account im sorry. anyway i was wondering if somebody could help me out. im hungry all i have is a bunch of crap ive been living off of for about 2 weeks now and i feel like its time for a little change. i sadly have bills coming up in 4 days so i cant spend any money right now. but i get paid on the 2nd of september and f anyone can help me out buying this GA boy a pizza i can return the favor when i get paid. thank you reddit                       -your old pal                                  mr plainview
1931	True	a	My wife and I just started back working in the schools.  We are a bit low on funds from having summer break and not getting paid.  Want to celebrate our first week back with style.  Nothing says style like cheesy goodness.  
1932	False	a	I just got fired from my job as a guitar teacher at a school and feel like shit, if anyone would be nice enough to send me a pizza it will make my week
1933	False	a	"Hello RoaP! I just want to go into a small amount of detail in this post and tell you guys how much we're in love. I will keep this post as appropriate as possible for the amount of detail I'll be going in to.   I was with my girlfriend on her 18th birthday and she really wanted to go down to the arcade. We're a new couple, so of course I'm trying to look cool in front of her so I say something along the lines of ""Alright, if you really want to,"" when really I wanted to shout at the top of my excitement ""ARE YOU SURE IT'S YOU'RE BIRTHDAY AND NOT MINE BECAUSE I LOVE THE ARCADE, WOOOOO--""   So we're at the arcade playing these goofy silly games, like the game where you put a quarter in and you watch your quarter go down into a pile of quarters and there is a metal bar that just might push more quarters down into the prize pit and ANYWAY, we're having fun.   So she eventually has to go to the little girl's room and she forgets to bring her phone. I took her phone and started counting up our tickets when all of a sudden her phone gets a text and a picture of her best friend's face pops up on the screen. I don't like to go through other peoples texts, but I see the word ""Tony"" before I put the phone back in my pocket, which is my first name. So I read just the 1 text. It states: ""Tony better remember what you asked for last week."" My stomach got this twisted feeling of ""oh crap how could I forget.""    !!!!!    JUST THEN --- A pizza delivery guy from the pizza place right next door is walking out to his car about to leave, so I rush him and scream ""hey wait!"". I ask him what kind of pizza, how much was it, and paid him in full plus a 10$ tip. I asked him to hold the pizza for a minute, and ran across the street to the joke shop and bought a gag sausage (don't ask me why there was one there, I wasn't paying attention at the time.)   I took the gag sausage back to the pizza, took out my pocket knife, and cut up a slice small enough to look similar to a pepperoni. Next, I took a pen and paper and wrote a note and pinned it down with a candle on top and just then, she's walks out of the bathroom and I start singing happy birthday. People around the room joined in and we all clapped for her as she blew out the candle.   She has this ear to ear smile that is to die for. She gave me a fairly large 'thank you' kiss and said ""I thought you forgot!"".   She took the note off of the fake pepperoni and read it. ""I will love you until the last pepperoni fades."" she starting crying like she just won the lottery.  ---- Now, fast forwarding 5 years later, we are still happily together and enjoying our youth, but her birthday is today and I plan to have dinner with her this evening.   I would love to see someone else kind enough to pass down a pizza to a young couple in love."
1934	False	a	I work as a fundraiser for a nonprofit, (thanks to some /gw posts made a while ago, I'd prefer not to say which), and our pay and our jobs are based on quotas. I'm on review, (meaning I have two days to get my average up, or I lose what is the best job I've ever had--I care so much about what I'm doing). Additionally, partly because it's been so cold here, my average has been down--which means, so is my pay. I have about $30 in the bank to last me the two weeks until next payday, but I don't even have access to it, as it's Sunday, and my atm card got stolen. I've been working all day for this non profit, (on my feet, outside), and I'm really hungry...I just ate my last two pieces of bread today. I'm applying for foodstamps tomorrow, but, obviously, that process takes a while. One pizza would give me two meals that I didn't have to wonder about. At this point, i'm just terrified of being overdrawn on my account again, bringin nothing to my boss's going away potluck tomorrow, and not being able to afford my $25 a week meds, (not having health insurance blows). The car I drive for my company is also breaking down, and a million other little things have gone wrong lately. I have never asked anything of reddit, and I feel awful for typing out this sob story. I promise that as soon as my tax refund comes through or I get a decent paycheck, (about two weeks?), I will either pay you back or pay it forward to another redditor, whichever you prefer. My roommates are also in a bind right now, but have done there best to help me out when they could, so I'd love to be able to offer them a few slices as a thanks, and to ensure that they both eat, too. Again, I'm sorry for bitching, I know I have it pretty good compared to most of the rest of the world, (a hint to the poverty-related nonprofit I work for), but I could really use some hot food and, even more so, a kind act. Whether you can help or not, thank you for reading.
1935	False	a	 I'm tired and just got family from Venezuela in today. We have nothing to eat, my grandma doesn't speak english nor is able to drive. My mom is studying for a crutial college exam and won't be back till around 9pm. I highly doubt that she'll like me doing this but I have nO money. In short, can anyone send a large cheese Pizza tO me?
1936	False	a	Recently my basement apartment was completely flooded. It took all my sheets and towels to dry the place out. So I spent the day and, what to me, is a fortune at the coin laundry. So there was no money for groceries. Today I finished off the last food, and my monthly stipend does not arrive until the day after tomorrow. I could really use a pizza.
1937	False	a	I don't even know where to begin, I am soo hungry and depressed can't even get out of bed, was supposed to start a new job over a month ago for a start up but once again date got moved.

1939	False	a	"So after 3 weeks of living off of ramen like some walking stereotype, I am in desperate need of solid food.

Please help me get a little pizza love to keep me warm tonight."

Google Kidney stone pain.  While I was in the hospital, I lost my job, (which later turns into cutting hours) because they don't think I am ""reliable and stable"", so due to this, I can't pay rent on a new place, and my lease is up August 1st, so I have to move back home.  Work decides to give me hours, but only 20hrs a week, and from my parents house, its over an hour and 15 min away.  then my 2cd week back at work, i got attacked again by kidney stones got yelled at again from my boss because I ""should have seen the stone coming and not went to work: Go to the ER, and urologist and they tell me  i have to wait 19 days to get a CT scanto see whats wrong with my kidneys Get  an email form my old landlord basically saying im not getting my deposit back.

Thanks, sorry for the really long read."
1942	True	a	I'm a single mom on unpaid medical leave. I do receive food stamps, but a random act of pizza would be really terrific. Thank you!
1943	True	a	My wife and I havent eaten anything but stale ritz crackers in four days we have managed to rummage up enough to buy our two kids one lunchable but to feed my kids tonight I might be forced to steal. We have lived in our car for a month since we were evicted from our apartment after both losing our jobs within a month of each other. please find it in your heart to help me and my family out. A young lady at the church told me about this website and I have nothing to lose... please help us.
1944	False	a	19-year old college student here, I have a grand total of 4 dollars in my bank account at the moment, and just ran out of all my food. Can somebody help me out here? I'm getting paid this week sometime and will definitely return the favor. Thanks in advance if anybody can save me here.
1945	False	a	Hey RAoP. Long-time lurker; first-time poster.  My situation requires something kind of long-term, which I don't really expect to find online (I don't want to be over-reliant on the community; you guys are great) but which I hope to... figure out fairly soon. I'm disabled; receiving assistance which is pretty inadequate -- in the process of applying for more.  Anyway, all of that aside, a pizza'd go a long way toward bridging the gap this month. I'd sincerely appreciate it.
1946	False	a	I have a stable job/income but it isn't much and most of my meals consist of 68 cent pot pies.  I would simply like to eat something different for dinner tonight.    Please ignore my request if someone else who can't actually eat posts.
1947	False	a	Two of my room mates are changing jobs and myself and my other room mate are on fortnightly pay and don't get paid till next Tuesday. Could eat a mountain of food right now. Thanks guys
1948	False	a	Rent was due last week and it cost me my whole paycheck. I'm literally broke til Saturday morning and have absolutely nothing to eat at my apartment. I would really love some pizza to get me through these next couple of days. I would really love any help and promise to pay it forward as soon as I get my financial situation back on track. I love you guys.  
1949	True	a	Long story short, my friend put his dick in crazy and decided to drop me as a friend due to her jealousy of me (another female). I'm in between jobs, not starting my new one for a while. I would love to simultaneously comfort myself over the loss of a friend and celebrate my (eventual) new job with a good pizza, but I can't. Hugs for life if someone actually does this for me! 
1950	False	a	Money's tight and we need to go grocery shopping. Down to chicken stock and ramen noodle. Was hoping to get a ROAP before work tonight, we live in the DC metropolitan area, specifically Northern VA
1951	True	a	My fiancee had surgery last week, so I took some time off of work to stay home with her for a few days.  I was going to go grocery shopping when I got off work tonight, but when I went out to my car this morning, I had a flat tire with some sort of nail/spike sticking out of the side.  I had to buy a new tire so I can get back and forth to work.  Friday, I got paid $112, giving me a total of just under $120 in my account.  The tire and labor came out to a little over $118, leaving me 82 cents in my account to last until Friday (payday).  So I wasn't able to buy groceries tonight.    In the fridge, we have half a pack of american cheese, a head of lettuce, and soy milk.  In the cabinet, we have a pack of ramen, three slices of bread, and some chocolate syrup.  We live week to week, and we have a grocery budget, and we plan out a weekly menu, buying just what we need for that week's meals.  I'm not going to pretend I've been on Reddit forever.  I created this account 8 months ago, but I never post.  I just come in once in a while to look at the funny stuff.  Tonight, I read an ABC news article about ROAP, and figured it was worth a shot.  If anyone is willing to help me out, we can survive on pizza for two days easily.    It's just my fiancee and myself.    I'm posting links to a screenshot of my bank balance, a photo of the tire receipt, and my latest paystub.  Thank you ahead of time for any help, and if no one can help, I still appreciate your taking the time to read all of this.  I know it's a lot, but the guidelines said to include details.  We have a Dominoe's down the street from us.  So, yeah.  Thanks again, either way.  http://i51.tinypic.com/126fc6a.jpg http://i51.tinypic.com/30cwzgl.jpg http://i52.tinypic.com/2hnz9yu.jpg http://i56.tinypic.com/1gtc7t.png  
1952	True	a	Hey everyone, my name is Nick, I'm 23, had to drop out of college a year ago, and I'm currently living in a van in front of my friend's house. I lost my job and have been looking for a new one for about a month and a half now, so far, to no avail. I'm not asking for a pizza just for me to enjoy, but also for my friend who is helping me out a ton until I get back on my feet. I'm not starving and I have a safe place to sleep, thanks to his generosity. It's been quite a humbling and learning experience, and I'd like to be able to give him something back in return; I feel like pizza would be a great way to do that. I can't think of anything to do or give in exchange (but if you can, let me know), other than a poem written about whatever you want and the promise to pay it forward when things get better for me. Thanks for your time! 
1953	False	a	Hey guys my brother just told me about this sub, and I couldn't have heard about it at a better time.  Long story short, I don't get to eat much due to lacking money, but I was hoping yall could help me out today :)   Anyways any consideration is greatly appreciated, and my tummy will thank you himself! :D
1954	False	a	Missed some work last week, put me behind on bills and stuff. The flu sucked but I'm better now, just broke.. I can haz pizza please?
1955	True	a	So this is my first [REQUEST] thread that I've made. It's just me and my girlfriend, both poor college students, wanting a pizza. I have posted to offers before, but never received. I will definitely be a giver when it is possible for me, but right now I'm waiting on paychecks in the mail and have no means of getting pizza for us.  If anyone would like pictures of us, we'll be glad to provide. Also, if there is anything you'd like to ask me, ask away. I'm open to just about any questions.  Thanks RAoP'ers!
1956	False	a	I'm somewhat nervous about posting, and hopefully I'll get a reply. My Mom basically got gyped on her already insufficient paycheck. Our fridge is almost totally empty, as our pantry and freezer. We've already borrowed money from my aunt so we could make tacos.. just going through a really rough time. Could someone honor us with a RAOP?
1957	True	a	Me and my girlfriend are currently in the process of moving and thus are having money problems. If someone could help us out right now that would be awesome and after the whole fiasco that is moving is over I will return the favor! 
1958	False	a	Just finished up the last of my classes and running low on funds. Looking for full time employment now that summer started to support myself.  In the mean time I am getting a bit hungry and could use a pizza,  anything would do. I made a throw away so my friends/family don't know my financial situation at the moment because I really hate asking for handouts. Im willing to provide my actual account via pm and repay the favor to you or set uo my own offer once I'm working full time.  Thank you for your timw
1959	True	a	Hello,  I am a father and husband that has been looking for employment after being laid off for some time now.  There has not been much success and my wife has been carrying all the weight.  It has definitely been a struggle to see her work so hard without being able to help.   We have literally ran out of food today and must wait for her pay day to come on Thursday.  She remains positive that we will be okay even when I feel we are about to crumble.   Looking for help to say thank you to her with a pizza for dinner.   Please help.    Thank you so much!
1960	True	a	Hey guys I'm   college student who lives in a small apartment with my friend and twin brother. We take turns cooking/buying dinner for each other and it's my turn tonight. I've been sick all weekend and would normally just order a pizza, but I instead had to spend my cash on prescriptions and my doctor's visit. If anyone could help out it'd be great. I can prove the doctor's visit and meds via PDF. I live in Tempe Arizona and it would mean the world to me if I could not break this tradition that we have in our apartment.
1961	True	a	I've never done this before, but figured as it's Christmas there may be a kind soul out there who would like to buy my needy friend and I a pizza for our dinner. Sadly each of us fall into the hopelessly unemployed graduate archetype, and this is our first Christmas away from home. We're currently huddled around my laptop for warmth as we're too afraid of turning the heating on. We would be more than happy to pay it forward when we find jobs. We are located in Berkeley. Thanks for taking the time to read this and we hope you're having a happy Christmas day!
1962	False	a	Since my family is downsizing, we have to give away our dogs of 9 and 10 years. I think some RAOP would cheer us up.
1963	False	a	hello im a single mother of 2 im currently unemplyed I dont like to ask for help but im starving I was supposr to recieve child support but havent yet so if anyone can please help I will return the favor when I scrape up some money
1964	False	a	So I'm enjoying the last days of unemployment (starting next Wednesday woo!) by setting a blanket outside with a pillow and a power strip long enough for me to take my laptop outside and a book (The Forever War). I'm not in particular need, but it's a gorgeous day, and I'm feeling like being a slug and it's my birthday tomorrow (me and my twin sister). Never done this before, not quite sure of the process. Again, not necessary at all and completely random!   I love what you guys do here and will contribute once everything starts up. That being said, as far as random acts of cookies goes, someone motivate me to try out that recipe for key lime meltaways please! Also, let me know if there's any verification needed for anything. Or if there's any special procedure I should follow. If I do this, I want to do it right!
1965	True	a	Single Mom here. So, my oldest is almost 9. She came down with strep three days after school started back. Yay. =\ Had a semi stressful weekend with trying to keep her and my youngest (almost 11 months) apart so the youngest wouldn't get infected too. However, the baby woke me up at 2am yesterday morning with a faucet for a nose and a slight cough. Called the doctor to see if that warranted a visit, and low and behold it does. She was also positive for strep. She's a really good baby though, and except for being off her bottle (I guess the sucking hurts?) a little bit, and hating to have her nose wiped, she's dealing amazingly well.   So to sum it up, I've got two sick kids and I'm behind on household chores (anyone got a laundry fairy they can spare??) and I'd really just like a night off from cooking dinner. I'm not desperate for food, and I totally understand if there are others who are and you'd rather help them.   We're in Metro Atlanta, and are happy with any of the three major chains, but we also have Hungry Howies and Bucks pizza who both have online ordering. My oldest only eats cheese, and I'll take any meat product on the other side. Allergies to mushrooms, so please none of those. :)   I hope that's enough info.. but if not, feel free to ask me anything. :)  EDIT: OMG. Thank you so much JimWill. You are the awesomest. :) 
1966	False	a	So I've been studying for a test all morning and FINALLY felt confident that I was going to get a good grade. So I get in my car to drive to class, get onto the highway, start going about 60MPH...and my front tire pops.   I honestly do not know how I didn't get in an accident. It was really terrifying. So, now all of my money will be going towards buying new tires. I also missed my test :(   I hate having a sob story but I would seriously love some pizza to celebrate not being injured/dead. Thanks for reading! 
1967	False	a	Trying to save up money to go to make-up school and its been 6months since I have eaten a pizza. If I keep to my strict saving I will be able to enter my school by January!! Would love to taste the lovely stuff again. If anyone would like to help a Londoner out I would be very grateful. If I make it in the make-up world I will give you a free make over :)   
1968	False	a	Currently home on leave for a few days with my kid, I'm currently in a money situation until the 1st. Trying to see if I could get a little help till then to put a smile on my daughters face. It will be greatly appreciated.
1969	False	a	I've been a fool with my money basically. I'm a student in London in my first year. I'm getting a ride home on Wednesday but until then i'm out of pocket and VERY hungry. A slice would be very appreciated.
1970	False	a	It's the last day of the holidays and I head back to Uni, UoB, this Monday. Will be travelling all day tomorrow to get back up North so this will be my last meal before heading up. Any kind souls who feel up for helping me have a hot meal before driving all day would be loved eternally till the resurrection of FSM.  Thanks &lt;3
1971	False	a	... do you guys deliver to Afghanistan because the little pizzas at the chow hall suck.
1972	True	a	Yesterday I got laid off with a job I've been working for over a year now. My boyfriend hasn't been working for the past two months since he also got laid off working construction. I have no idea what we are going to do now..rent is due on the 5th at the latest and the next check I get wont be until the 12th. Pretty much feeling shitty about everything right now, trying to figure out what I can do to get money quickly. Plus my ph. is gonna be outta mins, my insurance, and internet bill is due...oh ya &gt;.&lt; ...could really use a random act of pizza. 
1973	False	a	My girlfriend has been working a lot lately and has been feeling sick, and her favorite food is pizza, so she would be really happy to enjoy a pizza.  Edit* she gets off at 6.  Edit two* she isn't coming over on account of feeling worse, is there someone who can order it for her house?
1974	True	a	'Sright. In exchange for sending me pizza, I will do my damnedest to draw your likeness on my own body. With a sharpie.  No, I'm not out of cash, I'm not grieving a loss, and I'm certainly not craving vegetables (you thought those jokes were over, didn't you?). Just looking to be part of something entertaining.  Notes: I'm NOT an art student. I'm not even very good at drawing. But I'm still going to do everything in my power to draw my very best for you. Also: you could request your favorite animal if you don't like the idea of your face drawn on some stranger somewhere.  Please also note where you'd like me to draw. Before you do, however, contort yourself and see if you could accurately draw on that part of yourself. If you can't: I can't.  Let's have some Sunday fun, shall we?
1975	False	a	Long story short, its a school holiday and all I have is ramen and water. Anything would be greatly appreciated. 
1976	False	a	Probably a long shot. Broke, no real money til next week. Can provide pictures of kitten attempting to eat pizza.  Just gonna be lounging around watching football this weekend with my kitties, eating oatmeal, lol.  I'm in Georgia, but not a Georgia fan.
1977	False	a	Hi Reddit,  Before you all jump on me for being a new member, I hope you will take the chance to read my plea.  Yes, I'm new to the community, no I didn't hear about it through the news reports the other day, but rather heard about it from a family friend.    In the past month, my life has essentially fallen apart.  My wife of 15 years has all but thrown in the towel to our marriage.  She has moved back in with her parents, and I'm living in our house with our two children, Jennifer &amp; William.  Along with this added stress, I've just lost my job as a management consultant.  So now I'm left with a broken heart, a hole in my pocket and two hungry kids to feed.  We're not in as terrible of a position as other members on here, but I was wondering if a kind member would be willing to donate a pizza so I can surprise my kids at some point, and hopefully help them get their minds off our current situation.   Thank you all so much for even reading this.
1978	False	a	Plus, I've never met any local redditors.
1979	False	a	At least I don't think I will be spending my 21st birthday alone... will I??!  thanks :)  EDIT: located in the Bay Area of California :)
1980	False	a	Psalms 12:4 ''Lest ye be without pizza, ask upon the goodwill of Reddit and ye shall be rewarded...with pizza''  EDIT: PLEASE JEEBUS.
1981	True	a	"So I had a phenomenal day on Friday, I have to tell you all about it.   I went into work and was called into the office of the Manager who runs the whole establishment, mind you I've never even spoken to the man. He begins grilling me about some sensitive information I had leaked and wants to know how I found out. I have two choices, give him a name, or be fired.  What was the information? Well I asked the sous chef's mother how her daughter was doing after not getting the job. Apparently no one knew she hadn't gotten it yet somehow I did.  How did I find this information out? A random conversation with a co-worker about who the new chef is going to be.  Nothing fishy in the whole thing. I was going through my day-to-day work life without a care in the world and bam, I'm in my boss's, boss's, boss's office under the microscope being pushed for a name and I couldn't for the life of me remember who told me what seemed to be such trivial information. So just like that I got the hammer.  I somehow took the news alright. I mean, I was definitely plotting my revenge on ""the man"" and making plans to build my own corporation that would ravage their puny establishment until it begged to be put out of it's misery, but my head was up and my spirits were high.  I drove out of the parking lot and hit the job hunt immediately. Which lasted all of about 30 minutes when it ended abruptly and I found myself underneath a 2006 Dodge Charger.   The driver, not wanting to waste the precious moments of their ever important life, decided to skip the traffic at a stop light by driving up the shoulder and wound up directly on top of me, totaling my bike.  So now we're at the present moment. I'm on my 5th day of leg elevated bed lock down, the bills are still coming in, and the hunger is rumbling. I heard about this subreddit and thought I'd give it a shot. Even if I there's no pizza to be had it was nice to tell the story. I hope you enjoyed it and thanks in advance for filling a crippled mans tummy! hahaha"
1982	False	a	I've been eating noodles and peanut butter crackers only for six days.  I don't get paid until Friday. I'm losing my mind. I need something different. Help me break the streak of crackers and noodles.
1983	False	a	Me and my boy (5 years of age) wouldn't mind eating something other than noodles today.  [Take a look at our fridge..](http://imgur.com/LGM7N)  Luckily before my unemployment ran out I got the bright idea to stock up on [noodles](http://imgur.com/5N5rA), and [such](http://imgur.com/Fn1ee).(There are 28 square packs left and 36 cups for those who are curious..)  I am in no way implying that we are without food to eat (coz' noodles count as food right?), just wondering if anyone out there wouldn't mind tossing a pie our way.   **Edit**: I am no longer in need of pizza for tonight, fate has smiled upon me and my son, providing us with pizza from another source. Thank you anyway reddit :) (Current Time: 10:43pm)
1984	False	a	EDIT: Will do crazy shit or whatever a soul kind enough to bestow upon me a pizza wishes.
1985	False	a	It's Tuesday and the week isn't looking up. Trying to get a job but it's not working out, still have to eat. I'd love it if I could get a pie today. 
1986	False	a	"Due to shitty circumstances and misinformation I missed dinner at the dining hall tonight.  The express option was not available due to ""spring cleaning"".  Me and twelve other unhappy campers got shafted.....  Also, it was wing night at the express dinner.....  Double wut-ze-fuck....  Anywho, I realized that I also have like $3.83 in my bank account until tomo, so if someone would like help me out that would be amazing!! :)))))"
1987	True	a	Hey gents and ladies,  I am a very poor college student that has to work to pay for school, rent, and food because the rents refuse to help. Because I came down with the flu for a week and a half, I couldn't go in to work (its policy) and thus only have money for rent. I've been subsisting just about entirely on PB&amp;J sammiches. I just finished biking home from work, and would really appreciate a nice warm pizza tonight.   Ps-I am using a throwaway because my main is linked to several close friends that are also redditors, and I don't want them to know of my financial situation.  You guys are fantastic, and if anyone does respond, please know that you will make a poor UF girl really happy! &lt;3 :D  **Edit: it appears my title lost my location. I'm in Florida. :)
1988	True	a	There seem to be a lot of people on here more deserving than I am but I will give it a shot.  I'm a 24 year old public servant (Police/Fire Dispatcher) and my last check came up way short because of some unforeseen BS.  I've made it almost 2 weeks with 5 bucks but with 4 days left its run out and I've run out of ideas.  Any help would be appreciated. 
1989	False	a	I am really depressed, job seeking not going so well. I am sick of eating sandwiches and rice (but happy to be eating something). I know this is a bit of a long shot but I would love a pizza
1990	False	a	My friend, also a redditor, and I have been homeless for the last few weeks together. We have been having to shoplift what food we can and we've begged change. We have a steady location for the next 24 hours or so.  Anyone out there that can help us out? It would be greatly appreciated. We've been surviving on next to nothing for the past week.  Thanks. 
1991	False	a	I know i am a new user and am willing to show any proof needed to show im not a troll or scammer. would really help this little family out since we are down to just a couple of boxes of mac and cheese and my wife dosnt get paid untill the 7th. e-mail is camarocutt@hotmail.com
1992	True	a	Hey there pizzaland! Pizza would be pretty awesome right now. Definitely don't need it, not starving or anything, but a nice pie is always tasty and would be a welcome treat from all the sandwiches I've been surviving on. I'm currently saving up all my money until after next pay day so I can go see my BFF graduate bootcamp in San Diego. I've been scrimping and saving to make this happen, so unfortunately pizza is just not in the budget right now.    If anyone would make my night and send me a pizza pie - that would put me over the moon. I'll definitely return the deed in a few weeks once I have some extra spending money (august 9th).  May the pizza deities guide and protect you.
1993	False	a	Recently laid off and up on Capitol Hill, have my dog keeping me company for these very depressing last few days. Made a big pot of spaghetti four days ago that I have been reheating to eat for breakfast lunch and dinner while I wait for unemployment to kick in and pizza would be a nice change, I will return the favor once I am on my feet again in a few weeks, there is a Pizza Hut nearby. Anything helps :)
1994	False	a	So my new boss (I work at a math tooterin' center) messed up adding me to the payroll and I don't get paid til next Friday.  I spent the last of my money yesterday by ordering an eggroll for pickup with the last ~$2 in my bank account then buying veggie fried rice with my last $4 in change when I went to get it (real sneaky sorta cept I shoulda just bought ramen/cheap groceries).  I'm seeing my family this weekend so they'll definitely feed me, but til then it's not looking good.     I'm not gonna link to the music cause I don't want this to come off like a sneaky promo, but if you want to hear it and you message me I won't turn you down
1995	False	a	I'll survive the night, but it won't be pretty. I think I can see my heart beating through my ribcage. Is that normal?   I have a Dominos, Little Cesars, and Hungry Howie's in town. 
1996	False	a	Not trying to give a sob story. Times are rough right now and my mom had some medical issues that I left college to come home to help with. A pizza would brighten both of our days. I'll pay it forward as soon as I can afford to do so.
1997	True	a	"Trying to set up a surprise romantic evening for my hubby and I.  Only detail is that we are vegan, however there is a nice place close by that offers a large, 1 topping, for $10, that is made with vegan cheese and they have vegan toppings. I have all the other ""components"" for the evening ready to go, just need the pizza. Thanks in advance.  PS. I promise to post pics!"
1998	False	a	I have never been so scared in my life. My daughter and I were walking home from the park, when a man approached us. He asked me if I could spare some change. We were near the vending machines, so I assumed that was what he needed the change for. After handing him the change, he reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a gun. He took my purse, my watch, my wedding band, and my daughters ipod. I am shaking as I type this because I can't believe that something like this could happen in this community. I am the type of person that would give the shirt off my back to someone if they needed it. Now, I'm without cash, my cards have been cancelled and I literally have nothing.   The police said someone else was robbed a few days ago and think it may be the same person. I filed a police report and I hope the find the SOB. Pardon me, but it's the truth. If the man was in desperate need for help, I would have been willing to help him. He not only took from me, but he also took from my child and I was powerless to stop it from happening.   I hope someone can buy a pizza for my daughter and I tonight. I realize it's late, but we just don't have enough food in the house to wait until Monday when my banking situation will be resolved. I can provide a copy of the police report and any other verification information you may need. Please, I am begging for help. We are in St. Louis.
1999	False	a	Not much to say, super hungry and bored and i don't get paid until next week. If anyone wants to help a bro out it'd be legit.
2000	True	a	My foodstamps come in on the 8th and I have 13 dollars of it left. It would be nice to have some piece of mind for a night. I don't really want to broadcast my life and what is going on but if you would like to know for some legitimacy I can tell you. I just need some cheering up and have someone nice to come along to keep my faith up.  -Edit- I'm in Lakewood/Denver CO area
2001	False	a	Short version. We are a family of 5. 2 adults. 3 kids. Ages 11-9-3 My husband lost his job and we are worn out and stressed. We have food, we are not poor. We would just like some Pizza to help cheer up the family and give mommy and daddy a break from cooking ! Mainly our toddler who LOVES PIZZA. ! we promise to pay it forward when we get the cash! We have a papa johns close by, that has to be carryout, the refuse to deliver to APT COMPLEX. Promise to upload a pic or 2 enjoying the pizza.  if we could we'd appreciate two lg peps, but whatever we can get. We'll be grateful  THANKS FROM Midwest City, Ok
2002	True	a	My foot is swollen and I really should stay in bed, unfortunately I'm getting hungry and shouldn't really stand around the kitchen and cook. Being a college student, I'm also tight on money - so a random pizza would be awesome. :)  I'm not sure what I can give in return, but when I do get around to getting paid, I'd be more than happy to continue on the random acts of pizza.
2003	False	a	Sitting here with myself, my two sisters, and my elder sister's boyfriend. We've been cooking our own meals the past few nights, but today I'm thinking pizza. Parents are coming home soon and we gotta start cleaning up.
2004	False	a	Being a girl isn't fun sometimes. I need pizza.
2005	False	a	Alright, this isn't me, but my friend. He's a pre-law student trying to get into rapping. He's written about a dozen songs now about political issues/social issues/weed etc. and is about to go into a recording studio tomorrow to get his first demo recorded. He's completely baked right now and is aching for a pizza. Any redditor wanna wish him good luck tomorrow with a pizza and a drink?
2006	False	a	Hey guys! This is my first post on here and I wanted to tell you that people like you restore my faith in humanity. I am a broke college student who is working his way through college. My family supports me, but can not give me money at this time.  I work a full time job at a minimum wage place just to get my tuition and rent. Things are a little tight for money since the new school year is coming up. So i came to you guys who might have a little extra money to throw at us poor people. I could really use a hot pizza from where ever and it would be much appreciated! Thanks! 
2007	True	a	Nobodys fault but mine, i didnt get my card out of the atm quick enough. ( i dropped my bag and all my stuff fell out ) It was eaten ( by the machine ) and blocked..   we only just got paid and we have no food. I need to wait a few days for the new card to arrive. This is soooo stupid but i feel really bad. Im not the only one who will be hungry becuase of this. Please please.     I know this is a new acc but i am a active redditor of a few years , can pm you if you like. A friend is also a reddior ,has started checking on me and dont want to worry them as i know she cant help.   
2008	False	a	i'm not really sure how to go about this, any advice welcome 
2009	False	a	We dont tend to have fast food pizza, we make all our own food at home, but we do enjoy a good hot pizza every now and then. We are incredibly unlikely to buy OURSELVES a pizza, as we tend to use our food money at the Farmer's Market, but if someone were to buy us a pizza today, I would definitely return the favor, or pay it forward, whichever the sender prefers. We are located in North Florida and we are not at all picky as to which chain the pizza comes from :)
2010	False	a	Hi I know I am new here but I had to try and at least ask. I've been on reddit for only a couple days and I first asked on [/r/loans](/r/loans) for a small loan for gas money so I can start my new job but I am too new so there has been no offers. Well I think I lost my chance at this new job. I will find out tomarrow.  (I'm telling you all this so you know why I posted there for a loan and now here for pizza. We currently have $0.36 to our name. My husband asked for overtime at his job so he has to work 12 hrs tonight. I have no food to make him for lunch and he has to eat with working so many hours. If anyone can help I will pay back with interest plus I will buy another fellow member a pizza on 12/22(Thursday). I don't care about eating myself I just really would like to get my hubby something as starving and working a physically damanding job is torture. (he does metal finishing like chrome plating). So please if you can help me feed my hubby you would be my personal pizza angel:) I will be forever indebt to you!! If you can't I still would like to thank you for at least reading my post:)
2011	False	a	Bozeman, MT
2012	False	a	My whole life is going wrong and there is nothing I can do to make it better. There is way too many bad things going on right now ad I can't stop it. Would someone be so kind as to raise my hopes up a little and gift me a pizza? I will gladly repay the favor when I get some money next week. Thank you for reading this and god bless you. I live in Katy, Texas
2013	True	a	Here it is, the first of the month.  My bills are paid off, I'm in minimal debt, and once again both my mother and my ex-girlfriend haven't paid me back.  I have some rice and a can of green beans, and hot sauce.  If I could collect interest or force them to pay, I would, but I'm just not the kind of guy to stress the important ladies in my life just so I can enjoy a small luxury of life; so I'm asking YOUUU!  I don't have much to give in return, but I'm a fairly decent wordsmith and I do still have some l3375k1ll5 online, so I can even play something with you if you're that bored, or write you something.  My senior humanities project was a Star Trek fan script, fyi.  Thanks in advance to all whom at least read this lone whimper in a sea of screams.  EDIT: PIZZA DELIVERED IN LESS THAN AN HOUR.  HOLY BALLS THAT'S FAST THANKS FOR ONE LAST TIME, PWNDCAKE.    he deserves his badge of kindness!  EDIT 2: LAVA CAKES MOFOS~!   LAAAVAAAA CAAAAKES.
2014	True	a	Hey there RAOP, I'm currently at home with my brother and we are really hungry. My mom has little to no money and won't be able to go food shopping for another 2 days. I was wondering if any of you would be kind enough to supply us with a pizza for tonight :] I've only lurked in here, so I don't really know if it's a crazy thing to request pizza hut. Thanks &lt;3  Edit: Thanks to Yarrg for hooking us up! Greatly appreciated!
2015	False	a	I'm a poor guy. My family and I usually have enough food to go around for the week but this week it's been pretty bad. I know it seems kind of pitiful and rude to ask, but I'd just like a pizza for my family and I. Thank you very much for looking through this.
2016	False	a	To be honest I don't really have much of a sob story. I'm just broke and really hungry.. Lol. Anyone wanna help out a fella?
2017	False	a	I've had the occasional gout attack but the ones this week have taken the cake. Have been bedridden and crawling around literally and had an attack in my other foot last night so unable to get around at all. If anyone suffers from guilt you know how hellish and depressing it is. Anyways just posting to see if any kind sympathetic soul would send a pizza over (easy on the meat ; )) since I can even get up and cook. I guess I could crawl to the door. Thanks.
2018	False	a	My wife doesn't know I'm doing this, but she will be home from work in an hour or so and I thought it would be nice to surprise her with pizza! A series of unfortunate circumstances (notice of losing my job, lost keys to our apartment that necessitated the services of a locksmith, and a fussy cat) happened this past week that unfortunately led to us draining our bank account.  I feel bad posting this as I'm sure there are countless others who probably need it more than we do, but I figured I would ask anyway. I hope to be on the giving end next week!
2019	False	a	In Fargo, ND if it matters
2020	False	a	RAOP-- you guys are wonderful.  Request fulfilled. Will thank/post update before tomorrow's end. ^^
2021	False	a	So after my bf shattered his ankle this morning we had to go to the ER and pay for the visit the xrays the crutches and the pain meds. After all that we are now dead broke and I don't get paid until Friday, would love some nice yummy pizza for the night!
2022	True	a	It's been a rough couple of weeks. Found out last week that the guy I've been seeing has a girlfriend. Then found out today that it's going to cost almost 200$ for a medical procedure I need for my stomach. I really could use a little bit of cheesy cheer.  As soon as I can pay it forward I will!
2023	False	a	I work 6 sometimes 7 days a week as a waitress to pay my bills, and live on my own. Was going to go shopping for food today (Which is why I even had all my money/tips on me to begin with....) when some older scruffy guy shoved me to the ground, and stole my purse :( I can get some tips working the day after 2morrow (imagine that, tomorrow is my first day off in 10days *sigh*), and buy food, but I'm really kinda hungry tonight.
2024	False	a	Hey, everyone.   Between my roommate and myself, we have less than twenty cents. Neither of us are looking forward to going more days without eating.   A random act of pizza would be wonderful right about now. We would both be grateful and delighted. 
2025	True	a	On Sept 30th our baby boy Ezra was born and unexpectedly had a long NICU stay in a hospital over an hour away from our home... and that really drained our account.  We have two other kids, and my husband being out of work for so long while I stayed to breastfeed the new baby in the NICU unit made money even tighter, and on top of everything else, we got a SPEEDING TICKET heading to the hospital initially to have him, no joke!  He sure is cute though and worth ALL we went through a million times over: http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/9149/ezra016.jpg  Today my husband texted me twice from work that he is depressed.  He totally forgot he missed his certification test (that we had to pay for!) this morning because he was doing his defensive driving course online for 6 hours and had too much on his mind.  Then his watch broke at work :(  He won't be home for another hour and I feel so bad for him, he is really feeling down on himself since we are so short on money and everything has gone so wrong.  A pizza would really cheer him (and our 2 toddlers!) up.  Even our German Shepherd would appreciate the scrap pizza crust - poor girl has been here by herself a lot lately. I would appreciate it SO much, and we would gladly post a picture upon receipt to show our appreciation.  We live in Texas, and Pizza Hut sounds HEAVINGLY.
2026	False	a	I'm in summer school and I spent all my money on books and Webassign. ($200 just to access my homework...)  I have a minimum wage job that pays on a week delay and I won't see a nickel until June 11. [Here is all the food I have left.](http://imgur.com/7qK3D7o)  I would be sooooooo happy to have some pizza this evening.  Raleigh, NC  Edit: Do one of you know me? I just got an email for a free pizza from Papa Johns...
2027	False	a	"Food stamps are now 2 weeks late due to moving counties and a new case worker that is slow as molasses in January. She's had my completed file for 2 full weeks (as of Friday) and still hasn't ""processed"" it. (Whatever that entails..)   My family (Me, Hubby, and 2yr old baby girl) have been living off our pantry and freezer for 2+ weeks. Last night we used our last chicken breast. Today was literally buttered rice.  The food stamp office is closed till Monday morning at which point I will be calling my case worker, her supervisor, as well as her supervisor's supervisor; hourly, if necessary, until I have money to buy food for my family.  Until then anyone wanna send us a pizza?  edit: p.s. no papa johns in my city... thank you Sniperman for the offer though! Hope someone else gets to enjoy that pizza! "
2028	False	a	Today my friends are helping my mom and I to a new house. I would love to get them some pizza for their hard work later today.
2029	False	a	i am a single mother of 2 who recently lost my job. we are on such a tight budget &amp; unable to afford to eat anything other than hot dogs ramen n mac n cheese. waiting on assitance &amp; employers seems to take forever when u r so desperate &amp; have to provide for 2. my sons would love some pizza since this is unaffordable for us. thank you so much for your kindness. happy 4th! 
2030	True	a	my moms monthly check doesnt come till tomorrow and theres no food to make at my house other than rice or toast, ive been makin watever i could find these last few days. i hav a nice family and were usually doin good on our own, but the bills this month were more than expected so we had to buy less food.
2031	True	a	Hello. This is my first time on this subreddit, because I usually have enough money to order, but this time, I don't. So thanks to anybody who is a fellow pizza-lover, and pizza on!
2032	True	a	Been fending off this bug for about a week and it has finally caught up to me. So I am at home, feeling crummy and losing money. Don't have the energy to cook and would be eternally grateful for a pie. 
2033	True	a	I spend my days making magic for little kids at DisneyQuest. Between car payments and housing, I'm at about 48cents in my back account right now. I'm hungry and just got home from a nice 10-hour shift and I was hoping someone out there would be willing to feed me. I'll return the favor or pay it forward anyway I possibly can. Any redditor in the Orlando area wanna get into Disney for free? I'll hook you up. :]  [My Disney name tag](http://hphotos-sjc1.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/264710_1626693143620_1125270824_31873134_8125879_n.jpg)  [I get to wear a cool costume too](http://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/227890_1573589896072_1125270824_31806294_2054237_n.jpg)
2034	True	a	So, I'm apartment sitting for a friend of mine, in College Park MD, and since it's summer, the college-apartments are pretty much empty. And I'm broke, with no car, so I can't buy food and even if I could I'd have no way to get there. r/raop, can you help?
2035	False	a	We are a family of 3 wanting a dinner of pizza. We have barely any food left this month food-stamps dont come in till the 6th. My 3 year old loves plain pizza and bread sticks. We are a very low income family trying to make it until my boyfriend finds a job. 
2036	True	a	I'm a 21 year old Boston college student and my bank account is overdrawn until Monday. I've been living on ramen noodles and some old brownies I made last week. A pizza would really help get me through the weekend!   I can pay it forward (or back! if you prefer) on Monday when I get my check!  Thanks in advance to whoever can help! 
2037	False	a	"November is notorious for ""no-shave"" or ""no-whatever"" 30 day fasting, but this is crossing the line! We have bonded over so many things via pizza, it is one of the major cornerstones of our friendship. I have already fought several long battles with her over this- how dare she leave me in the trenches alone! She will be home from work in about an hour and a half to two hours. This is my final stand against no-pizza-november, she won't listen to my reasoning any longer - Reddit help me out and be the calvary!  EDIT: SUCCESSSSSSSSS!! Thanks to TheSheepdog she finally caved in!! ""Last one for the month.."" Psh yeah right. She knows she loves this bonding session way too much, haha. [Here are some pics!](http://imgur.com/a/t9Yr7#0) Don't let her fake sad face fool you, she loved every bite :)"
2038	False	a	I'll be sure to pay it forward! This month is just really hard because my roommates moved out right before rent is due and I had to buy a bunch of things to get by (they--a couple--took everything we originally split the cost of, so I have no dishes or utensils, cookware, etc.) until I find a place w/ my soon-to-be new roommates. And I don't make nearly enough at my minimum-wage job to afford rent by myself (college student!) so I already had to borrow $500 to cover part of my rent from my parents. They're really broke too.  Luckily I just got a second job and have been working my butt of at my current one, so once I'm well budgeted again, I'll be more than happy to pay the deed forward! 
2039	False	a	Been sick, nothing too bad just flu like cold. Only have been eating soup, thus haven't stocked up on food for a while. I will pay it forward for the holidays!
2040	False	a	Husband, wife and two small kids pizza eating family haven't had one in 4 months no extra cash. Would love one for supper tomorrow any one want to help. Pizza hut is closet to me in IL. 
2041	False	a	So lately Reddit, i've been lurking a lot. I've given pizza to Constructor who is a close personal friend whom I talk to often. I've always been a giver... Never one to ask for much of anything.  Lately its just been a series of downfalls for me. First to start, my girlfriend left me around october. Right after I got a new job, that was fun. Getting put into the mental ward at the hospital cuz I got so damn depressed that I was gonna kill myself.  The second to come was the reapearance of the scabies i've been trying to get rid of that my ex girlfriend had given to me. She caught them SOMEWHERE and i'm STILL not sure how she got them. The Medicine costs a fortune and i was lucky to get the first tube for pretty much free, but then I lost my insurance.  I've been trying and trying, day after day to make myself feel better - gifting people things like games on steam, pizza to close friends and helping other people like my coworker Ryan whom has a kid and a wife and always eats raman for his break because he's dirt broke all the time.  I don't know what it is, and I sit here, hungry myself, cold cuz I don't have heating in my house because I heat it with propane and I don't even have enough money for that.  On top of it all, today i'm sitting here in pain because on my way to work (which i'm missing today due to this) I got hit by a car. I ride a bike so... You can kinda imagine what thats like. My back rim is mangled, luckily the person who hit me bought me a new rim and got me a ride home, but fuck. I'm just like... STOP THIS NONSENSE!  So all i'm asking for is some pizza guys. Anyone, it don't matter, small pie, it's whatever.  I live in the New Jersey area in Mantua. Pats pizza is my favorite, but i'll go for pizza hut cuz I like most of their stuff too.   Thanks in advance for just reading. :)
2042	False	a	Hiya, I apologize for not really being a part of the reddit community, but I browse from time to time. Please don't hold it against me. Anyways, here's the deal. It's Saturday, I have a little over $5 in my bank account, nothing but roommate chow at the apartment, a flat tire on my bike, and it's so windy and dusty out that the sky is pretty brown right now.   By trade, I am a freelance writer. Sometimes it pays fabulously, the last few months not so much. But I understand the give-and-take of economy and I'd much rather put something together for you than accept charity. So I'm thinking a page of whatever you want for a medium pizza. Haiku about Thundercats, a love poem for your girlfriend to smooth over the fact that you got really drunk last night, I can get you started on that paper you're putting off, or just the word butt as many times as I can fit on the page. And none of that copy-paste bull crap either, I promise to type each one of those butts individually and by hand.  Maybe you want more than one page. These things happen. And I happen to be able to put away far more pizza than is probably healthy for me. Or I might want mushrooms AND pepperoni. We can work it out.  Just about the only thing I won't write is a signed confession that I was the one who committed that murder the cops are getting closer to solving. Let them figure it out on their own.  If you order a pizza for me, I promise to not only write for you, but will also enjoy said pizza ravenously while playing the video game of your choice, assuming I have it in my collection (odds estimated at 1 in 15). Can provide photo proof of brown sky, flat tire on bike, or other reasonable requests if needed. Will gladly provide gratuitous photo proof of pizza enjoyment if desired.  Thanks RAoP!
2043	False	a	Financial situation is kinda bad, but I wish I could celebrate.
2044	False	a	I live in bristol stoke gifford and really need a pizza. I need a pizza because i really need to make my sister happy again shes kind of depressed and i know how much she loves pizza so this would be perfect treat for her. Her favourite type is meat pizza but others will do fine.  Thanks :)
2045	False	a	Long story short: I am a British student who is now living in Canada and have been the past 11 months. I  recently lost my job at a youth hostel in downtown Toronto (also where I live) and for the past 2 weeks I have struggled desperately to get a replacement job but to no avail. With rent coming, phone bill to pay, and other assortments, I'm stressing. Hard.  I've never had to ask people for handouts, and I really don't know how to go about asking, so I'll just say it.  I would like a pizza Reddit. I have absolutely no cash left and I have barely and food left in my fridge; the past 3 days I have survived on water from the tap, peanuts and microwavable popcorn.  It's a joke, really, and I am ashamed. I have been a long-time lurker and never actually thought I'd create an account solely for this purpose.  Apologies, but help is appreciated.  Proof if required.
2046	False	a	That's it.  Been sick all week... called out during the week but had to work today - 12 hours.  Husband has been laid off.  House guest is staying with us for a couple days before he goes to an ashram for several months.  I'm tired and really don't want to have to cook dinner tonight after my commute home... but also don't have the cash available for take out.  Will spread your kindness! In Berkeley, CA.
2047	True	a	This is my first and only time doing this, but I have a good friend a couple of states away in TN whos life isn't going to well right now. She is responsible for saving me from myself a few years ago and is a great person. Her life isn't going so well right now and she needs a good cheering up. I really don't want to come off as begging, but I don't have the money to do this right now. Dominos is the only place in the area that delivers to her house. She LOVES pizza. If anyone can help with this, well that'd be really great. 
2048	False	a	I am embarrassed to ask...but I started a new job a week ago (no paycheck for two weeks) and my kids have been eating rice for three days.  They have been far more understanding than they had to be.  I would really love to give them something special tonight (but I cannot).  If any one could help save them from yet another night of white rice, I would be most grateful.   And would love to pay it forward when I get paid next week! 
2049	False	a	My sister is home from college break, and we're going to watch a movie together since we don't get to see each other very much. I'd be willing to trade an amateurish face removal in Photoshop for it (the higher res the picture, the better it'll be done).  I'll also send you examples of my face removals if you'd like. Imgur won't let me upload them from my phone. 
2050	False	a	This is one of times where cash is short and I'm trying to make my Friday night home a good one tonight. Mostly producing electronic music and occasionally playing dota2. Some pizza would hit the spot and make this a superb night. Just some cheap Dominos or whatever. Let me know if you want to help out! Thank you very much.
2051	False	a	Anyone wanna make me look like the best boyfriend ever? She's vegetarian =/
2052	False	a	I was working in the kitchen when I elbowed a steak knife that was on the edge of the counter (I didn't notice it, foolishly) and it fell onto my foot... Proof is in the a post to r/health on my page (this is a throwaway account).  I'd be grateful to anyone who could help me out with getting a pizza. I can't go to an ER until tomorrow (the only time I can get a ride to do so).   If further proof is needed I'll take another picture of my foot with a date and time card next to it. Thanks in advance to anyone with offers.  I understand that this is an odd post and I'm embarrassed about it, honestly, but I can't work in the kitchen to make top ramen tonight, hell, I haven't even cleaned up the mess on the floor yet. :/  Edit:Got to an ER. Still haven't eaten and can't walk. Would still love a pizza if anyone's willing.
2053	False	a	Hi RAOP! I heard of this website through wishuponahero.com and was hoping I could get a lil help tonight for myself and my boys. I have been working PT and taking care of my fiancee and four boys n house FT. I finally got sick and went ot the drs today. I have an upper respitory infection and post nasal drip. Im hoping for a pizza hero for tonight. I work at the dominos in town and know that they are having two or more 2 topping pizzas for 5.99 each. I would need at least 3 since my boys eat like garbage disposals lol. any help would be awesome. thank you. oh and i did that get verified thing and have a code from it.
2054	True	a	Hello everyone. Recently I have been struggling to get by, I had about ¬£20 to my name. I decided to sell a ton of my stuff on Amazon to raise money for Christmas presents. So I managed to sell ¬£350 worth of stuff (pretty much everything I had of value), but now Amazon says I have to wait til the 29th to cash out. So, I have no stuff, no money to buy Christmas presents, and I've used the ¬£20 I had to my name for postage. My friend told me about this site and how there are some wonderful people out there who will buy pizza for needy people. I have never really thought of myself as needy, but at this time, I am ashamed to say I am. I hardly slept last night as I was so hungry, I have been relying on a packet of lollipops that I bought for 4p, which I actually picked up as I was walking through the town centre - oh the shame! :( I have a very small family, and they all live 2 1/2 hours away on the train, so it looks like I'm stuck til I get paid on the 6th January. If I have any spare money after I get paid, I'll certainly buy another person a pizza.  I am from the UK, but I'm sure if you're not from the UK it would be possible to get a pizza to me. I know this may seem like a lie because I have just registered, but really, I have never been on this site before, and I can provide proof of my bank balance, my packet of lollipops, etc if needed. Hopefully it won't come to that.  I'd like to give my sincere thanks in advance to anyone who comes forward and fulfills my request. 
2055	False	a	I'd really appreciate it :).. I have $3 for 2 weeks.  There is a Pizza Hut very close by me, but I'm not picky :)
2056	False	a	Bad night last night led to a break up with my, now ex, girlfriend.  Been with her for 3.5 years.  Feeling really down and would love somebody to make me feel better.  First time posting here.  Let's see what happens.  In Richmond, VA.
2057	False	a	This week has got to be the hardest week of October so far...and it's about a week before my birthday as well.  So far, it's started off extremely stressful: annotated bibliography due tomorrow (10/13/2011) for art history along with 500-600 words of a proposal + thesis + works of art; horrible critique in advanced drawing 2...the redo for two of our projects is due this Friday (10/14/2011); I have a psychology test on drugs that Friday as well...; I gotta put out three logos by Thursday of next week which I haven't done yet because of the above items.  I could go on about how crappy this week has started and can only say that I wish time would go faster to get to my birthday (October 21!!!).  Would someone be kind enough to send pizza for these long nights to come?
2058	False	a	Honestly, it's almost comical at this point looking at this past week. The amazingness started off with school. I had been working on this massive art project, however I was far behind because no matter what I would do, my teacher would come back saying that personally didn't like it. Not that it wasn't good, she just didn't like it. This put me back roughly 3 days behind everyone else in the class. Come Monday projects are getting turned in, and I don't have mine done because of how far behind I was because of her. She said too bad and told me to better manage my time. Even the other students in the class told her she wasn't being fair and it wasn't my fault. I just say okay, and work to get it in as soon as I can. Tuesday comes. I go into work after class, and go to look at my schedule for the next week. I'm scheduled for 12 hours. I go to ask one of my managers what's up because I literally can't even pay for my gas to drive to work on those hours. Apparently someone decided to start a rumor about me at work that I was tired of working there and that I was bad-mouthing the managers. Instead of coming to talk to me, they listened to the rumors and cut my hours. Wednesday comes around. I'm on my to school when my car starts acting funny. I'm on my way to class, and am almost at the school, so I just try and get the school where I can look at my car. I'm in the parking lot getting ready to pull into a spot when my car dies. Steam starts coming out from under the hood, I knew it had overheated. My temp gauge didn't show it was overheating so it told me that my thermometer was broken. I call my dad and tell him I'm stuck at the school, he says when he gets a chance he'll bring a thermometer up to me and we'd replace it at the school. I wait 20 minutes, start the car up again,  pull into the closest spot, and go to class. I come out from class and look under the hood. Radiator is empty and the resevoir tank is massively overfilled, leading to the thermometer again. I put water in my radiator, and try to start my car; nothing. I try again, hear a loud bang, get a big puff of smoke, and my car dies. I just cracked the engine block, meaning my car is dead. As a side note, my school and work is 40 minutes away one from where I live. I cannot live without having a car. So now I'm having to borrow my dad's car. Next comes Thursday. My parents are going through a very bad divorce, and my dad was having to travel to a different state for the trial. I get a call from him late in the afternoon, in which he's very upset with me. The day before I told my mom about my car, and told her I was using my dad's car, and then she asked how my dad was going to the trial. This was where I made my mistake: I told her that he was using his company credit card. Apparently she used this information in court against him, and it wasn't something even his lawyer knew about. Now my dad is upset with me because he thinks he can't say anything to me because I'll just go to my mom. I'm not talking to my mom right now because she took something I told her because I thought she would be concerned about me and instead just used it to her own advantage. Thankfully Friday and Saturday were pretty uneventful because I don't believe I could handle any more disappointment this week. Sorry for the rant, but it was kinda therapeutic to get it off my chest. It's nice to know that there are a couple people out there who will read this just so I'm not the only person who has to carry this shit. Even if I don't get any pizza, it's nice knowing that fact.  TL;DR: Cunt teacher, rumors at work leading to cut hours, cracked engine block, can't talk to either of my parents right now. Just another average week. 
2059	True	a	The kids I watch got signed up for summer camp last minute, so all of my working hours are gone. I'm waiting at home now for a few phone calls about jobs, but it's not looking great for being able to eat much more than rice and beans or pasta until the 15th, so a pizza sounds super fantastic, especially after seeing [this](http://redd.it/1fc8e4). It's my first post here, sorry if anything is amiss, thanks for reading!   Edit: I won a contest and got pizza'd! Thanks for being awesome, I'll be sure to pass it on. :D
2060	False	a	So, my curcumstance is that I am hungry. I live with my girlfriend and a friend and we have pretty much no food in the house. We have bread, but we ran out of raman yesterday and it is raining. Yesterday all I ate was a bowl of raman and two pieces of bread, and today I have been looking at the clock and thinking about pizza. I am not starving to death, but I would like a warm pizza to fill our stomachs. Also, I lost my wallet with my cards and a bit of cash over a week ago, I am not a deadbeat, but just having a hardish time. Can a man get a pizza for my girlfriend and brother? (refereed to as friend earlier as we are not blood related or related by marriage) I live in California, in Los Angeles County. I will give anymore info as requested.  I come from another forum and I asked if they could help by giving a coupon for a free pizza or something and they suggested I come here. Thank you for taking the time to read my post.
2061	False	a	Hi all, Im a 20yr university student struggling thorugh a Bsc in maths. Money is tight for all students but im constantly finding my self stuck in an endless loop of C's. Pizza would be amazing and would lift my spirts but as I live in Auckland, New Zealand I highly doubt there is anyone who can actually buy pizza for me over here... Thanks for reading anyway.
2062	False	a	Been out of work, had a job interview today... didn't go so well. It was for a translation job basically, got there and found out the hard way that they are only seeking someone who can read Traditional Chinese fluently.  I only read Simplified Chinese. Whoops. I walked in, felt really good, but then that happened... Just feel kinda dumb. Didn't even let me speak to an interviewer or anything, threw my papers from the translation test away XD.  Can I get a pizza? I was counting on getting a free one from Domino's but they ended that promo and now I'm screwed XD. Pizza or no, any cheerful comments would be appreciated as well :)
2063	False	a	I have my grandfather visiting my family and we had premade a meal to eat tonight.  However, it was frozen and is taking forever to cook.  We decided to say screw it and maybe have pizza.  My wife doesn't believe something like this subreddit is possible, help me prove her wrong!
2064	False	a	Long story short, been looking for a job to no avail - bills are adding up, and I've got very little money for food this month. Also - food stamps have not been gotten yet, went today to the DHS but don't have an appointment for another 2 days.   If anyone could help out I'd really appreciate it, I can make a drawing or write you a poem, lend you a book, anything!  
2065	False	a	Could use a cheesey slice of heaven right now. If someone helps me out then when I get paid I'll help another out. There isn't much info here because I hate begging but I could really use the help. 
2066	False	a	I am recently unemployed and had to move back in with my parents. I'm incredibly appreciative of them allowing me to stay with them but I feel terribly guilty about the financial burden I am putting on their already thinly stretched wallets.   I would be very grateful to anyone who could provide a meal that is not on my parents' dime. I am in the Iowa area and have a verification code and hope to find some way to repay anyone's kindness.
2067	False	a	im looking to get some help! my oldest just got his very first 100 on his spelling test (he has dyslexia) so this is a big deal!!! My other to have been very understanding and helpful taking care of their younger brother (hes 2) who is sick with a cold!! Id love to get them some pizza but I am broke until Friday when I get pd!! Can anyone help?? We have a dominos here locally for delivery...I even have a verification code if someone tells me how it works! 
2068	False	a	So, I'm from NY. I haven't tried the pizza in Hayward yet as I'm a new student. I thought a fun way to break fast would be with pizza, so does anyone feel like helpin'? Earn your sawab today! :D
2069	False	a	"Hey, me llamo David, and I attend Full Sail University Online and live in Florida.  My living expense check is sent out on Thursday, but my roommate doesn't get paid until Friday, so I was wondering if someone could gift us a pizza?  I can return the favor in a week or two, or I'll pay it forward to someone else.    There are some pretty good deals for large pizzas here at our local pizza hut.  I'm easy to appease.  Don't even need any toppings if it's cheaper.   Thanks ahead of time.  Raaaaawr.  I'm fluent in velociraptor, and that was ""thank you"".  Or ""you smell of feet"", those two phrases are pretty tricky.    Also, my bank account, for your viewing pleasure. Mock the poor boy.    http://oi43.tinypic.com/ny68zk.jpg  EDIT: So it kinda sounds like I want a bunch of pizza.  Just one.  We don't eat much, so it should last until tomorrow.  "
2070	False	a	I love pizza
2071	False	a	Hi, I've gotten laid off a little bit ago, and tired of not getting any calls or interviews. I don't like giving sob stories and I feel a little embarrassed even asking for food, but would really enjoy a pizza if someone can maybe help me out. If you need any proof, I'd be glad to provide some. 
2072	True	a	"Hey guys! I've been craving pizza lately, and have enough money to buy for myself but I figured in the spirit of RAOP, I need to give back. So here's the idea I'd like to pitch:  I'm willing to send cookies (of your choice!! although I've been keen on making some bacon choco chip ones lately) to the sender of my pizza, and another random person (or maybe 2. or 3. probably from [/r/RandomActs Of Cookies](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfCookies/)). I've also got some ideas on how to send cupcakes that I'd like to try as well. I'm a pretty damn good baker so I hope this attempt of ""paying it forward"" is sufficient.  I should also mention I'm in B.C., but willing to ship anywhere! "
2073	False	a	We (myself and 4 kids) are out of food until I get paid on Friday and would love to have a pizza. I promise to pay it back right away when I get paid Friday!  One pie will be plenty for the 5 of us and we don't need toppings, just plain is great.  We have Oizza Hut &amp; Domino's near us. The kids  will eat breakfast &amp; lunch in school tomorrow and can share the big can of beefaroni tomorrow night.   This really isn't as serious as it sounds, I do work full time and will have a paycheck Friday, so we will not starve to death if nobody gets us a pizza tonight.  We're kind of used to it and at least have relief on Friday!  Thanks for reading :)  
2074	False	a	My SO and I are moving to the new apartment tomorrow which has put us in the poor house (paid first and last months rent upfront) so we currently have a combined total of $0.65  We've been frugal with food, meaning lots of rice and KD, but our dishes / food are packed up and my midnight prego cravings have hit hard.   And Pizza Pizza closes in an hour. D:  Anyone care to donate a pepperoni pizza? Pretty please!
2075	True	a	I've got some food to hold me over until friday if I'm creative w/ my meals but I've only got $10 in my wallet and anything left in the bank is going in my tank to get to work. I've had a rough weekend and I could use a pizza tonight. I'll pay it forward on payday.
2076	True	a	Hey guys, so as the title implies I'm a college student attending Florida State University. I'm currently studying in the library and could really use a pizza. Unfortunately I'm also broke until the end of the week. I'm hoping someone generous makes my day!
2077	False	a	I recently moved from California to Lynchburg, Virginia... A very big change of pace. And didn't realize that city life is so much easier. I have a bad knee from a previous injury and didn't know everything would be soooo far apart. Now I need to save for a car.. with no income. So everything I have with me, has to go to hopefully finding a cheap vehicle.  A pizza would be very nice right now. My luck has not been so great. 
2078	False	a	I work in Freemont, because of rent I am already broke even after I get paid on Friday.  Pizza would be amazing, you can only eat so much ramen you know.
2079	False	a	I posted earlier but I forgot to tag it, my boyfriend comes home from work in three hours and we are broke until friday. It would make his night to have pizza!!! 
2080	False	a	Ok maybe it's because I only slept 3 hours, but after reading the sidebar I can't for the life of me figure out how to respond to a request. Help?
2081	False	a	My husband and I will be celebrating our 9th anniversary tomorrow. Unfortunately we do not have any money to actually do something or go anywhere but we will enjoy each others company probably watching some tv and just relaxing.  I would love to surprise hubby with a pizza from anywhere in the area, he is not picky and this would make a great anniversary present.  If anyone could help me out I would so appreciate it.  Eventually when we get back on our feet I would pay it forward!
2082	True	a	I'm currently sitting at work with an empty stomach and an emptier bank account. I'm struggling to stay afloat, but a full docket of bills and college expenses have me running thin this month. I get paid next Friday, and I can give you the promise that I will pay it forward, one way or another.  EDIT: Thanks, mvs5191! You are truly awesome!
2083	False	a	I'm so sick of pizza but I love those little dominos sandwichs. Does any one have a coupon for them? I'm stuck at work and they are $9 delivered. Plus I'm broke.  Please help I don't want to buy gas station food :(
2084	False	a	I just moved got a place with my friend! Excited but at the same time it doesn't leave much in the bank if you know what I mean. Its been the first of the month and we have budgeted well and used our resources sparingly. It is now almost near the end of our journey and we find our selves on the couch wondering how many cup of noodles have we eaten? Frankly, I can stick it out and so can my friend.... but it would be awesome to eat something that's not SOUP! :) me and my friend would appreciate anything
2085	False	a	I moved in with my grandma in Seattle who doesn't grocery shop at all and only buys takeout for herself. I'm paying for college and work for not much money and can't afford to buy a lot of food. I ate mostly oatmeal I found in the cupboard for a week. I also got high for the first time in a few months and that's making me extra hungry. So it's a combination of actual hunger with added munchies.
2086	False	a	Im in 9th grade and live in minnesota. Last week (dec 3-7) i had to stay up all night 3 days in a row to finish homework. I am fairly proud of myself for persevering through it and wanted to buy myself a pizza, but being a broke 15 year old, i can't...     
2087	True	a	I know Christmas eve is tomorrow, but I figured if I posted now this might be seen. Here's the deal, I am a mom of 2 little ones (4 and 1). I will be doing all the Santa duty tomorrow night: wrapping, stockings, putting together toys and trying to make it look like someone visited lol. My husband has to work so this will be the first year I am going solo. (Ironically he works at Pizza Hut lol...unfortunately they dont allow employees free pizza). Anyways, it would make my night much easier to have a pizza delivered. Figured I would ask :)We have a Dominoes, Papa Johns, and Pizza Hut locally.  Thanks for reading even if I dont get my pizza.Happy Holidays!  I used the new Verification system in the sidebar so anyone who offers, I can PM my verification code to prove I am not a scammer.
2088	False	a	My husband is not able to find a job and I am working at a job with very few hours just trying to make ends meet until next payday and failed this week. Please help if you can if not thakyou for reading anyway and god bless.
2089	True	a	hey there gods and goddesses first I want to thank you for what you all do.   now on to my condition. I recently got in a car accident, the bills aren't too bad but they took them all out of my account at once so now my account is overdrafted and I have no food to eat till I get paid on Monday. please help me out, ill pay you back and pay it forward to someone else.
2090	True	a	Today's the day I have to buckle down and get my reading done for the week so that I don't fall behind.  The fiancee is at work and there's no food in the house.
2091	False	a	"Hi all.    LOL....I've been staring at this page for quite a while trying to get up the nerve to ask for a pizza.  I wrote it once, went to get the verification code as it stated I should and came back to find I have to start from scratch!  Yes, newcomer, stands out bright and clear, I'm sure, lol.  O.K.    I had only recently been back to work.  Hours and paychecks have been small but workable.  However, I have had to say ""no"" so many times to family that I would like to offer a ""yes"" for a change.  If anyone can help, I would be able to pay it forward in a week, or repay giver.  Whichever works here.  Thank you.  :) "
2092	False	a	No money to buy food right now but if someone would be kind enough to feed me I would be incredibly grateful and promise to pay it forward as soon as I am able to!  Thank you reddit!
2093	True	a	All I have to get me through until Friday is a few packs of ramen and oatmeal. First time in this Sub-Reddit thought I would give it a try.
2094	False	a	I would love a pizza right now. I don't have much money and am really craving a pizza. Please help, it'd be awesome.
2095	True	a	I'm on my last dollar until they pay. Which completely blows. I'm a college student who has been going through a rough patch this year and a pizza would be nice.. :)  Thanks! 
2096	False	a	http://imgur.com/a/zqQMR Holy crap - I also just realized my DL expires today.....
2097	False	a	I recently lost my girlfriend of 4 years to another man, and got laid off in the same week.  I've been able to scrape by for a few weeks but I'm running out of money. I could just really use a pizza today but i cant afford it. 
2098	False	a	Haven't eaten anything these last two days hoping Reddit can help!
2099	False	a	Anyone mind on sending a special pizza over to Belgium? Would loooooove to try something different than the normal ham, cheese stuff... ;-) Also, I'll keep looking out for RAOP's to help in Belgium.
2100	False	a	Hi. I just started school and am currently super broke because of it and I don't get paid until Tuesday morning... Anything is better than nothing. Any help would be much appreciated.  Florida.
2101	True	a	I have been producing for over two years now with Ableton Live.  Some of my previous works can be heard here: www.soundcloud.com/djlactose  Just let me know what kind of music you'd like me to make for you in exchange.  I'm open to doing remixes as well.    I'm going to college in Colorado.  Let me know!
2102	True	a	"I wish I was making this story up, but unfortunately this has been real life for the last couple of weeks.  My boyfriend and I decided to move into this awesome house because he's going back to school and it makes his commute significantly shorter.  Our new landlord is awesome and told us, since the house is already empty, we could start moving our stuff a couple weeks early so that it makes our move easier, awesome right? So, last Monday comes along and I decide to give her a call.  She doesn't answer so I leave a message, no answer.  Tuesday comes and still no call back.  I have to go to Portland that weekend for a baby shower and my Aunt's birthday party, come back Sunday and still no call back.  She calls me this Monday and tells me cheerfully they've been at the beach all week. I pick up the keys later that day and I've been moving car loads of stuff between work.  We planned on moving today since the beginning of the month, so I scheduled this particular carpet cleaner that our current landlord says we have to use for Thursday (he's very popular in town so there's no way to reschedule). So then, last night as I'm cleaning our place and getting ready for the move, our current landlord rings our doorbell.  She tells me that they are ""resealing"" our road tomorrow and that the road will be completely closed to our driveway from 6AM-6PM.  I start to panic so she gives me the phone number of the guy who is in charge of this project.  I give him a call and he is a TOTAL jerk about it.  At first I was trying to be polite to him in an effort to have him help me out, but I soon realized he wasn't going to help me out (or even apologize for that matter).  Now we can't even start moving until 6PM tonight, which is sort of a nightmare because my brother and his wife are helping us move and I feel pretty guilty about making them move that late.  I've spent a lot of my time (and not to mention expenses) on this move and I am pretty stressed and frustrated.  If someone would send a pizza to our new place it would make me (and I'm sure my brother...he loves pizza) the happiest mover that has ever walked the planet!"
2103	True	a	I just started one of those awesome jobs where you only get paid once a month. It's been a bitch not being able to claim unemployment the last few weeks and currently have [less than adequate funds.](http://i.imgur.com/ls8TW.jpg) Anyone willing to help a guy out? Pretty much been living on ramen and toaster shakens that last couple days.
2104	False	a	New To this. I just found this off WUAH. SO hopefully this will work? Due to finaces things are tight. I promise to return a favor when i can.! thank you and hope everyone has a great day!!! 
2105	False	a	Would much appreciate any who could fulfill this craving.  Edit: I found a way to get my pizza, please give one to someone more deserving.  Thank you
2106	False	a	Dammit, I forgot the location. I'm sorry! Location is **St. John's, NL, Canada**  Today, I moved. I spent the past 2 hours throwing boxes and a bed onto a truck, dragging that across the city, and then hurling it into a new bedroom. It has been 27 degrees here in St. John's (80F) and the humidity isn't exactly being kind either. I've already taken a shower. I feel like a new one.  I could make food, I'm not going to lie. I've got boneless/skinless chicken breasts downstairs, I've got pasta and sauces, I've got marshmallows. However, I'd really just like to kick up on Canada Day, relax, and munch on some pizza. Can provide any proof you'd like.
2107	True	a	"I have been working for about a month now at my new job, and yesterday was my first paycheck. Instead of mailing ME my paycheck, they accidentally sent it to some random address in pennsylvania, and now I have to wait until next week when they can void my previous check and then mail me another one, since its ""company policy"" to not have paychecks sent to where I work. If someone can please help me with a pizza I would be eternally grateful, I am at my wits end, and I could really use a hot meal. Please someone help me out!  EDIT: I have received a pizza before from jerematic, I had put up a request and jerematic had put up an offer shortly after, after getting the pizza from jerematic I deleted my request since I had already gotten a pizza. Thanks Matt_and_Chelle for the help!"
2108	False	a	My girlfriend and I live together and usually rely on her pell grant money to get us through the semester. Unfortunately, this year, we were both denied financial aid. Luckily a member of her family took out a loan so she could go to school. I cannot. So here we are, knowing our paychecks are going to pay our late rent instead of food, which we have run out of. Tomorrow i plan to go sell some things to the pawn shop to get us through for a while. But we haven't eaten today. I know this is asking for a lot. But I don't see us being able to eat for at least another two days. Could someone help us out? Thank you for reading this.
2109	True	a	My husband has been out of work due to an accident outside of his job. I just payed the rent for the upcoming month and I now have spent the last of my money for the next two weeks. I would love to suprise my husband with a pizza as our food has dwindled down to canned vegetables and bread. I will return the favor as soon as I am able. Thanks for your time.
2110	False	a	We're just sitting here near indianapolis on our nights off, wishing we had something other than poptarts to eat tonight. Just pulled a double at work but there is no room in the budget to splurge. Groceries this week consisted of tuna and white bread...and I'm pretty damn tired of tuna at this point. We're pretty nice people so we're hoping karma will help us out! We promise to post a special [thank you] and pay it forward ASAP!!
2111	False	a	I asked for help in r/assistance and someone was kind enough to give me $45 for help on my credit card a week ago. Now I'm out of groceries and  the credit card bill is getting dangerously higher. This pizza would GREATLY help me out.  I'll pay it forward as soon as I start getting my steady income back!  Edit:  dontlikerainbows helped me out! I now have food to tide me over until Tuesday!
2112	False	a	I have not eaten for 9 hours i need some food. preferably a meat lovers lol. c: 
2113	False	a	Hey Reddit. It's almost finals week and me and my roomate are studying hard. We've been living off of ramen for days now, and I would love to be able to get him something to eat that isn't salted noodles. If you could help we would appreciate it.   
2114	False	a	My grandmother passed away 2 years ago. I grew up a block away so I played at her house often growing up. When the opportunity came to buy her 96 olds, it was like a little piece of her was back with me. That was until today. I was at work during a blizzard, and was relieved when the store closed early. Driving home on a main highway, a truck backed out while he was plowing a parking lot. I couldn't stop. I wasn't injured except from a cut from the airbag and a bump on the knee. Here's my proof. http://i.imgur.com/0LbolU1.jpg. I hate asking, but could some one help me out? I could care less about the car, accidents happen. But the fact that it was my grandmas...that crushed me.
2115	True	a	Hello! I come to this site looking for a little help getting through a little bit of a tough time. I'm just getting over being sick as a dog. Shingles aren't pretty. I had a few sick days, but I was out for a bit longer than I thought I'd be, so my check is going to be a little short. A pizza dinner would be great. This isn't a real need, but my expecting wife has been craving pizza and my son is doing really well in school. We are a small family and don't need much. We'll pay it back when I can catch up in a few weeks.  Thank you!
2116	False	a	I'm not malnourished or broke or anything, just bored. Throw out your offer and I'll see what I can do.
2117	True	a	I broke my leg racing my dirtbike in hare scrambles. Been laid up flat broke without insurance since the 15th. A pizza that there's no way I could afford at this point would totally blow my mind. I fully intend to pay this favor forward once I can provide for myself again.  *edit* Forgot to include location, I live in Minnesota  *edit2* request fulfilled by throwawayporksalad
2118	False	a	First time asker, long time lurker.  My roommate gets off work in a few hours and we plan to marathon s2 of game of thrones. Surprising him with pizza, and feeding myself of course, would be the best thing ever! We haven't been able to afford much food lately since he is now unable to sell plasma after a complication last time, so we're always a bit hungry.   Thanks so much in advance!
2119	False	a	I'm broke till next Friday, but I'm in such a need of a pizza right now!  No sob story here; I have food at my apartment, but I don't think any of it is gonna hit the spot like a nice slice right about now.  And I really want something to help with hangover right now.  If this works I plan on paying forward Friday.  If you wanted to determine the criteria for the pizza I give away I would be game for that!
2120	False	a	The things we do for our pets...
2121	True	a	I am a mythical creature and I've got a giant sized craving for some pizza! Actually I'm just a man, but the part about the giant sized craving is true. So if it be in your heart to randomly buy some poor stranger a pizza, let it be me.   Thank you! I am yours sincerely, Witherwings
2122	True	a	I lost my debit card last night and don't currently have a vehicle to go get a new one... so I have no money until tomorrow at least. Anyone want to help me out with a pizza? 
2123	False	a	As of last month we went from having three jobs between us to just one. But between my remaining job and her unemployment checks we're not doing too bad considering, but having just payed the rent on the 3rd, we're completely tapped out. Her check should come tomorrow and I'll get paid on Friday, but we need to eat today. Would any random stranger be willing to help us out? I don't want to be a charity case so, I'd even be willing to pay you back when we get our money or pizza it forward. Thanks for reading!  **UPDATE**: SpeakerCity was kind enough to help a brother out! My pizza is already on the way. Thank you for offering, Lakerz4life and IrritableOwlSyndrome, too.
2124	False	a	I'm dealing with some severe depression, caused by mental illness and right now all my money is being thrown at my doctors to help me get through this. I have little food in my home, all of which needs to last me until the 8th when I can go grocery shopping again. I'm feeding myself, so I don't need a lot, really anything will help. I'm in Salem, OR if that helps any. Thanks.  -Keasbey15
2125	False	a	I had no idea this subreddit existed. Very cool stuff.  Anyway, I'm supposedly going to start working an on-campus gig for the University of Arizona soon, but the person responsible for the job has been dragging their feet hardcore. Bank account is in the shit, I don't own any credit cards, and the only thing I have in my house is a can of tuna. I don't even like tuna.  Probably not as deserving as a single mom, but college kids gotta eat, too! And if you're a local I will take you out for a drink once I start working :)
2126	False	a	Please pm me for my address. I'll be up all night and all day tomorrow. I don't think I'll be sleeping well for a few nights.
2127	True	a	My family and friends are away and I'm out of cash to do anything. This would be an awesome present :)  Edit: I'm in NYC
2128	True	a	I'm honestly not the kind of girl to ask for handouts, but I just can't make ends meet anymore and I don't get paid until Friday. I just spent my last $30 on dog food, because he comes before me.  If anyone would be so kind I promise to pass it on once I am established again. Thanks for reading.
2129	True	a	Received an egift from a person who wishes to stay anonymous thank you so much for helping my family.
2130	False	a	I have no money and would love a pizza  if anyone could help i will pay it back when i can ASAP
2131	False	a	Hi, typical broke college kids here. Boyfriend and I have been really struggling the past week and after catching up on the bills for this month have little under $1 in our bank account.. We were hoping for a random act of pizza to hold us over until my check clears tomorrow so we can actually get groceries. Really appreciate any help!!
2132	False	a	No sob story. I'm just hungover as fuck and would seriously appreciate a delicious, cheesy pizza. Now I'm going to go cry in a corner and try to work out just how many vodka slushies and tequila shots I inflicted on myself last night.  Peace!
2133	False	a	Alas, greater education has taken many things from me, and one of those things is the ability to order pizza whenever. I won't have any money to buy pizza for a few weeks, since it's all going to tuition. Any kind souls willing to help me out?
2134	False	a	i got fired from my job around 2 months ago and now im really broke and trying to get some food.  im a new redditor in kansas city metro (technically in prairie village) im watching my moms house and she bought no food and would love for a friendly person to provide pizza.  will reciprocate for pizza provider at some future date :D 
2135	False	a	I was hoping that my first random act of pizza for myself, but a friend of mine is recently homeless and needs a meal. This being my first request, I really hope it works. I have the address of the hotel in california she is staying at, so I really hope someone can help. I also hope I am doing this right. 
2136	False	a	Pretty much what what the title says. Grandpa was espically great to me, always gave until it hurt. Cannot afford dinner out for him so I would love to surprise him. 
2137	False	a	My hard working dad works as a wholesale selling electronics in NY and business is slow lately and he isn't making money like he used to. My mother is a stay-at-home mother who has never had a job in her life and our family has a very tight budget. While some people may say to get off yar lazy arse and get a job, quite frankly in my situation its impossible as of right now. I'm too busy to get a job again to maintain my grades and enough sleep each night so that option is out of the picture.  All I'm asking for is a simple medium/large pizza, that's all, it would really make my day for a stranger on the internet to perform such an act of kindness.
2138	False	a	Student, had a test today and couldn't get to the plasma donation center in time so I could eat today.  A pizza would really hit the spot and tide me over until I can get some cash in the next few days and pay it forward.  Thanks for any considerations or help.
2139	False	a	Here's the deal. I have $-3.80 in my bank account (damn sallie mae) and all I have to eat until I go home for easter on Wednesday is three boxes of spegetti which I would like to make last. If someone would be awesome enough to get me a pizza I promise to return the favor (pizza of equal value). All I am looking for is a $5 pizza from my local 24 hour Domino's. 
2140	False	a	So... this is finals week, and I figured a responsible way of bracing myself for exams would be......catching up on Futurama/Adventure Time/Fullmetal Alchemist episodes while EATING PIZZA !! Isn't it an awesome idea ?  Also my battleplan involves a blanket and tea, and extreme denial of the imminence of exams ;)   The only erm, slight problem I encountered in my GENIUS project. Is that I'm kinda broke, and fishfingers and cereals only last you so long before you are too broke to have pizza but too proud/ashamed to beg your family to send you enough to last the month :/ Anyone ever experienced this ?  So if anyone feels like sending a bit of cheesy food to Dublin, Ireland, it would really brighten up the whole *week* :D of a broke but happy female Economics and Politics college student. (not sure if there's a rule to specify stuff about myself to prove I'm real but, yeah, here ou go haha)  If infos are needed or something to prove I'm real PM me please, also I'm not sure how to give my adress or...(?) (sorry about the awkwardness, it's my first time creating a topic instead of just commenting. Stomach made me do it)  PS: Sorry for any second-language slips or grammatical atrocities. English isn't my native language. (France yaaay)   
2141	False	a	I am new to Reddit, after reading several threads I doubt I'd have a chance, this isn't a sob story nor am I begging, but today is my daughters 9th birthday, I've been working my butt off just to keep our home, I got my daughter a birthday card and that's all I could afford, although I plan on making it up to her I just want her to be able to have something special today and I can't even provide a decent meal to her today, if someone could help me make my little girls birthday special I'd appreciate it. I feel terrible asking I've always been the independent one, but I really just want to turn this day around.   I can provide whatever is needed to be provided to make this happen.
2142	False	a	Paid a buddy back, but it crushed my wallet. I could use some help guys.
2143	False	a	Hey Reddit, Me and my friends are all pretty high, we're all also now starving, with nothing but frozen mice (for my snake) and coffee in the house we could really use a pizza. We spent all our money on weed, you know how it is. Please empathise with our situation Reddit. Peace!
2144	False	a	For some weird reason the Pizza Hut in my area doesn't let you use your egiftcard through the online website-- they make you go there in person to do it. I am sick and have no car, and the bus doesn't run on weekends, so...  Would anyone like to trade? 
2145	False	a	I'm out of funds until Wednesday and there's no food left.  I'm really, really hungry and if anyone could help me out it would be phenomenal.  
2146	False	a	No real sob story here or anything, just craving on my birthday. Cheers
2147	False	a	As the title says i only got $30 left untill friday, i already ate all the frozen food i got and the fridge is empty... i feel lame not having breakfast but if any kind person could help me today i will double what you give me on friday. =]
2148	False	a	a simple cheese pizza would be a nice break from the ramen :3  **Edit** it appears I didn't give enough info. I live in Thomaston, CT (I'll give the rest in a personal message xP) I can't do much to thank you, I can try drawing a pokemon for you :D hmm...can't think of a way to express the please well enough so I'll just leave [this](http://images.intomobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/cat-please-pic.jpg) :3
2149	False	a	So this isn't a sob story, I just want to finally have a gluten free pizza tonight for the return of Whose Line! I'm pretty sure Domino's is the only chain that has gluten free pizza, but if anyone else knows a place that has some I would be grateful to know about it! (I hope it's at least close to being as good as a regular pizza....oh god I miss it so much)
2150	False	a	Have pizza'd one person before, and it felt good, and I've had a good week personally, but a few choice encounters with some individuals this week has left me less than joyful about being part of the human race. Along with the fact that my current financial stability is about to plummet due to some big purchases that I'm just glad I was prepared for, a pretty pie would be the best. I have little to offer in return except for making balloon animals, but I'm awesome at making them! :D If you are in the area maybe we could even hit up a pizza shop together and I'll bring all my circus fun stuff. :) 
2151	False	a	I am very hungry dont have anymoney and there is no food send me a e-giftcard please
2152	False	a	i'm an fiu student with .30 cents in my bank account for the next week craving some pizza to munch on while i work my way through a twelve page paper. everything on campus where i could use my meal plan is closed. help a girl out?
2153	False	a	  I'm doing this for my roommate. He's dealing with a ton of stress at the moment. His mom just went into hospice care this week with terminal brain &amp; lung cancer. His birthday's on Saturday, &amp; he's got to work all weekend.  As you can imagine, he's an emotional wreck, &amp; I just want to try &amp; lift his spirits as best I can.    We've got a Papa John's &amp; 2 Pizza Hut's in town.  Any help from anyone would be awesome.  Thanks.
2154	True	a	$0.33 in bank account, savings restricted due to online transfer limit being reached, and not getting payed for 10 days. I work and am in class constantly, but I barely make ends meet. This month is exceptionally bad for me and I haven't had constant access to food. Any help would be appreciated!
2155	True	a	It's ten here, but we're going to be up for some time and even if we don't finish it off tonight, we'll *definitely* eat it for breakfast because we're champions like that.   So yeah, keeping it short but can anyone help us out? It would make this weekend perfect. 
2156	True	a	I am really trying to finish my first project till the end of this week, I am now really stressed out as I fell behind with my previous plan and am currently running out of ideas about what to write, have to work everyday at 6pm which significantly cuts my time to fully dedicate the entire day to my university projects, staying at work till 1am.   I am financially dried out and get paid on the 25th which is next week. I would appreciate pepperoni pizza if anyone would be willing to help. There is Domino's pizza here in Canterbury, UK.   Cliche maybe, I know... but I am telling the truth... (the good old: who would lie on the internet, right? :) )  Thanks!!!  
2157	True	a	[EDIT] GREAT SUCCESS. Thanks @ Choppersb!  Hey all, I'm a student in graphic design who just finished his summer quarter and portfolio only to be left with no money for the next week. My philadelphian ass would kill for a pizza or even a slice of bread at this point. I get paid the first of the month, but with an empty fridge and cupboard, I'll end up eating my toenails in the mean time.  If you can help me out, I'll be sure to pass the kindness along come the first--Ill even keep a donate(r) in the loop so that they can see the chain reaction ;)  OMNOMNOM !
2158	True	a	My boyfriend (fellow redditor) and I don't have much beyond rice and peanut butter sandwiches (LIVING THE DREAM.) and won't get money for about a week.   If you get us a pizza, I'll make you a drawing of whatever you like! I have a gallery here, you can choose whether it's worth much. http://auto-de-filet.deviantart.com/
2159	False	a	Hey reddit im really hungry and have no money left for food. this is my last resort for the day. if anyone is feeling generous it would be AMAZING.
2160	False	a	we are decorating the Christmas tree and I would like to have a few pizzas for the kids this is not a must have but I know it would be something they would enjoy. we have papa johns pizza inn and dominoes that deliver to our home anyone that may help we will be so very thankful!
2161	False	a	boyfriend left my son and me and took all our money and the car. pizza sounds good. can how proof if needed buddykeiko@hotmail.com is my e-mail
2162	False	a	Having issues with my back so having trouble standing for long periods and on vicodin for a slipped disc that is pressing on a nerve... havent had anything to eat and havent been able to make it to the store with my back and all these meds on an empty stomach is starting to not make me feel too well. Would greatly appreciate a pizza, cant afford one myself since I have no money, last of it spent on copays (have my disability hearing in feb). Sorry if my post if a bit random but kinda loppy at the moment.
2163	False	a	Just like the title says, I have no food at my house and no money to buy any with. At least not for the next week. Pretty sure I could make a pizza go pretty far.   (I guess that's a lie...I have some protein powder on top of my fridge).   Located in San Francisco, CA!
2164	False	a	I'm broke and hungry and im streaming movies for friends, the assholes wont even feed me :P will reddit?  on this site : https://www.thuisbezorgd.nl/en/checkout-order-chicken-house-shoarma  they got an english site, take paypal and creditcards
2165	False	a	Maybe a bit of a longshot here but, if anyone would be willing to chip in that'd be awesome. I could explain her situation in detail if you'd like to hear it. 
2166	False	a	I'm in my gf's appt and I'm glued to the stool. It's actually -33 C or something outside. I got to a (10) outside on the Rideau Mall terrace... Then the frostbite started coming... Ran back to the appt and am currently defrosting. Extreme munchies kicking in. Backup support requested!
2167	False	a	No sob story here. Just a little tight on cash until next Friday, and do not want to eat Ramen everyday until then. I make decent money for my age, but have to pay off college loans and other living expenses. I took some time off to do family stuff for the 4th of July and just didn't pull in the kind of money I'm used to these past pay checks. I'll be back to normal next Friday, but was just hoping I could have the indulgence of having a pizza before then. Hopefully I can repay the favor to another fellow redditor in need of some delicious cheesy goodness once I get my next pay check :)  (Northwest Florida Panhandle) if that needs to be clarified.
2168	False	a	"[This sane family is going hungry because they refuse to murder their rape victim daughter.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ku0tg/pakistani_family_refuses_to_kill_daughter_who_was/)  ""We go hungry many nights,"" said Kainat's older sister. That made me think of /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza. Are there some Pakistani Redditors that could help, or help us help this family?"
2169	False	a	I've been laid off since June and while my wife makes enough to keep us (us and two boys) afloat; we've had to cut way back and we've been living without any extras. Great news is she just got a raise, which she'll get on her next pay check. RAoP'ers, would anyone care to help us into this home stretch with one crazy night of cheesy goodness? Thanks for listening.
2170	False	a	So, I've had a lot going on in my life right now, my girlfriend just broke up with me, and my whole families been going through a awful divorce, and I just keep being put in the middle of it.  By no means would a pizza solve all my problems, but, as silly as it seems, it would be nice to get something from someone for a change.
2171	False	a	So I just found out that I won't be paid at all this month because of some bookkeeper issues. I work in a small neighborhood cooperative and don't make that much to begin with, but this kinda puts me in a dangerous spot with summer electric bills and increasing rent. I know they can't turn off electricity in the summer, so I might go without paying for a few months. A friend turned me on to this subreddit, so I thought I would see if anyone could help out a redditor in New Orleans. I promise to pay it forward as soon as I can :)
2172	False	a	I lost my wallet Tuesday. I am unable to get cash from the bank because they are a credit union located in another city three hours away (my hometown). I have to wait for a new debit card to come in the mail. Should be any day now, but in the meantime I would love a hot pizza. I can only eat what's left in the house, and I'm running out quickly. I would love to pay it forward once I get my card in the mail. Can someone help me out please? 
2173	True	a	My roommate and I have both just moved into a new apartment recently and are hurting financially post-holiday/move. We would love if someone could forward us a pizza- Friday is payday and I will gladly return the favor. We also have a very hungry cat that won't get off my keyboard.  Thanks! We're in Austin, in case you wanted to creep.
2174	False	a	A pizza tonight would be absolutely wonderful, but I'm on a beans and rice budget until I can finally find a new means of employment. I reside in Walnut, California. We have a local Pizza hut, and there's a Domino's and a Papa Johns just down the street from my place. I'll gladly accept absolutely anything, from anywhere. Even something as simple as plain cheese would be awesome. I'm a cheap date.   This is my first time posting here, so I'm not entirely sure how this works. I'll keep tabs on my post over the course of the next hour or two in the hope it's seen by anyone willing to help. In return I can either pay it forward when I can, or order a pizza for you down the road once I'm back on my feet. Thanks in advance  :)  *Edit - I know, I know....my choices aren't exactly ideal, but alas those are the three closest options. I'm not exactly in a position to be picky, so even Domino's sounds great right now. But I don't have a preference between the three. Whatever is the cheapest still works for me.   *Edit 2 - If you were planning on ordering a pie or two tonight and you're willing to share, I'd be happy to join you as long as it's a public setting. I'm still unsure how this all works....am I supposed to provide a phone number and an address to someone via PM?   *Edit 3 - Well, this isn't getting any attention and my stomach is gurgling all the same, so I'm just going to scrounge for the evening. Short of a miracle in the job department I'm still going to be nearly broke tomorrow and a little while beyond, so if anyone would like to help me out another day, that would still be great.  
2175	False	a	Well here's the tedious lifestory this morning both my parents left for work, and towards the afternoon i felt famished so i went to get some and i saw i only had ¬£5 i though it'd be enough for atleast a burger or something so i tried ordering one but they said it has to be over ¬£10 for delivery, and i can't go out as mum took my key :| can anyone feed me with pizza in return i give you ESET NOD32 Anivirus 5 key :D  TL;DR: ¬£5 Not enough, buy me pizza get ESET NOD32 Key
2176	False	a	It's the first all nighter of the quarter and we are starting to get hungry! Unfortunately, too much money spent on project supplies and not enough left over for pizza. Thanks!
2177	False	a	Just dropped $400 on textbooks, $202 on a parking pass, $350 for my half of the rent, and have a $95 electric bill to pay next week, and now my ex who just dumped me a month ago is bugging me about trying to get back together. Nothing would brighten up my day than a slice of pepperoni.
2178	False	a	I've been working on a Web Publishing final all day, and am finally nearing completion. Though in the process, I forgot to get to the cafe in time to get myself a decent meal. All I've got here is cheese and bread, and while a staple, just isn't enough.  Would anyone care to give a RAOP PapaJohn's e-giftcard? They're the only place around here.  Edit - I suppose I should go ahead and mention I'm in Ohio. :)
2179	False	a	I'm broke as a joke and starving right now.  I've used up the little money I had left over the past few weeks, and don't really know how I'm going to make it through the next few weeks.  I would love to sit down with a nice warm pizza tonight and just say f**k it all.
2180	True	a	So, I just recently graduated from a business college and earned a diploma to work in an office for admin. I was lucky and got a job right out of school. I had to commute to work and a week in my car died, so I went to a dealership to finance one since I didn't have any money saved. Yesterday I just got let go of my job. I posted about it in r/jobs here: http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1kyxcc/i_got_fired_today_out_of_the_blue/ to gain some sort of advice/motivation. Well my new car has been having troubles and I finally had the time to take it in. Well my piece of shit extended warranty doesn't cover any of the things wrong with it and it's going to cost me 2500 like i have that lying around. So if there's any kinda strangers who can help a sista out with a pizza that would be great. I want pizza is kinda code when I'm just super sad. Since I have Celiac Disease and eating pizza is a treat for me now even though there's more options for us people who can't have gluten. Anywho, if there's any kind soul who can afford a pizza that'd be cool. but even a joke or uplifting advice would be cool too. Thanks. And I hope one day I can return the favour. I live in SK Canada by the way.
2181	False	a	Fufilled. Thanks for reading.  Hi there. I'm a 22 year old male who has recently moved. Since moving, I've lost a friend, been mugged at gunpoint, had to replace an alternator, and now I have to replace the struts my car. In fact, it should have been finished a week ago but due to some reasons I'm unaware of it seems that the mechanic I hired has cancelled on me three times and wont even answer the phone at this point. He even has the parts that I paid for sitting on his property. I simply don't have the know how to do so, or I'd do it myself.  As far as losing a friend goes, someone had a change in plans regarding my living situation. I was to stay with her for a few weeks while I found another place. She told me to find a new place pretty much immediately and that I was acting like a child, ect. I wasn't even there half of the time, so I honestly do not know why she went so crazy. It kind of hurt to see her suddenly change like that, since we were friends for so long.  In any case, it's getting pretty rough here lately. I can't leave this end of town for any reason due to my car problems so grocery runs are limited, too. I'm lucky enough to work really close to where I live, so there is limited strain on the car in its [current state](http://i.imgur.com/Z5sdP.jpg). (The strut has recently fallen completely off.) I simply request a pizza. Thanks for reading. I appreciate anything you can offer.
2182	False	a	Out of work pretty recently and cannot seem to find a new job. Putting up my resume to a couple more locations right after this post. Live in NC. Can anyone help a broke struggling redditor out?
2183	False	a	Hey there! I'm new here, and quite pregnant. My name is Cori. I got myself a verification code, whatever that means. I'm active on RAOAmazon. I'm new here, though. I'm on PERMANENT BEDREST until I'm induced in December. I have preeclampsia, which means for no reason than my body hates my baby, I have extremely high blood pressure and I could have a seizure at any moment. (Both my mom and my grandma lost their first children to eclampsia, the onset of the seizures, so I'm GRATEFUL to have knowledge of my condition. The docs say my baby and I should be TOTALLY fine!)  Sorry for the sob story, I know that's not what this wonderful place is about, but I just thought I'd let you know background to WHY I want a pizza! I'm off of work, obvs, because I have to be in bed all day (no more than 5 minutes on my feet at a time!), and ALSO, **my husband can't cook for SHIT**, so I'd like to take some responsibility off of him for the next two nights or so by getting him a fat pizza gift card! We have all the normal joints in our neighborhood, so any gift card would be sweet!  It would help make sure myself and my unborn child are fed something that wasn't burnt and scraped off of the bottom of the wrong pan for the occasion!  Thanks in advance for your
2184	True	a	to post on this again, as the first time I asked I told my story of little money no food for a few weeks someone screamed at me and told me to manage my money a little better, I was startled and scared hell I was even ashamed so I took it down...I'm new to reddit, I can only use it while borrowing a friends comp....so I don't have much of a history, but I don't really know where else to go, I'm not so bad off as in I have enough ramen to last me and my fiance a pack a day for a week, but we've been eating it for a while and would love a hot pizza, if you can help it would be appreciated, if not thanks for looking. thank you. 
2185	True	a	I have no food and not a single cent to my name til Friday not mention a past due bill. Stomach sound awful. Really could use a pie.
2186	False	a	Things didn't go quite as planned and I ended up watching my bf play video games all night in a friend's basement along with the privilege of being DD for the hour-long drive home. I'd just like to feel a bit special, even if it's a day late. 
2187	True	a	I recently went through some problems, and a friend of mine here has taken me in. He is just as broke and works his ass off to take care of both of us. I'm looking for work, but It would be nice to give him something in return. He was just saying to me how much he would love a pizza.  If you can help, it would be very appreciated. I'll send a pic with the pizza and my friend. :)  (I have a verification code also.)
2188	False	a	So I have 23 papa points on my papajohns.com account. If someone who plans to give a pizza today would be so kind as to spend $10 on my papa john's online account, I could get a free pizza care of papajohns.com. It's like a 2for1 gift!
2189	False	a	I'm a student at the University of Arkansas.  There's a gaming lab here on campus called the Student Technology Center.  The staff there does more than just run the gaming lab, though.  They're responsible for tech support all over campus.  These guys work part time, nights and weekends, for minimum wage, and get tons of shit every day from a really thankless and entitled student body.  I wanted to order them some pizza to thank them for what they do, but I'm broke.  Was hoping maybe RAOP could help out.
2190	False	a	Broke college student studying for finals and I have no money to get something to eat. If there is anyone out there that would like to help a poor kid out, it would be much appreciated =D
2191	False	a	Hey RAoP, I'm a student in Raleigh and unfortunately this month has been hard on my wallet. I spent a large chunk of my money on a gift for my girlfriend's birthday and I spent the whole day driving out to get it. On top of that, my university closed its dining hall early tonight because of the holiday so I'm running off of the small amount of snacks I have in my dorm. I would love for some warm food tonight if anyone is generous enough. 
2192	False	a	id really like to have a nice pizza dinner with my family. its been a long time. we had our house destroyed by the hurricane Irene. its still standing but not livable and were told we have to rebuild it. me, my husband and our four kids are staying with my sister. its really hard cuz we were struggling before (i was laid off a few mo ago) and now its just scary sometimes. im going to career centers and applying for jobs, but there just arent any. my husband takes OT when its available. our church is helping us but there are others who need much more and i dont want to take away from them.  we have food on the table. its usually not much more than boiled chicken and instant potatos but were managing. a pizza dinner would be an incredible treat. even my teen and pre-teen would sit down with us if there was pizza! if anyone can help, id be so happy.  thank you
2193	True	a	hello all,  I am a 24 year old guy who just graduated from university. I have a job, but with rent/bills I have no funds until I get paid on Wednesday. I have been eating beans and rice which is not so bad, but its starting to taste like mush. if anyone could help out, id be sure to pay it forward in the near future.   thanks! 
2194	False	a	Hello RAOP. We are 3 guys at work and would like a Pizza we are broke. and lunch time is coming fast. we are starving could you help?  We only have a pizza hut in our little town and its a call in I can give you the number if needed. We will return the favor asap. Thanks so much in advance.   Edit: Flippin Arkansas. ( yes its a real town.)
2195	False	a	No car and I refuse to waste money on gas station food when we were supposed to go tonight. But surprise surprise my friend dicked out on me again. So monday is soonest I will be able to take bus to the giant. Nothing in house except flour, lemonade mix and rice for next 2 days.  Someone make my day?
2196	False	a	Plus, my S.O. took the laptop, so I'm typing this on my kindle.
2197	False	a	I am a moneyless musician in the Southeastern Michigan area. I'm in college and I just had to pay a LOT of bills. I now have but a few cents to my name!   I will write and record you a song for some RAOP loving. If multiple people offer, I will do my best to write and record songs for each of them (hell, leftovers can feed me for days).  Bring on the requests!
2198	False	a	My school is opened these last two days (Monday and Tuesday) for finals even though a lot of people had most of theirs last week. My friend and I have an exam on Tuesday, so we haven't been able to go home early. But what I don't get is why all the food shut down without a prior notice. I've been living on meal swipes this semester, but now their useless and I'm broke, so no going out to eat. I just need a pizzaaaa.
2199	False	a	I'm not poor or anything but my fellow redditor room mate and I are starving and the fridge is kind of on the empty side. Anybody out there wanna help a couple of their fellow redditors!    Louisville, kentucky. Stay classy reddit!
2200	False	a	So my  gf is out of town and I've caught up all the house work so it's time for a well deserved marathon with a neighbor.    I have used all my money towards bills so the spending money is with my gf and I would feel bad asking my neighbor for pizza since he is always broke like myself.  Just wanted to see if anyone would be so kind to hook  us up with  a pizza or 2.  O and don't think  we are skipping  The Hobbit! 
2201	False	a	hey! so i'm hoping someone can help this college student from the north shore of Massachusetts that just returned home to a family with far greater concerns than sticking pizza down my throat. I'm looking for jobs but no luck, per usual, and i'm hoping someone on here is willing to give me something to put in the win column seeing as it's been a while since I've been able to do so.  My email is 5yardfacemask@gmail.com  Thanks for existing everyone that is in this community :)
2202	False	a	"The Infinite Well of Ramen Noodles has run dry. The villagers were greedy, dipping too often into it with the ladle and tongs. Now the children shall starve... unless we can feed them another way?  For a nominal fee of providing edible sustenance that doesn't slurp when I eat it, I shall impart stories of epic proportions based on the whims of the provider. In other words I'll draft a short story based on whatever meaningful or outright ridiculous crap you come up with. Am I any good at writing? Well, I won a Presidential writing award in third grade for an essay I did. I also helped ghost write 2 published works, one of which is in it's fourth printing. The other one was just a paycheck, that lady never stood a chance from the beginning.  The genre is up to you, I can write anything fiction without much trouble. If you want Optimus Prime to viciously beat Rainbow Brite with a broken Buzz Lightyear doll, I'll assemble the necessary back story =). All created works are royalty free, so turn em in to short story contests, publish them in a magazine, whatever.  I am hoping for at least $25 dollars worth of food, I can toss together a good read for that much, and I can eat a couple days off that. But longevity wise I need food for the rest of the week, so the more you donate the longer it'll be. Offer is open to anyone and I will accept up to 3 requests for stories, just make sure if you want something ""romantic"" that it's tasteful or I'll be inclined to turn it down.  That is all, hope I can snag a few jobs and keep the fridge full for a few days, thanks in advance guys =)"
2203	False	a	please i need a pizza! we are so hungry we would love you forever go dawgs
2204	False	a	.
2205	False	a	I have not one item of groceries in my house until I get paid this week and I'm pretty darn hungry.  If someone would be willing to help out it'd really make my day, thanks for any consideration.
2206	False	a	I took an online calculus class (big mistake) followed by an online calculus 2 class (even huger mistake).  I'm taking the calc 2 final tonight and after getting A's on all of my assignments and studying for days, it's looking like it won't go good.  Pizza would really hit the spot.   ALSO - If someone does end up buying the pizza, you can watch me eat it on skype.
2207	False	a	If you want to read more, this is the loan request in r/assistance: http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/13pexq/identity_got_stolen_share_and_share_draft/  I'm already going to assume that no one will give me a loan and I'm going to have to ride it out until next week. I could really use a pizza or something that has a high calorie and triglyceride content so Ican eat a slice before work and power through my shift loading trailers. All I have right now is a cup of parboiled rice and without cash and not knowing any of the cooks at local resturants, I need some help. 
2208	False	a	"This message is for everyone.  I hope you'll all take a moment to read it.  I just sat down to eat a bowl of noodles.  As I said my grace and waited for the food to cool down, I was overwhelmed by a million thoughts.  I just wanted to share them and maybe let someone know they're not alone.  Last week I ""celebrated"" one year of being unemployed.  Ironically it coincided with 6 months of being officially divorced, though the marriage was over long before that.  Today marks two weeks since I scrounged around the house to find every penny and spent them all to cover the bills.  For 2 weeks I've tried to get by without any money.  I've restricted my use of the car to only places I absolutely had to go.  I haven't been to the grocery store in God knows how long.  The first week wasn't awful.  I didn't have much in terms of food around the house, but it forced me to be creative.  This second week has been much less enjoyable.  Some cereal, some pasta, a little of this, and less of that.  You don't realize how long two weeks is until you find yourself counting down every day.  I am hoping to get some relief in terms of an unemployment check on Wednesday.  What I was told though is it could be delayed because I have to re-qualify after one year.  What a proud moment for me.  I've run into issues before, and it doesn't matter that it's not your fault, they usually can't get the money to you until the following Monday.  We'll see how that goes.  I've had Wednesday circled on the calendar in my head as this all magical day.  Realistically most of the money is already spoken for in upcoming bills, but I'll have a little bit of money for grocery shopping.  Right now, and I realize this is a gross combination, I'm craving a glass of milk, and a hamburger :)    Anyway, the short story is that life sucks right now and I was kind of getting down.  Actually I was really in a bad place.  And as I said a blessing over the ""meal"", I realized that there are millions of people that would gladly step into my shoes.  That my life may seem rough right now, but that's more of a testament to how far I had risen, than to how far I've fallen.    I just want to say thank you to all of you on here that are helping people.  It's an honorable calling.  And to all of you that truly need help, just know that it will get better.  I firmly believe that we will never be given more than we can handle, and we're never in it alone.  I know how sad and depressing life can be, but I also know how you don't have to look far to find someone who needs help more than ourselves.    I guess I just wanted to say hang in there.  To everyone.  Keep fighting.  Don't give up.  If you're having a bad day, if you want to rant and rave or scream and cry, send me a message.  If you got that job interview you've been praying for, let me know.  I want to hear the bad.  I want to share in the good.  I have tried to weather the storm alone, and it doesn't work.  I don't need someone to carry me, but it sure is nice to have someone to lean on.  So as Tiny Tim say, ""God bless us, everyone."" "
2209	False	a	Lack of time and income limit me to cook or order dinner as I have 3 exams and 3 assignments due in the next 5 days. I am a pizza head by nature and would love to relax and enjoy a delicious pizza while studying! Definitely will pay it forward in the near future! 
2210	True	a	I would like to request pizza this evening. A friend of mine is coming over to drop off Dexter Season 1 and she is not bringing me any food. I would like to wwtch this show with my young teens and enjoy some Papa Johns or similar. If anyone can help, thanks in advance.
2211	False	a	I don't know what to do.  I suppose I should've seen this coming -- she used to disappear for days on end, and I couldn't make contact with her, let find out where she went -- but nothing can really prepare you for it. We even traveled *across the country* together for college, and now she's gone. From Seattle to North Carolina, for god's sake. For all I know she could be in some other guy's pants right now. I miss her. I miss how she smelled, how I could always turn to her in times of trouble, because, deep down inside, she held the answers.    I miss my wallet.
2212	True	a	Hi guys, My name is Lani, I'm a teenage girl from LA. I currently go to summer school during the day but because of my families income, it's hard to pay for my school lunch everyday, leaving me hungry. I am fortunate to eat after school and sometimes before but other than that, I have no lunch. If anyone could provide a pizza for one day, I would truly be grateful. Thank you.
2213	False	a	"Eight Hour shift ends tonight at nine. I have a midterm tomorrow and another eight hour shift after. No food in the house. Any time or money I can save would be great. Not the best sob story but worth a try. Thanks  Phoniemcringring  Edit : Leaving work at nine to take a hr bus ride/walk home. Info about me - Student working at my Univ's library. Pay is ok but the shitty thing is that I get a check once a month. Pay day is not til August 8 and the money I have saved is for rent/groceries. Can't afford eating out and  all the stores (that have food) will be closed by the time I get home. ( I live in the ""cuts"" (working class, , lower economic ladder neighborhood; suburban ""firstworldproblem"" type people might call it a ""ghetto"" or a ""hood"" but to me it's great place with cheap rent with great neighbors but a poor ratio of liquor stores to supermarkets or corner stores will actual food)   EDIT : Thanks to everyone who upvoted this. I have received information regarding an ecard to use to get pizza. THANK YOU REDDIT FOR MAKING THIS HAPPEN!"
2214	False	a	would really like a pizza, i am broke and the cupboards are bare, and you can only eat so many ramen noodles... thank you
2215	True	a	Just thinking a random pizza to come back inside to would make everyone's day and I would definitely be able to return the favor to someone else in the future!  In NJ and we'll be working out in the garden and general yard work as well as house cleaning for about 3-4 hours this Sunday morning. If anyone is rad enough for a random act of kindness we all at our household will be forever grateful to your supreme gratitude!   Will also share pictures of the tended to garden! The first Tomato is starting to turn red and my corn is growing taller everyday! 
2216	False	a	Just got my first job at a dry cleaners and I have only eaten a single grilled cheese sandwich all week. Boss doesn't want to pay me for the first week so I'm broke tell next week! As soon as I get my pay check I will buy someone a pizza! PLEASE HELP!  PM me please. I've been browsing reddit for years and I really need some help right now, Thanks!
2217	False	a	[This.](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lvmvg/i_share_a_birthday_with_the_kid_next_door_this/)  I cannot afford to at the moment, but would anyone be willing to PM the OP and offer some help?
2218	False	a	I shall do most anything in reason. I recently moved down here.. In the bumfuck middle of nowhere.  I live a stone's throw away from the Speedway.  I feel disconnected from the world.  I'm ACTUALLY looking forward to the meteor shower tonight-- as there's absolutely no light pollution around where I live.  Maybe enjoy it with a pizza? :)
2219	False	a	Hello, reddit! Long-time lurker, first time poster on reddit!  So at the ripe age of 22, I have finally moved out of my mom's house, and into an apartment with a friend of mine. Rent's been paid, bills are paid, hell, I even just got a job! Unfortunately, all our money has been spent on the aforementioned things, and we're down to rice and ramen in the cupboards until my first paycheck. (She's still trying to find a job). So I came here to petition for a pizza in celebration of our new apartment, new jobs, and hopefully a fresh start!   In return for a pizza, I would be returning a pizza on the day of my first paycheck (The 27th) to whoever is so kind as to get us one tonight. Hell, I'll give one away either way. I am also not above taking funny pictures with the pizza, attempting some sort of art involving the pizza, or pretty much anything else silly that one might request in return for some of that delicious, cheesy-goodness!   Thanks for considering me, and I hope you all have a grand evening!
2220	True	a	I've been having a really difficult time getting on my feet. I was hit by a serious and ongoing neurological problem a couple of months ago, which has made it even harder to find work. I'm all alone in my crappy apartment, my family is hundreds of miles away and so is my girlfriend. I've never tried this before, but it would be great if I could get a big, greasy, sausage mushroom pizza. It's past 12:00 in NY, I wonder if anyone still even delivers...?  This is a really cool subreddit idea, by the way.
2221	False	a	My alarm did not go off before work this afternoon, so I did not have any time to grab a bite to eat before work, and I'm here until midnight. I don't get paid again until Thursday, though, and I just had all my bills due. Pizza would be awesome, will pass it on come Thursday.
2222	False	a	Looking for a generous Redditor to get us a pizza tonight. Wish I could give something back but can only offer pics of our [kittens](http://imgur.com/a/zff2c) Just realized the gray one looks as if it died seconds before taking the picture. Rest assured it's alive and adorable. Thanks.
2223	False	a	Hey RAoP.  I'm waiting for my next paycheck and I'm almost out of money and groceries.  Anyone willing to help me out tonight?
2224	False	a	I'm not entirely sure why, I guess just kindof a sad day. Cheer me up?
2225	False	a	me and my mother have been having issues the last couple months, and normally I hate asking people for assistance, but we have no food, no refridgerator, and just barely a roof over our head, I haven't eaten in about 2 days. investing faith in humanity :)
2226	False	a	Alright, I returned home yesterday -- after spending the previous few days with my boyfriend -- to discover my apartment had been... burglarized (not robbed but burglarized -- police helpfully explained distinction) of the following junk:  - PS3 - PS2 - assortment of games for both - coffee table - my crappy CRT TV  *Thankfully* I'd taken my laptop over to boyfriend's for some LAN partying.  I've never posted to RAoP before, and my account's (very) new, so I apologize for my lack of street cred -- though I've been lurking for months and months. =D  Anyway, reddit, a pizza for me would be like the Holy Grail at this point. I don't... exactly know how this works, but if anyone's willing to help and/or wants any further info, I'll happily happily oblige. Thank you! &lt;3
2227	False	a	Was hoping one of you kind folks would be willing to help out a suddenly-depressed college kid. Just walked out of an Accounting Final that went pretty bad. On top of that, I was supposed to get my check for next term's financial aid this week, but won't be getting it until April 2. Anything at all would be amazing.
2228	False	a	"We're just some pretty hungry straight edge friends looking for some grub. Eating frozen burritos gets old quick.   Thanks!   A horse walks into a bar. The bartender says, ""Why the long penis?"""
2229	True	a	It's a big deal to ask for this, as I'm the first to admit that I am very independent and hate asking for help, but I've got nowhere else to turn.   Story: I'm a freelance theater artist, and I depend upon a steady stream of checks from my various performing and teaching gigs to stay afloat. However, this week two theaters where I teach failed to send my payment, and while I've worked it out to have those missed payments added in a few weeks, I'm currently down to $10 to last me for food for the next two weeks! I am almost out of food at my house, and I've finally accepted that I can't just tough it out with no food for two weeks... so I'm turning to you, the Reddit community, for help!  If you are able to help, I would be extremely grateful! Thank you for reading!   EDIT: I accidentally a sentence. 
2230	False	a	started a new job that's an hour+ away from me (after being unemployed for nearly 4 months). two weeks before my first check. about $6 in my bank account and everything else goes to gas and moving expenses so i don't have to drive so far for this job. maxing out credit card just paying for gas and rental deposit. bah.  i'm tired and hungry and just want a giant pizza and some soda.
2231	False	a	It's been pretty hard this past month food wise, and for the past two weeks I've eaten maybe one meal a day, and the term meal is loosely used. It'd be really nice if someone could bring in the new year on a positive note for me. I'm open for paying back however you choose, or not at all, it's entirely up to your discretion. 
2232	False	a	My unemployment benefits have been exhausted and my interview for food stamps isn't until Tuesday. The only food I have at home is bread and peanut butter that I've been eating all week..I would love a pizza.. I will provide anyone willing with verification of who I am and even screenshots and pictures. I would greatly appreciate any help and thank you in advance! 
2233	False	a	http://m.youtube.com/?reason=8&amp;rdm=3676#/watch?v=V09Mt66O9_c&amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DV09Mt66O9_c
2234	True	a	It's been a hell of a day today.  Woke up late to work, lost my wallet during lunch break, and I came home to no food. Thanks.
2235	True	a	So, I [wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/lsqto/i_would_like_to_take_a_moment_to_rant_about/) a week or so ago about the problems I was having getting the student finance company to get my loan to me, and it still hasn't been resolved and I've reached the end of my overdraft (they'll only give me a ¬£200 overdraft until my loan comes through). I tried to go to my university to get some emergency funds and the lady I spoke to said I could only get a ¬£50 bridging loan which seeing as I'd have to pay back in 4 weeks she didn't want to give me. And after arguing with her for quite a while about how I needed the money to buy food she said that it didn't matter because the lady who could've given me the money left at 2pm (I went in at 1:30pm, she was just arguing with me for that long).   I then went into my bank to try and get my overdraft extended and they told me I needed to do it over the phone, went home and called them up and apparently I needed to go back to my branch and do it. And it would be shut by the time I went in again today....   So could anyone possibly send me a pizza or like... any other food? I haven't eaten all day :( 
2236	True	a	These are the reasons we NEED pizza:  1. One of our roommates is lost in a storm and we would like her to have some melty, tomatoey, cheesy goodness when (if) she survives and makes it back to our dorm. 2. One roommate is banging her head on her desk and if we had a pizza it would be a good cushion so she wouldn't hurt her head. 3. Our toes and fingers are cold and we could use the leftover pizza to warm them. 4. One roommate has an exam and is laughing hysterically. Probably to keep from crying. We think pizza would help. 5. This same roommate just announced that she had to fart. We need pizza aromas to cover up the smell of her toxic waste. 6. Lucy is lost. 7. We can't have our pet unicorn in the dorm, so we think pizza would be the next best thing to have (sloths aren't allowed, either). 8. I just needed to have one more reason so that our list would have an even number of reasons because odd numbers are gross.  Peace and blessins' 
2237	False	a	"I really love the idea of this ""Random Acts of Pizza""  I'm kinda short on cash or else I'd be glad to send out of some pizza love.  I accidentally screwed up my wife's laptop the other day and I'm hoping to surprise her with some kick ass pizza.  Screwed it up soo bad she's making me buy her a brand new one...  and it was an apple macbook...  bla... Anyone from the Kansas City area want to pay it forward?  "
2238	True	a	Help my wife and I celebrate the birth of our first child with a pizza. Wren was born at 6:00 pm on 7/30/11. She weighed 7lbs 12oz and 19.5 inches long. I have used the verification system and have lots of pictures that I need to upload.
2239	False	a	No real sob story, just a lot of revision to do! First post here, can always return and offer when my next loan comes through!
2240	False	a	Just wanted some dinner. I'm in the navy and haven't gotten set up to eat at the galley. Pay day is Friday and I'm broke.
2241	False	a	"I'll write it about whatever you like. I'm a songwriter so you're getting a real, quality song. For the sake of time, I'll write it on an acoustic guitar and record a video. If you want better quality after that; I can record it for you.  I woke up dying for a pizza but it's one of those ""broke 'til payday"" weeks. It'll be much appreciated!"
2242	False	a	I graduated in June from UCLA. I didn't have a job at the time but I had some money and I want to be a screenwriter so I need to live in L.A. So, I set out to find a job. Was not looking for a dream job, just something to pay the bills. Now, here I am three months later and, if a miracle doesn't happen in the next six days, I'm moving back in with my parents. 
2243	False	a	Hey y'all. First post so hoping for the best. Here's the rundown...  I lost my job about a month and a half ago right before my SO's birthday. I was bummed but kind of expecting it (cutbacks and such) and was able to score a few temp jobs here and there to keep my bank account stable, and seeing as my SO still had a full time job, we weren't terribly worried about the situation as a whole.   Fast forward 2 weeks: my SO gets fired out of the blue by the new GM at the newsroom where he worked. He's been really down and has not yet been able to find a job. We had just signed our new lease so all of our money had gone to that and our bills. There is not much I can do for him at this point, seeing as I've only been working 2 or 3 days a week tops.   Normally to cheer ourselves up we go all out on cheap pizza (Dominos, Hungry Howies, etc.), but with our lack of incoming funds, it's something that we haven't been able to do, and I think it would definitely lift his spirit a bit. If any of you wonderful redditors could help, I would be super appreciative. I don't have much of anything to barter with, but I am willing to send you a few pieces of record art that I have made if you would like something in return.   I know this whole thing probably sounds silly, but I need help getting him out of this funk and figure this is a great way to do it. Thanks for any help. 
2244	False	a	I'm living with my ex boyfriend, as he works in a factory third shift and can't take care of the baby but wants to live with her. His brother lives with us because his mom is a dangerous person and has nowhere else to go. He got laid off five months ago, when our baby was born, and because his employer didn't do paperwork, we were only eligable for one month of food stamps.   He went back to work not too long ago, and when our lease was up, we could barely afford a new apartment. I was also just diagnosed with depression, and my medicine is another thing we have to worry about. Our situation is very overwhelming to me, and I don't know how we're going to get through this.   I wouldn't do this if I knew we would be okay, we have doctors appointments that are coming up, medicine to buy, food, rent, bills, tons of other things that are stressing us out, and when I found this, I could breathe a sigh of relief. Please help us have a night where we don't have to worry so much, and I can repay you in cute baby pictures. :)
2245	True	a	[Request] In state of profound shock! My debit card company discontinued their 'overdraft' option which, due to extenuating circumstances, I was counting on being able to use till my next paycheck. Currently have ZERO money for food till next weds. A pizza would hold me over till that date for sure!
2246	True	a	I was laid off in January and have been receiving unemployment since then while trying to find more work, but existing bills wipe out pretty much all of my funds every month aside from basic foodstuffs. My fiancee recently started a plush toy business but it is building slowly and doesn't bring in very much money for us yet. We've been eating variations on beans and rice, potatoes, and stir fry for the last several weeks and frankly we're both really tired of it.  We both tried donating plasma today (there is a company near our house that pays $20 for a first donation), but she's on lithium so couldn't do so and the phlebotomist informed me that I couldn't give because my veins were too narrow. For the first time in months things are looking up--I have three or four good job leads that could be coming to fruition in the next couple of weeks--and we really were hoping to get some pizza as a change of pace.  My fiancee even says she'd be happy to send a plushy as thanks once we've got the money to ship something out--I'd be happy to provide examples of her work via PM if you're interested.  Thanks for looking!  * edit: Should probably add that, while we live in Dallas proper, we live in a very rural part of Dallas and the only major chains nearby that deliver to our area are Pizza Hut and Papa Johns (yes, I know reddit hates Papa Johns).  * edit2: been pizza'd thanks to pineapple_wolf! Woo!
2247	False	a	I lost my debit card this Friday after the bank closed I have had no money all weekend. All I have had to eat this weekend is some bread I had leftover in my pantry :( . Too make matter worse I keep getting 1017d in FFXIV.  Been having a pretty crap weekend, so if anyone wants to make it better that would be awesome. Thanks! Will pay the pizza forward later this week!
2248	False	a	Haven't had pizza in a while
2249	False	a	Been battling substance abuse for sometime, having some of the usual ups and downs. Can't manage to stay clean longer then a few months. Considering heading back to rehab, which is really scary. Boyfriend dumped me two weeks ago, he's dating a girl I thought was my friend, and they apparently have been in love for quite awhile now.   Working two jobs has got me drained...and I really don't want to cook tonight.   Thanks for reading. =]  I live in the southern US.
2250	False	a	I am an education major at West Virginia University. I have very lean means, and frankly, I am starving and would love some pizza. I promise to somehow pay it forward, I just really am hungry right now. 
2251	False	a	This is my first RAOP Request! Thanks, dudes.
2252	False	a	Hey RAoP,  My situation is that I just finished a term in AmeriCorps (http://www.reddit.com/r/americorps) now I'm looking for work and picked up a class to teach at a college, but it doesn't even cover my rent so I'm still looking for a full-time job.  I ran out of food this month because I was sharing my food stamps with another AmeriCorps to tide him over (he's a wiry guy that ate like a horse, and I'm just a wee 120 lb gal that doesn't need that much, so it made sense at the time).  I'm down to 5 packets of ramen, but new funds come in on the 5th so I really just would like to get through this weekend and also feel a bit less depressed while job hunting and lesson planning.  If you could please send me a pizza, it would make my night!  Thank you.  Hopefully someday soon I'll be the one sending out the pizza.
2253	False	a	Pathways Home Base Youth Drop In Centre loves the idea of RAOP and would love to receive a generous gift of some pizza one night for our youth who come to the Centre.  We are helping at-risk and homeless youth regain control of their lives with supportive assistance, life skills, employment assistance and counselling.  Anyone willing to offer a pizza in our area - we would greatly appreciate it.  We are only open Mon - Fri until 8pm.  No sob stories, just want to give someone the opportunity to help us help youth.  I know they would love it.  We never get the chance to offer pizza so this is a great opporunity if someone wants to help out.
2254	False	a	And I'm more than a little nervous right now because I'm doing a lot of job applications, getting a couple interviews for jobs, and really am in a tight spot money-wise, having been out of regular work for nearly ten months. Want to unwind this evening and a sudden urge for pizza goodness crept into my stomach.  ^^I ^^verified ^^via ^^the ^^sidebar.
2255	False	a	TBH, I never knew this was here on Reddit, but imho only, that information came at the perfect time.. 2 years and 16 days ago I was hit from behind on my cycle at a Stop Sign. The ER doctor told me that if I had been wearing a helmet, the force of impact was so great, I would have been killed on the spot. (extra weight (avg 4-6 lbs.) of the helmet would have caused my neck to snap and kill me)  Joining Reddit was one of the many things suggest to me, to help re-train my brain and thought process. To everyone I have talked/debated with, let me take a second here and say Thank You.   But back to the reason for the post, may I kindly ask for a pizza? As it has been a long road back to somewhat normal for me and thinking about someone I don't know, caring enough to say, Hey, let's send this guy a pizza just because, well, it is so damn cool. I'm not sure what happens next, but to the person if they decide to say hey I can do that, please know from the bottom of my heart, I am grateful for your kindness and will pay it forward as I get better and hopefully get back to work. James  
2256	False	a	My friend has helped me with a place to stay and food until I get on my feet and she is having a difficult time herself as a single mother of 1. She didn't need to help me out but after my daughter had open heart surgery I lost everything and after being homeless and hungry for the last 8 months her helping me recently is helping me get my whole life back on track.  She doesn't have much but still is giving and got me out of the homeless shelter!  We do have food so if there's anyone going without please help them.  If there's more to go around we sure could use it and I know her and her son would be very grateful!  Thanks!
2257	True	a	"***************I already posted before but I forgot to put ""request"" in the title. Not scamming.***********  My name is Jonathan. My mother and I receive food stamps in the state of Arizona. We get them on the 7th of every month. Normally they last but this month we had some trouble stretching them out. Today is the 6th and we have no food left in the house and we are just one day away from receiving our food stamps. Enough for one pizza for tonight would be great. That's all we need. We'd appreciate your help. We can give any verification that would be needed."
2258	False	a	(Northern Colorado)  So here's my dilemma guys... My payroll made a mistake on Friday and it was too late to take care of before the next business day (fingers are crossed for tomorrow). The problem is that I literally live paycheck to paycheck a few day late check can really turn your world upside down. I'm starving for a bite to eat tonight and would be so grateful if someone could help me out. After I get my paycheck sorted out I'd be happy to pay it forward or just send a pizza back at you in appreciation. Whatever you want me to do to return the favor, just, please help.  Thanks Redditors,   /u/shaboingdezzleknock
2259	False	a	Would love to have a pie with my fam. Little ceasars is to much. 8 people so a slice a piece would do..wait grandson to small for a full piece. Hopefully thank you
2260	False	a	24, San Francisco. I've been working at my new job for a few months, and it's been up and down for some time. This last paycheck, I had to buy a bunch of furniture for my new apartment, and had scheduled my bills and payments particularly close together, knowing I'd be cutting it close to my next paycheck.  Come tuesday, my debit card was declined for a payment that I knew was coming. I went to check my account and it turns out my gym membership had not been paid, draining my bank account to about 20 dollars.  Adding insult to injury I got sick on thursday, and half of my stuff is at my new apartment.  So here I am sitting alone in a half empty apartment with  no money, sick, broke, and waiting till the 30th to get back on my feet. Any help between now and then would be awesome, and I promise to pay back the ROAP by matching the help given to me.  PM me for details, I have my verification number ready.

2262	False	a	Cash and food supplies are very low right now. We would appreciate some help with a pizza dinner. We will pay it forward when we can. Thanks if you can help.
2263	True	a	Hey,  Just a simple request for a girl going through some tough times. My elderly dog is being put to sleep tomorrow and there is nothing in the fridge tonight, and I'm already broke as it is.  I'm in MN, and I'm willing to provide any other information via PM, including verification if that is necessary. Pizza Hut or Papa Johns would be amazing for tonight, definitely would love something to go right for once, even something simple like this.   You guys are already so wonderful, I will return the favor to another redditor once my bank account isn't hurting so bad.
2264	False	a	My husband left recently for a 6 week military TDY and I'm stuck here alone in this house this week with no way to get anywhere until I leave to visit my family. Our funds are really short, and I'm starting to feel like a crazy cat lady eating soup all day. My cats Friskies is starting to look good.   Pizza would be amazingly appreciated, it solves hunger AND loneliness =] 
2265	False	a	My extremely supportive boyfriend has allowed me to follow my dream, and supports the both of us with his salary. I have a vintage store on Etsy, and within the last year I've found it's truly my passion.  Without a doubt, my boyfriend is one of the most kindhearted and caring people I've ever had the honor of knowing. He gives me support and tells me that my happiness is worth us counting pennies. He allowed me to search for, and find my passion.  We live a life without credit card debt, and choose to pay with things upfront in our daily lives. We pay our bills, but do not have any spending money. We spend every penny simply on our necessities, so much so that we've only been on two real dates in our 10 months of being a couple.   I would really appreciate any kindness to repay him with a warm and toasty pizza! I can easily verify who I am, and would greatly appreciate and kindness from reddit!  Thank you and have a great weekend everyone!  Edit: My location is in Grand Rapids, Michigan 
2266	False	a	This weekend my vehicle took a poop and now its a 1200 dollar repair to get my car fixed. I cant afford that for a whole month and on top of that, I go into work today and they tell me at the end of the month I will be let go from the company because of budget cuts. Single man with a little puppy to feed, got dog food, but a pizza would really bring my spirits up for today.
2267	False	a	Hey, I have money in my paypal and am quite hungry, and have no way to manage this by my self, atleast any time soon. Im hoping someone is willing to trade a 25$ egift card for 25$ thru paypal. Also I live in Alaska (forgot to put it in title)
2268	True	a	Cliffs Notes to my current state of affairs: Squatting in a friends old apartment until the 17th (then onto legit homelessness), interviews almost every day but no job, I have no cash left and I am out of food, I feel terrible for posting this here and expect nothing to come of it, but I am seriously hungry and asking another of my friends for help is just an invitation to resentment in the future.  Is there anyone out there kind enough?
2269	False	a	Not exactly the most exciting offer ever but I'm really hungry and willing to embarrass myself with permanent marker drawings in exchange for a pizza.  I don't have any drawing skills but I will try my hungry heart out for you.
2270	False	a	I will be at the WOW hall booth at the U of O Street Faire from 3:30 PM to 5:00. If you could just give the pizza company your number, I don't have a phone. My name is Andrew aka Rev. Andy, and you can hear me on OPB here: http://www.opb.org/thinkoutloud/shows/ross-brothers/ If possible a Meat Lover's deep dish with garlic and artichokes would be awesome, otherwise anything is cool! I won't be able to check back in after I get offline in a bit here, but please let me know if anyone can help!
2271	True	a	Posting from my phone (contract expires next Wednesday) as we have no wifi. Girlfriend and I met on the Internet, have been in a long-distance relationship (with monthly visits) for ten months. Just moved into a new apartment with her last week. I'm the happiest I've been in a long time, but we are pretty tight on money. I'm job-hunting, she works at a minimum wage fast food restaurant (she brings food back from her job, which is how we eat right now). A pizza or two would be nice if anyone has a few extra bucks lying around. We can handle the delivery guy's tip. Thanks. 
2272	False	a	Hello fellow redditors. I will be very honest, I am one of the people who have come here after seeing the media coverage. Well I have been here before, but mostly just lurking. I haven't been able to afford much for myself lately, so that's why I haven't really participated much here, but it is something I plan on doing once I get some more funds in the bank account.  So here's my story. Tomorrow is one of my really good friends 23rd birthday. It's been a rough year so far for both of us (both had breakups around the same time) and since then, our friendship has really become a lot stronger. I've been in the negatives in my bank account the last two weeks and I can't afford to get him anything for his birthday (it's a byob party and I don't even have any b to b) He's having about 6 or so people over tomorrow to celebrate and I think it would be awesome if we could get some birthday pizza for the party. I know there's a lot of people out there who would better benifit from pizza, but this would mean a whole lot to me if someone could help me out tomorrow evening. I'll pay it forward when I can afford!
2273	False	a	Hi guys. Situation as following: Im gonna get a surgery tomorrow, and 2 days after that get chemotherapy. I want to eat my favourite pizza once more before going to hospital, because the food there is just awful, and I will not be allowed to get any food on my own for like a month(because I got none immune system at all).  I`ve got no money at this moment, and my mum denies to buy me one because she did cook something too. So, I got no big hopes but I`ll give it a try here :D . Proof for the chemo: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/j9qpb/iama_sick_16_years_old_with_myelodysplastic/  Also at this moment im having a Venae Needle in my arm, can take a photo of it and my nick or whatever you wish.(they need it for tomorrow so they can make me sleep before they get access to my heart).  Btw. I doubt anyone is here from germany, so I have paypal also, I would need 8‚Ç¨=~15$ or something.
2274	True	a	Girl has 2 kids, and over $800 was stolen off a debit card. no bueno.   She's a vegitarian!
2275	False	a	I got grounded a few days ago and my dad wont give me my allowance so sadly I can not buy myself some pizza. 
2276	True	a	I'm not uber poor, I don't have a story to share except I'm feeling lazy as hell today.  Would love something I don't have to cook and can't remember the last time we had pizza that wasn't frozen. Any offers appreciated but if you want to give to someone else no hard feelings.   [Here's an album of kitten just b/c.](http://imgur.com/a/uErXU)  EDIT: Forgot to add, I'm in California.
2277	False	a	So I told my brothers that you can get free pizza through the internet. They dont believe me. On top of this, they said that if I come up with this free pizza they will hook me up with one of their friends. I REALLY need this.

2279	False	a	EDIT: Pizza has been received. I will post pictures as soon as I stuff my face.  
2280	False	a	No long sad backstory, just me and my friend, no money, and a realllly craving some pizza, so help out, next time i'll fulfill someone else's pizza request.
2281	False	a	Im studying for my last batch of finals before applying to college in the fall (transfer student, community college path). very hungry but being broke and having no calc textbook I'm really pressed for time :(
2282	False	a	It'll be another couple of weeks until my boyfriend gets his paycheck from his new job, and my income isn't really able to support two people so we've eaten a lot of rice and ramen lately. I've been craving pizza so bad that I've finally gotten the nerve to ask you fine folks to help a girl out (which makes me feel slightly less guilty than asking my parents for $20).   I will definitely pay you back, or pay it forward if you prefer (probably both) as soon as I am able.  (Pontiac, MI)  
2283	True	a	Hey guys, I just got back from the vet after my kitten had an accident, poor guy broke his paw. I don't earn much and scrap by every week with my food budget and the veterinarian bill really set me back this week. If someone here could help me out it would really put my mind at ease. Thanks for reading, here's a pic of the little [guy](http://imgur.com/nzE6x)  Made a thank you thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/vet5r/thanks_the_jury_is_out_for_being_an_awesome_person/) :)

I would be really grateful if someone could provide a bit of food for me today,  the last time i was able to get anything was around friday(around lunchtime) any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

2288	False	a	Dad went on a business trip and left us with twenty dollars for the week along with some food. We have ran out of both the night before and we are hungry. Any help would be appreciated.
2289	True	a	My roommate and I are both recently unemployed, and could use some pizza for subsistence as well as a pick-me-up. We're in south Alabama.  Thank you!
2290	False	a	First things first, this is a sock puppet account.  Second things second, I do have a reputable **real** account and I will talk to you on that account if you private message me first on this one. I'm the creator/mod of a top 50 most active subreddit (according to [subredditfinder](http://subredditfinder.com/)). It's also in the top 100 in most subscribed, fastest rising, and other categories. The reason why I even mention this is so you know I'm a real redditor and not some random outsider trying to exploit your generosity. I'm not using my real account name for reasons I will thoroughly explain if you IM me. Even if you don't plan on helping me.  Finally, what I **can** explain here in the open is this: I've lost 15lbs in ~1 week due to not eating. I've lost my appetite because of a major life crisis, but now as I'm trying to get back into the swing of things I need to be strong but severe loss of financial stability (i think the technical term is being broke as fuck) means that I'm starting to break down physically, and that will jeopardize my ability to get back on track with my life.  I would actually prefer groceries (maybe milk, bread, or eggs), but I know thre is no Random_Acts_of_Balanced_Nutrition out there. I don't even know if I can get food stamps by now, and even if I can it might be too late. Either way, I would appreciate pizza just as much.  Anyways, I realize that I am rambling, but I'd be more than glad to explain my full situation to anyone that cares. I just don't want to make this post searchable by a particular person for reasons I will explain.  If this sounds shady, I completely understand. But again, I will be more than glad to give full details in PM; info which can easily be verified.  Just don't contact me with a sockpuppet account. I don't want some troll to go and fuck me over with the sensitive info I give them. We can talk 1-on-1 with our legit accounts.
2291	False	a	just having hard times, really want a cheese pizza.
2292	False	a	I am not from Prague - staying here for 2 days only. The paper deadline is in 4 hours so probably I will spend some more time working on my results. In the name of high quality research, if somebody could get me pizza (and coffee) please I would really appreciate it. ***spoiler:will reveal the title of the paper to the person offering pizza ;-) Thanks in advance!
2293	False	a	Hey redditors, I'm a starving artist and shooting a short film on Sunday, February 3rd with a bunch of other local starving artists.  There will be about 20 hungry people in a cold and drafty warehouse building in Bristol, PA.  We've got a thank you or provided by credit available to anyone willing to share a slice.  Thanks!
2294	True	a	"You know the song, Dean Martin, ""When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's Amore!""  Well RAOP, I come to you with a humble request.  My girlfriend took me out for Chinese the other night, after I insisted that I eat nothing, because of not being able to pay/pay her back, she ordered her meal, then what she knows I like because, well, she's awesome.  I would like to be able to share a pizza with her this week, to A. Demonstrate how amazing this subreddit is, and B. To respond, in kind, to her generous gift to me.   I am not in dire need. This is a request that is desire-based. I have enough Rice and Ramen to last me for quite some time. So if there are other needs that supersede mine, no worries, I encourage you to use your discretion and give to those who, based on your own criteria, would appreciate it most.   Other than that, I will pledge that for every dollar of pizza I receive via this subreddit, I will, within a month, pay it forward two-fold. So know that your gift of one pizza, will become a gift of two pizzas for others very soon. (As soon as I get a second job, to which I am actually leaving for an interview now.)"
2295	False	a	Hi there.  I was hoping that maybe someone would be willing to donate a pizza to my SO and I.  My mother has our baby for the night and I would love to relax with some pizza and video games, but I don't get paid until Friday, and our kitchen is starting to look rather bare.  You can believe I will definitely be passing this forward when I get paid.
2296	False	a	So I'm in NYC from Boston and I tried to use my card to buy a train ticket so I can get to my friends apt. He won't be home until tomorrow. My card was denied and when I checked my account it turns out I'm in the red because loans and bills came through. I get payed Wednesday(direct deposit) but I'm just looking for a meal to survive tonight and tomorrow. I haven't eaten since lunch yesterday please help!  And in case anyone is wondering Times Square is lovely right now. Still amazed that I'm here. It's my first time!
2297	False	a	~~Hi you guys. First I would like to say this thread and the people who frequent it are amazing. I've always been nervous to post here as I am usually too broke to reciprocate. I'm still broke, but when I get my tax return I definitely will reciprocate.~~  ~~A little about me and why I'm posting: I live with my mom and work a minimum wage job in Southern California. (North County)~~  ~~We have a three bedroom house that the bank is trying to foreclose on. Although this isn't a new situation for us, the guy who offered to do the home loan modification took two-thousand dollars of my and my mother's money and bailed. My mom's transmission also failed around last month so we've been taking the bus.~~  ~~We have been able to manage lately, until recently when my sister and her husband declared they would not be paying my mom rent for staying here anymore, and I found out they had only been paying my mom seventy-five dollars each for the past four months. It has been a pretty big blow, albiet not surprising, and has now put an even greater strain on my mom and I.~~  ~~As of yesterday SDGE came through and shut off our electricity. (I am writing via phone.) The bill is just over six-hundred dollars past due (I just found out) and my mom has been calling around trying to find help. I know it is probably stupid to request a pizza in lieu of everything else but I thought it would be a nice change from everything else going on right now.~~  ~~I know sob stories are probably cliche here, and my apologies for that. Just figured I would give it a shot. If anyone is interested, I can also provide pictures of the SDGE notice on the meter, or whatever else.~~  ~~So yeah. That's it. Thanks.~~  Edit: Overdrew the bank account to get the electricity back on, as it was needed for my mom. I downvoted my post, but just struck-out what I wrote so not to just simply delete as this board has advised against that.   *Mods can remove this if they want.*

Never asked here, so I'm not sure if I'm doing this wrong..but coming out of all that terrible pain and being able to enjoy some pizza would be rad!  Thanks, Jess
2302	False	a	I currently don't have a vehicle and it doesn't look very good in the near future. I hitch rides to and from work while trying to save money. I'm saving everywhere that I can. If I get a free pizza, that will provide a couple of meals for us, saving more money for a car.
2303	True	a	Hi, I am requesting some help. I will not starve or anything, but I am getting by on cereal and enough bread for maybe two more sandwiches until unemployment comes through (hopefully) early in the week. I will pay it forward as soon as I get my unemployment.  Thank you so much. Even if you do not choose me thank you just for caring. -Jack

2308	False	a	We're both poor college students at Purdue, in West Lafayette, IN, and need a break from studying if some beautiful soul is kind enough. I should note that this is my first time using this, and once summer aid comes, I'm going to happily give pizzas in kind. Thanks guys!

2311	False	a	I live in Goodyear, AZ.  I can receive pizza at an address nearby, however i got kicked out by my boyfriend today because we had a huge argument, sadly, he is the one that makes the money, i am a stay at home mom, he is watching 2 kids right now, i miss them and i want to go home, kind of desperate for pizza :) hopefully i get my wish :).
2312	False	a	Going through a pretty rough time right now, (check out my post history if you would like its a long story). And my 3 year old has been asking for pizza for about a week now. If someone could help him out I would be really grateful. Any pizza place would be great we aren't picky.

2314	True	a	Hey all, just want to tell someone about my breakthrough. I had a drinking problem for a long time and decided to do something about it. Today I had my first meeting and it really helped talking about it. I'm kind of in a bad place right now financially and quitting the booze is the best thing right now. If anyone could help out with some pizza I would really appreciate helping me take my mind off the booze and money problem. Thanks all.  Thanks to Gary for helping me through this tough time. It really made my day brighter. http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/uizl6/thanks_garyj73167_for_being_an_awesome_guy_and/

2316	False	a	So yeah, poor kid just trying to get some food, no sob story here. And there is food at home, but it's just sweet stuff, like doritos and oreos. Well maybe there is a sob story. My ex gf left me after two years, and i've been trying to cope with this, but wasted all my money on liquor, and a massage(lol) after finding out she is seeing someone else already .. after two weeks. If anything would like to help, I appreciate it, i'm from New York City. I'll do anything. I just lurk btw, trees, leagueoflegends and depression.
2317	True	a	"For quite a while now, I have been nonstop hard at work on an interactive multimedia project called [[6x]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmCqEP2v_Wo) - a double-disc immersive experience with hours of puzzles, ""flash films"", trip-tools, hallucinogenic visuals, and TONS of hidden features.  Caught between a surreal nightmare and warped mindtrip, this DVD package presents an immersive journey through hypnagogic insomnia in which the viewer is in full control.  Composed from hundreds of sources of bygone media - deconstructed, distorted, glitched and reassimilated into a mind-bending menagerie of disturbing and psychedelic ventures into the user's psyche.  Think of it like a interactive-video-game/experimental-art-film double-DVD set, with a heavy emphasis on the experimental and interactive.  *Note: Contains disturbing and/or adult material. Intended for mature audiences only.*   The project is currently in the autumn stage of development and production (about 70% complete) and slated for release [here](http://0011011001111000.bandcamp.com/) on August 20th, 2013.  Previews available [here](https://www.youtube.com/0011011001111000) and [here](http://0011011001111000.tumblr.com/), though it's difficult to convey the interactive aspect of the project in pictures and videos.  **So here's the thing:** I'm broke right now and pretty hungry, but I do have the DVD package to offer in exchange.  The only hitch is - it won't be released until August 20th.  So if any redditors are interested in the DVD or hooking a hungry brother up with some pizza, comment here!  **EDIT: Feel free to ask any questions about the project as well, I understand it's kind of hard to describe.**"
2318	True	a	My husband was recently reassigned to a new unit (he's a soldier) and he wasn't sure if he was going to be able to take time off for our already booked trip to Vegas. We just celebrated our 9yr. anniversary last week, and this was going to be our first vacation together. I know it's frivolous, but he just got word that his leave was approved and I was hoping to celebrate with some sort of dinner out. Our problem is that payday isn't until the first so we're broke. I know that's a really long story for a simple question, but there it is.   Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this :)
2319	False	a	I (Rachel) and my friends (Liz and Dylan) do not get paid for multiple days and are pretty much subsisting off of PB&amp;J, noodles with butter, and the last little bit of a bottle of tequila. It is nice tequila though. My point is, we are hungry and broke until further notice and we would love nothing more than a pizza at this very moment. Help a sister out and we'll hit you back, pay it forward, either or both. Much obliged   :)
2320	True	a	Is anyone willing to help me out while I make an expensive move to a new place? I would pay it forward.  UPDATE: Aaaahhh random pizza tastes great! I got a random sandwich and Coke thrown in. Thanks so much to jonnyamsterdam for the RAOP! I'm saving the leftovers for dinner!
2321	False	a	I'm a college student and I would love to get a random act of pizza. I forgot that the dinner hall closes early on Saturday, so I missed dinner. I only have $3 with me and my roommate is out doing a project, so I can't get her to help me. I have no food in my fridge and the only food I have with me is chocolate and popcorn. 
2322	False	a	I'm quitting my job in IT to focus on my last semester of college and a career in music management, which is what I've been going to school for. Since I'll just be doing internships next semester, I really need to save my money. And of course I leave my lunch at home today.   I just discovered this subreddit last week and will definitely pay it forward as soon as I have some spare cash. Thanks and have a good weekend!
2323	True	a	My boyfriend and i both lost our jobs within a week of eachother.  All money we have been able to make goes towards rent.   Is there anyway someone on reddit can help us? Even just someting small will be great!
2324	True	a	Title says it. I'm bummed. I'm in the midst of an internship with disney (you would think I'd make money to live on). I had a seizure the other week so I've been out of work for awhile, my roommates have been awful, I've been dealing with security all day and I would love to just relax with a pizza and a movie and chill. I can't afford my own pizza right now. Bummer.   So does someone want to make my night? 
2325	True	a	It would make a great birthday gift, thanks in advance.
2326	False	a	I fell in love with a girl, a seemingly amazing girl, who I was ready to grow old with‚Äîfor better or worse and everything in between. I'd been hurt before, but I gave her more and more of my trust and grew to love her enough to commit myself to her for life. I had taken her across the country to make sure she could meet all of my family, especially my grandparents while they're still alive. Everything was going great until... well.... She broke up with me rather suddenly. The reasons she gives make it seem like she's hiding something from me. We never had any real problems. The fact is, I hardly feel like getting out of bed in the morning. I still go to work to pay my bills, but I don't really have any friends in my town anymore, and my family lives far away. My roommate is pretty much all I have left around here. Everything around here reminds me of times that I spent with my beloved, but it's all been shattered.  I feel completely devastated. She was my life. I'd love to feel a little bit of the love that you good folks are spreading around if you could share it. I'll get a verification code as necessary. Thank you kindly, fellow Redditors.

2328	True	a	Hi ROAP! I am going through a rough time right now. My fiance left me recently and going from a two income household to one hasn't been easy. Especially with debt from some credit cards and loans in my name that were used to benefit the both of us. I will be honest I am not starving to death, but I am really upset and it would really cheer me up to have something with flavor to eat. ( I have been eating mostly oats, rice, and beans ) I am willing to use the verifaction system to check my ip and email to prove I am not a scammer. Thanks!
2329	False	a	Yeah as the title says I'm in a pretty bad spot and on top of these things I'm hungry! I'll be sure to pay it forward once I'm in a better situation!!   and it looks like I posted this to the wrong subreddit, so now I'm reposting here :)  edit: Oh also, I'm near NYC

New appartment, so no food i know how to cook, and she is still waitin on a transfer to the local kroger so we've been short her check for two weeks.  I figure someone out in the houston area that enjoy's their beer wouldn't mind helping out a hungry guy who spent all day filling up shelves with budweiser to keep all you drunks out there happy :)  *EDIT* Pizza recieved courtesy of http://www.reddit.com/user/ninjaliwa in his offer thread, in which he was generous enough to send some to several people, so many thanks to him from everyone it looks like he ended up sending pizza to
2333	True	a	This is my first time requesting, I'm a full-time nursing student only able to work part-time. I'm not going to make this a sob story, I get paid tomorrow, but all I have left to eat tonight is some chili so I would really appreciate a pizza! I love RAoP and hope to contribute very soon as well =)
2334	False	a	We have an abundance of beer and we have starcraft but we dont have pizza so if we continue to drink at this rate we will surely pass out and stop playing starcraft, if we get pizza we will be able to continue playing starcraft :) 
2335	False	a	Dear /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza  I come before you now as a humble man. I would like to think I am an honest man so I shall tell you an honest tale.   My name is Dave and I currently am working at a Homeless shelter for homeless youth in Seattle called ROOTS. I love working at ROOTS, I can sleep easily in the mornings (since I work throughout the nights) knowing that I am helping keeping 30 homeless youth off the streets and away from SNOWzilla's wrath as he stomps through Seattle.   SNOWzilla has ruined things here in Seattle. Because of the nature of the place I work at, someone MUST be on staff every night, and I have to work throughout the weekend and since the buses are closed? I must walk 5 miles in ice and snow to get to work.   Sadly though, I don't get paid very much. [(Bank Statement)](http://imgur.com/DvEeh) But that is the way of the world working for a homeless shelter. I haven't eaten in the last day and a half because of there being nothing in my kitchen [My fridge](http://imgur.com/05ffR) and stores being closed.  So I am asking you all, if you are willing, would be able to show a snowed-in man with no money some kindness? Even under these difficult times, and even if whether or not my ask for some kindness has no results, know that I have fun even when times are grim [I did it all for you, Reddit!](http://imgur.com/bhnxu)  I hope you can all find it in your hearts to give some kindness my way. I hope you all have a SAFE time as snowzilla causes havoc in everyone's regions and I live you with one last picture.  [Will you be my angel tonight??](http://imgur.com/vBBNm)
2336	True	a	Don't get direct deposit from my job till past the delivery man's bedtime... just ate me a chicken pot pie and oatmeal because that's all I got left... very end of the month sure is fun, ain't it? I work my butt off and thus, come home and raid the hell out of my fridge... but at the end of this month I'm pretty much foodless till tomorrow. I would love me a pizza right now, so if you please, buy me a pizza, pepperoni will be fine, and I'll buy you two tomorrow when I actually have money. The only thing I love more than charity is rewarding charity. Thank you.
2337	False	a	i am giving this a try because i have not had pizza in about 4 months and im really missing the taste of it and basically i would really like a pizza i will be posting offers in the future 
2338	False	a	So..  without giving you my whole life story here goes -   I have been having health issues that have been progressively worse over the last few years.  (I am getting tested for carcinoma this week)  My girlfriend not only has stayed with me but provides me with everything I need, including expensive pre-existing condition insurance which she had to move across the country for me to have.  I keep trying to work from home and sell my stuff on ebay etc. but I never will equal the amount that she gives without any hesitation.  I have not been able to take this girl out for dinner in 3 years and she works full time.  It would make my lifetime to be able to surprise her with pizza that was acquired by me.  *as a caveat my illness causes me to not be able to eat, consequently I am not excited about food much less cooking it and not eating it so this would save me from that too for a night :)   http://instagram.com/p/UDEVvJGFY9/   edit:  Heres our rescue Ruby.  I'll show you gretchen (mah kitty) of anyone cares
2339	False	a	College student with a fixed income here. Payed the utilities, bought gas, and now have nothing left till friday payday but a couple dollars. I've eaten enough Ramen and Chef Boyardee to last a lifetime, I would love a delicious pizza.  I've given before,  http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPizza/comments/jrcoj/thank_you_theunrepentlurker/  and will do so again when I have the money, right now I just really want a hot meal that doesn't tasted like crunchy salt...  Thanks   
2340	False	a	I have been going on a downward cycle lately. I've recently lost my mother to cancer. Without me knowing about the loan my mother had taken out a few years ago, my family ended up losing our store. My grandparents put everything they had into that store and it makes me sick to know that it's gone. Depression has kept me away from many things and this includes the day to day business and just knowing how far in the red we were.  I have tried very hard to be a contributing member of society, but after 6 months of no work I am quickly losing hope. The one thing I have wanted for so long involves a tall glass of soda and a thick slice of pepperoni pizza. No matter how I dress up these minute noodles, the taste cannot compare to a delicious slice of pizza. I'm hoping some kind soul out there would be nice enough to treat me to some pizza please. I don't know exactly how this works, but I've been reading and I'm intrigued. Some pizza could definitely cheer me up. Thank you.
2341	False	a	It is a dreadful rainy day in Chico, and I have no current means of dry transportation. A hurricane of an empty stomach is howling at me, and the only cure I can think of is some tasty Dominos delivery. Please help me out, and someday in the future I shall return the favor to another in need of tasty round goodness.
2342	False	a	I have an O-Chem midterm in about 3.5 hours (2:15 Pacific) I have $1.80 in my account [http://i.imgur.com/qo6Oo.jpg&lt;====(proof here) ] and all this studying is making me hungry.  (will share with other lucky students in the Chem tutor room)  Edit: Located in Santa Barbara, CA. Here---&gt; http://g.co/maps/xvqg4, on campus. 
2343	False	a	My girlfriend and I have been dating for six months today and I was being the guy I am and didn't get a gift. It turns out that she had gotten me a gift and I didn't get her one, even though we agreed on no gifts. So if anyone could help me out, that would be amazing. I promise to pay it forward when I get paid next week.
2344	False	a	I used to work in one but recently was laid off after we went bankrupt &lt;/3 Haven't had one of their slices in awhile and I would LOVE to get some good luck today!  Please and Thank you!
2345	False	a	I'm broke again, fridge empty. Did not have enough money after bills and such to do any food shopping. I only have my carfare to and from work on a metrocard. I would appreciate a pizza, please and thanks a million. :)
2346	False	a	My wife and kids, and mother in law left this morning to Washington state to visit her family she hasn't seen in about 20 years.. We saved up for airfare and money to spend while they were there.. I just got a new job about 2 moths ago. We were drowning in debt but with this job, are afloat again. well, we bought me groceries for my stay at home this week (ramen, easy mac, hambuger helper) so she could have as much money that was left for them ($300) to spend while they were there. All i would like is a half meat lovers half pepperoni and jalapeno on thin crust from pizza hut. i have no $ to spend until i get paid next week on the 20th. If you can help out, thank you. If not, help someone more needy. Ya'll have a good one.
2347	False	a	hi im a 45 yr disabled mom and grandma living on my ssi check , i do not get my fs til the 4th of october my check goes completely to bills any help with  a pizza request would be so appreciated im new on here ,we are a family of  3 adults and a teenager and am 8 yr.old  im in lowell massachusetts
2348	True	a	"EDIT: I have been offered pizza for my family, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!  I'm really not sure how to do this, I've been lurking for awhile and signed up last night and my email is verified.  My husband started a new job at the beginning of last month, they pretty much promised the ""world"" to get him in the door. This hasn't happened, instead it's brought us further to the bottom. We made a whole $500 last month and it's not better this month either. He's talking about getting a lawyer because, he hasn't been paid for everything he's done and paid way less than promised. No, we didn't get anything in writing and that is one piece of evidence we don't have for a lawyer.  I applied for foodstamps on the 23rd of last month. They said they would be expedited but, then said (today on the phone) that since we did have that money last month then they have until after the 20th of this month to finish my case. They said they are unsure of the info on the wage form from his employer. Well, I haven't seen it since they faxed it to eachother and my worker is out until Monday. I spoke to a supervisor and didn't really get any words in.  Anyways, our bills are not all paid so the $212 (Yes, that was his pay deposited in the bank!) today had to go towards the bills. My husband is a truck driver and I'm applying for financial aid to go back to college.  We are a family of 4 and would love to request pizza for tonight. Yes, I know that I am new. I cannot offer contribution of funds, gift cards or whatever but, I can offer things locally and posted an offer of a full garbage bag of clothing/shoes for a little girl in the assistance section. We are behind on our internet/phone so it will be shut off soon, that is why we still have internet access or else I'd have to use the library in town.  I'm unsure of how this works, please bare with me. We are rural, they don't deliver out here. There is a Pizza hut, Dominos and a Hunts brothers in a local country diner.  I want to make sure everyone knows that my kids will NOT starve tonight if they don't get pizza. We have a few odds and ends and I would never, ever let them starve. I'd find a way to get them food before letting that happen. I'll also be visiting the pantry for the 1st time on Tuesday.  I'm not sure what kind of proof I could give? His checks are direct deposited with no stubs mailed yet. Let me know what I need, I can try to figure out something to prove if requred."
2349	False	a	Hey, I dont really want to cry with a sob story but I'm really hungry and i cant afford anything! A pizza would be a welcome treat for me and my dog!   Thanks :)
2350	False	a	I used to be on social security but they cut me off and I'm in a phase of transition from codependency to job status and can't afford dinner tonight. It would be amazing if someone could hit me up with a meal.  I can draw animals and stuff, I'll totally draw art for pizza.  Please and thank you?
2351	True	a	I'll do anything for pizza, a dare, sing a song, whatever you like. No NSFW stuff though obviously. 
2352	False	a	Yesterday, I helped a fellow redditor out by finding a video he's been searching for in return for some pizza. [Link to thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/19u7rr/i_will_order_you_pizza_for_the_right_song/)    However, since he's in another country, his credit card couldn't go through, and he was unable to place an order online. So he sent me $24 through Paypal. :)  I've been in a sort of a rough patch, and haven't had a decent meal in weeks. So I was really looking forward to having pizza for dinner on a Saturday night. Unfortunately, I found out Papa John's and Pizza Hut don't accept Paypal.   Now I'm not sure if I'd be breaking any rules by doing this. If I am, please let me know and I'll take this down. If not, then I would be more than happy to send someone $24 through Paypal if they could order some pizza for me.   Proof of Paypal funds: http://i.imgur.com/7zPm5rt.png
2353	False	a	Hey, reddit! I just discovered this subreddit, and think it is amazing.   I'm hanging out with friends from college that I don't see much and think this sub is amazing. I live near a dominos and a pizza hut, they're both relatively cheap. There's also a little Caesars which is very cheap I think like 5 dollars for a pizza.   I wouldn't ask for a RAOP if we weren't all completely broke.  I have 40 dollars until 2 fridays from now, but a pizza for me and my friends would be amazing. Plus, an awesome story to share and might make my friends give reddit a shot! :)    **If not, thanks for reading and have a great day fellow redditors! :)**  EDIT: Also, would definitely be willing to pay it forward once I find a second job :) 
2354	False	a	Not in any circumstances where i need food just a college student in NE Iowa with a craving for some pizza because of my cafeterias weak attempts to make it.
2355	False	a	Would be a huge lifesaver tonight......
2356	False	a	I've had a difficult time dealing with this disease and being that I have no health insurance, it has left me pretty broke. I'm living off of ramen noodles at this point and would really like to change it up a bit. Maybe the change will help my mental state a bit?
2357	False	a	(or sooner. Lol) My husband and I (Newly married gay couple May 10th, 2012. (facebook.com/strit9boy).   Would like to make a pizza our Third Wheel.
2358	True	a	hey there- I have a special request. Sunday afternoon I am driving from NH to Baltimore to see a lupus/antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) specialist at John's Hopkins as APS is pretty rare and I have been pretty sick recently and getting worse, not better.   A friend I actually met through a couch surfer I hosted has become like a surrogate dad to me and is flying here from California to drive me down- he is an incredible person and I owe him my life. He does so much for me and has agreed to drop everything to make sure I get the care I need to get well.   Anyhow, he is paying for everything for this trip- including the visit if I can't get any financial aid help (have submitted an application) as I don't have insurance. I can't tell you how blessed I am to have this man in my life.   Other than gratitude I have nothing to offer him as I am very broke due to my illness keeping me from working despite trying desperately to get well enough to resume my career.   Can anyone arrange to have a pizza delivered to where we are staying either Sunday night when we are due to arrive or Monday for after my appointment? I think he would appreciate it and I know I would more than words could say!  I am still not sure where we are staying yet or exactly when we are arriving but I can let the giver know the exact details as soon as I know. I am hoping to stay Sunday with a friend from high school in nearby Elkhorn but if not it will be a hotel close to JHMC. Subsequent days will definitely be in a hotel (I will be outpatient, not in patient).   Many thanks for even reading and considering this!
2359	False	a	Pimpin aint easy!   To expand on this, I'm feeling a little down. Some pizza might be able to cheer me up. Unfortunately, my financial situation (broke, college, etc.) wont allow it. I feel a little awkward just begging on here, and im sure this wont work, but I figured why not. =/ Anyway, if for some reason you do feel like helping me out I would be really grateful. 
2360	False	a	I'm out of food, can't afford a car, and not in walkable distance from a pizza place. If anyone helps, I'll post a thank you with proof of pizza, and pass it on. Thanks!
2361	False	a	and my first week off since January (aside from spring break). Between a non-paid internship at a local newspaper, school, freelance work for bills, I find myself sitting here broke gaming on my computer for the first time in ages. The only thing that could make this better, is some pizza from a generous fellow Redditor. Reddit pls. 
2362	False	a	Hungover, penniless, and I found out my gf was cheating on me.  Don't mean to beg, but I could really use a pizza.
2363	True	a	So, I'm unemployed. Haven't gotten enough financial aid. Ineligible for unemployment because I didn't make enough money at my last job. Majorly stressed. And to top it all, I might get evicted because the person I'm subletting from hasn't paid the landlord for 2 months. Once I pay my rent and utilities for this month (both on hold on landlord's orders until they sort out the mess) I'll have about $30 left. Unless I find a job soon or get approved for additional financial aid (my department told me to go screw myself on grants and assistantships), I'm screwed in a serious way. I really could use a pizza though.
2364	False	a	I've had to miss work the last two days, and I can't afford to eat on my $3.47 that's in my bank account. I'm not starving, per se, but a pie would be awesome. 
2365	True	a	Worked at a small software solutions company as a recruiter in HR. The company decided my position should have someone with more experience, and that meant I was no longer qualified for my job (was entry level, became 3+ yrs experience required). To make it worse, I was laid off 1 hour before the company handed out iPads to all the employees as a Christmas gift.  Edit: Atlanta, GA
2366	False	a	My two boys entered first grade and pre-K today and I'd like to get them a special dinner tonight but my wife and I are broke. Anyone willing to save them from Mac &amp; Cheese?
2367	False	a	I preemptively realize that this post is at a severe risk of sounding like a pity party, but I want to make it clear that I am not trying to create a sob story here. But, I also want to be honest. Know that I am happy (pizza or not)! With that disclaimer out of the way, here is sort of what is happening in my life, cliff-note style.  -I am poor in the college-student sort of way. My parents are broke, so I worked my way through college working for AT&amp;T 40 hours a week.  -I did well in college  -Upon graduating, I received a US government grant to move to Taiwan for a year.  -Yay!  -However, there was a six month gap between college and moving to Taiwan, one that was really hard to fill with employment. So, we are pretty broke.  -The last few weeks of my life have been insane. Applying for visas, passports, getting medical clearances, seeing every doctor in town, selling my car, buying a new wardrobe, packing or selling everything I own... you get the idea. My GF and I have been waking up, scrambling all day, and going back to bed. We are exhausted and broke.  -I am leaving to Taiwan in 4 days, and I still have so much to do that it's quite upsetting.  -From what I understand, the pizza situation in Taiwan is quite depressing :(  So, I ask for some help for my GF and I, one last chance to eat some pizza before we move on into the unknown (and one less thing to have to figure out tonight as we continue packing).  I had always read about this sub-reddit, but never participated. I always figured that if I did, I would be giving away a pizza. But, at the moment, it seems life put me in the position of the requester.  Pizza or not, I think this is a really cool subreddit, and I am super excited to be moving abroad, despite all the stress involved with preparing.  Thanks for listening, and I can't wait until I am in a position to be the pizza giver.  EDIT: Sorry, I am in the Atlanta, GA area. I just re-read the info site and noticed I missed this bit. 
2368	True	a	The Dominos doesn't deliver here but Pizza Hut does! I'll also throw in some reddit gold since I can pay for that with google checkout!  Any kind hearted souls out there mind hooking me up?
2369	False	a	I'm just looking for a pizza tonight since it's the one night I worked a day shift instead of closing, and I decided to stay in so that I could get some decent sleep. Thanks!
2370	False	a	Yesterday I took an overnight bus ride to visit a friend before classes started, but since I'm so smart I decided to come over right after paying all my bills, thus leaving me in this spot.  Would any kind guys help me invite my friend to dinner?  Thanks!
2371	False	a	Hello,  Before I ask my question I want to make it clear I am in no way accusing anyone of anything and I am in no position to buy anyone pizza in fact I am probably more in need of a pizza haha...  Anyway, I've noticed that most if not all requests from the UK seem to go unanswered, why is this? Is it not possible to buy pizza for someone in the UK from America? Or would people rather look after their own country men before others...  I'd really love to find a way to help my UK bros get some pizza. Any suggestions? Thank you.  Edit: I would love to get involved with any ideas people have.
2372	False	a	These three dogs are a handful and are making me hungry! Would love a pizza this New Years Eve as my spouse/in-laws are out of town and I'm feeling kinda lonely. Thanks in advance :)
2373	False	a	I have a 5 month old baby boy that is being a stage 5 clinger today so no cooking is getting done. A pizza would be pretty helpful but it's not in the budget. I have a verification code. Thanks! 
2374	False	a	Hey, guys i am at my girlfriends house and i wanna suprise her with a large pie. I would buy it but, currently we are saving up to move to Colorado in two months(so money is tight). Wondering if anyone could help us out?
2375	True	a	Hoping to have an interview soon. However, I'm broke until at least Wednesday hopefully that is. If anyone is kind enough to supply me with pizza I'll certainly give when I can.
2376	False	a	i also started a new job, so after my first paycheck, i can pay it forward, or pizza you back up! thanks for the help guys
2377	False	a	HULK LOVE PIZZA BUT HULK LOSE HIS WALLET WHILE HULKING OUT AT BAR LAST NIGHT. CAN ANYBODY HELP HULK
2378	False	a	My best college buddy Lives in New Zealand but has been sleeping on my sofa in Los Angeles for the last 2 months because he has run out of money.  We want to watch the football games this afternoon but I'm tired of paying for him!  I feel like I have a 30 year old child.  Anyone wanna send us some PIZZZZZAZ?!!?!  CAN HAZ?
2379	False	a	Long time lurker....   So..I'm 21 years old and I've been really struggling to come up with money to eat lately. I've been trying to find jobs as much as I can but I am currently a bit stuck at home because I have gout. It has affected my left foot severely and I cannot exactly leave the house or get out as much as I need to.   Just hoping someone can help me out! I will forward the favor one day!
2380	False	a	"Hey Pizza People! First of all I just want to thank you guys for being so awesome and making this subreddit possible. Once I have money, I plan to be a random-pizza-giver :3  So backstory. Last year (I was 18), I was sexually assaulted by a stranger not too far from Harvard Square. It resulted in some severe PTSD: I couldn't sleep or eat. I was hardly able to function or focus enough to even engage in casual conversation. I couldn't stand to exist in my own mind any longer so I tried to fix it by drinking, which only made me feel sick and more depressed. I tried smoking weed (I'd smoked often before and it seemed to help then) but now the weed gave me flashbacks to the assault and made it so much worse. I was getting desperate. I don't know how the idea got into my head, but one morning I was getting dressed and I just made the decision. It was this voice of deliberate recklessness that announced, ""Today I'm going to try heroin.""  It was alarmingly easy to get my hands on it. It was cheap and it was everything I needed. I knew it was stupid, but I didn't care. I had nothing left to lose - and why stop when it works?  Well eventually I ended up in a psych hospital for the PTSD and heroin addiction. I got help, I got my shit together, and I'm going to college.  So yeah. That's my story. This is me [before and after](http://imgur.com/blBMtWH) getting my shit together.  Thanks for reading this, if you did :) otherwise,  **TL;DR: Bad guy, PTSD, heroin, recovery, can I have pizza now please?**"
2381	False	a	I am sitting here alone and bored this evening. Would be nice to spend it with a pizza. Just imagine the adventures the pizza and I  could go on, and once the adventuring is over the pizza will be devoured. But do not fret as the deed will be repaid to another poor pizza less soul, so they can also enjoy the greatness of the pizza.
2382	False	a	I'm kind of curious to see if someone does respond. I have less that $20 in my bank account, and I'm stuck at work until Midnight. Anything would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!
2383	False	a	Im not broke like many of the others in here, that being said I am on a college student budget and would love a pizza to help pull me through this all nighter I'm starting. Good luck to any other student that sees this!
2384	False	a	Lost my last 5 dollars last night and don't get paid until Friday :(  Just had my last cup o noodles and a Pizza would rock and/or roll! Much appreciated!
2385	False	a	Mishawaka IN College student would love a pizza. I think I'm a decent singer, and I'll sing you any song (within reason, ie, if I know it)
2386	False	a	Well, I do tech support here in Fayetteville, NC. I got sick a couple of weeks ago and had to go to the doc. I don't have insurance yet, so that tapped out my savings, to start. It also got slow at work, which meant I had to leave early several days in a row.  I just barely made rent. I had 5 bucks left to go grocery shopping on. I bought a 10lb bag of rice and some flavorings (pizza sauce, soy sauce, salsa that was on sale) and have been eating that for the last week. At this point, I just want something with some flavor. I get paid on the 20th, and would love to buy a pizza or two then for someone.  Just figured I would ask. It may work, it may not. Never know.
2387	False	a	I'm a full time photography student, and I really don't have money to spare. My brother pre-ordered Skyrim for me and I'd love some pizza for when I play on Friday evening. I know I'm not as down on my luck as some other posters, but I have a pretty good knowledge of photoshop and I'll do my best to fulfill any requests for pizza! 
2388	False	a	I've heard amazing things about this sub, so I figured I'd give it a shot.      &lt;p&gt;   Radiator cracked on me, and so my checking account got completely emptied...This is only weeks after a $2000 repair job on the rest of the engine, and is extremely frustrating. Would love to be able to eat something that isn't ramen or rice.       I'm not sure what sort of info i need to provide, but I guess the closest pizza place is Papa Johns and I'm in South Carolina.         Thanks to anyone to wants to help me out!
2389	False	a	My mom was recently in a car accident, and she's been having shoulder/neck/back problems that she has to get MRI's done for and she has to visit her doctor frequently. My parents usually supply me with some money when they can, but I rejected their offer this time because their $20 copays are piling up and they barely have any food in the cupboards themselves, so they need the money much more than I do. This is my first post on here, and I realize there may be people that need food much more than I do, so please help them first. Pizza would last me a few days. God bless. 
2390	False	a	I am a postgrad whose adviser just told me my thesis project needs to be completely changed. Could you please send me a pizza to cheer me up?
2391	True	a	Finally got a job but the way the first pay works I am without for another week. If someone could help me out that would be amazing.
2392	False	a	I lost my job, I am not begging, but I will not lie, Pizza would be a good cheer-er up-er :)
2393	False	a	I'm just your avrage poor high schooler pulling an all night study sesh, will happily pay you back this friday when i get paid, the pizza's half priced too because i work there! Thank you so much for your time!
2394	False	a	We're having some financial issues, and we'd rather any extra money go towards the baby, but man, we are dying for a good pie. 
2395	True	a	[Request] Out of Saint Louis Missouri. (Specifically The Soulard Area)  So here is my story, Hopefully it will warrant delicious pizza..  For the past 5 months i have been an addict in recovery. At one point i realized i no longer wanted to keep living the way i was living.. Talked to my family and got help. I was addicted to Amphetamines and was starting to develop a bad heroin habit. I spend 42 days in rehab.. Came out with a new lease on life, and spent the next 3 - 4 months in a sober living facility. Just trying to remember how to live and enjoy life sober.. I got the best job i have ever had (Contracting for charter) and after a month i was promoted to be the south Saint Louis Market contractor. (Basically i managed all southern saint Louis contractors) Things were going great, With my new job i rented out a new apartment Set myself up a home office, and genuinely enjoyed day to day activities. Then one day, When i was heading back from a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, I got pulled over in Illinois (15 minutes from my apartment in Saint Louis) The Police Officer Informed me that i had an outstanding warrant in O-Fallon Missouri for Possession of a controlled substance. You see, I knew that this warrant was a possibility, But i had assumed they would let me know when they decided to issue the warrant! 6 months prior (Before Rehab) i had been arrested for Possesion and they had let me go, With no ticket, Not even a court date. Since that was my first serious charge ever i had assumed they would at least let me know if i had a warrant. Well. Long story short(er) I ended up spending 5 days in a holding cell in collinsville Illinois, 2 Days in Madison County, and 1 day in St Charles County. MY mother had got me a lawyer so that i could bond out (they didn't want to let me post 10% so without a lawyer my bond would have been 20,000) and ended up spending 5k just so i can hopefully keep my job.  She had hoped that by getting a lawyer and since this was my first offence, ever, We would be able to preserve my job. Well, No luck. I lost my job because of my 1 week absence and the fact that i had obtained a felony. Since i was a contractor i cannot collect unemployment.  So here i am. 1 month later. With barely Any food in my fridge, A carton of cigarettes, and an internet connection that will be shut off any day now. I have until the 30th of august before i get evicted, and am currently considering moving back into a half-way house. BUT i am STILL SOBER! Which i am proud of, Months ago i would have been wasted the second anything went wrong. So i come to you, knights of pizza, humbly asking to Make my evening tonight. I would LOVE to eat something other than macaroni and cheese.  I can prove any of it! i can provide pictures of: Graduation certificates, An empty fridge, a hungry dog, anything you can think of.. Thanks in advance.  TLDR; Living Life Like a boss, then old warrant came up, Lost everything because of bad decisions in the past.. pizza will help morale.
2396	False	a	Been pretty hungry lately, it's hard to find a job since I have no prior experience so I have no regular source of income. My college gives out refund checks but not until August 2nd. Could really go for a pizza or hell even just some breadsticks I don't really care. If you need any other reason, my 21st birthday is August 10th, and also I live in Ohio. That should be the biggest reason, this place blows. Any thing would be appreciated! 
2397	False	a	I am really down in the dumps and a hot, steaming pizza would make me very happy. I'm really cold and tingling, nothing could fill me up better. Thank you so much for your consideration  Milpitas, California
2398	False	a	I am starting to see a trend of some of these new accounts try and play the 'I am a cute female on the internet' card. I sit here contemplating sending someone a pizza, but notice more and more potential manipulation and then change my mind.  This is random acts of pizza, and honestly the person who gets a pizza from me is not going to be someone trying to get some free stuff this way.
2399	True	a	My suit's pressed, I've spent the last two days researching and memorizing everything I can about the place, I even googled tips for acing an interview. I'm really pumped and I think I'm ready to nail this... the only problem is that I haven't eaten in three days, and I haven't had a good meal for longer than that. My arms are shaking, I can hardly walk without my heart beating furiously, and I just noticed that my voice shakes as well. If I show up to an interview like this I' afraid they'll think I'm a crackhead (I'm pretty skinny). The last substantial thing I ate was a sample of a sandwich from Jimmy Johns, (I asked for three and gave the other two to the homeless people I'd passed a block before) that was on Wednesday.  I just need some sustenance, whether it be a pizza, sammich... shoo I'd be excited about a bag of breadsticks.  If anyone is gracious enough to help me out, I promise to return the favor and help people out on RAOP as soon as financially possible.  Thanks for your time!
2400	True	a	I live in Baltimore, Maryland very close to a Papa Johns Pizza place. I've been unemployed for over 2 years, struggling to make ends meet. I am loaded with $10,000+ medical bills which I cannot pay because I don't have a job (been struggling trying to find a job, the job environment is pretty crappy here in Baltimore) and many have already been submitted to collections. I've fallen on pretty hard times and I'm hoping there's at least one Redditor on here who is generous enough to give me a Papa Johns eGift Card from here: http://www.papajohns.com/papacard/ so I can have something to eat for today.
2401	False	a	I just got my wisdom teeth taken out, and thanks to the drugs, bleeding, and swollen cheeks, I pretty much can't do anything except stay inside or sleep. I can't even watch TV or be on the computer that much, because my head hurts if I stare at the screen too much. I'm constantly bombarded with pictures of good food (unhealthy food) on Facebook, Twitter, and of course Reddit, and I would love to have a pizza to celebrate my healing process (whenever that might be). I don't have a sob story to tell, but I'm low on cash and have to pay my credit card off soon anyways. Any sort of pizza flavored goodness would be appreciated.   If you want, I could write you a poem, send you a photo of something (within reason, I'm not talking gonewild material here), record some guitar playing, or something like that. Just let me know, I'm not doing much with my time anyways.
2402	True	a	We are completely out of food and have no way of getting anything or any money at the moment and all I have to offer is an Olive Garden gift card. It has $25 on it and I will never use it as we don't live close to one. If anyone can help us out, I will gladly send you my card and I will even send you the info or a picture so you can check the balance on it yourself :) We live right next to Domino's so a ecard for them would be absolutely perfect as we can walk right there and pick it up.   Proof: http://s232.photobucket.com/albums/ee163/marcileigh88/?action=view&amp;current=DSCN0125.jpg  **Edit** A friend helped us out tonight.
2403	False	a	I've never posted here before, but I'll gladly pay it forward when I get the chance. Most major pizza places are within delivery or driving distance from where I live. Thanks in advance if anyone is feeling generous :)
2404	False	a	Shit ima get downvoted to hell. 
2405	True	a	EDIT: There was a change of plans and I am leaving tonight, so I no longer need a pizza. I'll just eat when I get home.   I posted yesterday under r/randomactsofpizza yesterday because I didn't know about this one before hand  I'm over in Port Orchard, WA dog sitting for some people, and I was under the impression they were going to leave me some food to eat. They aren't coming back until very late tonight and until then I don't have many options until they pay me.  What I can offer is a picture of me, the dog, and the pizza as soon as I get home on Tuesday.  A pepperoni pizza would be a great lunch and dinner for me, and I would really appreciate one. Danke danke sehr.   Lindsey
2406	False	a	we have used all of our food money for a month because me and my brother and friend just finished remodeling my brothers room because his room was ugly looking hahahah. and we dont get paid till monday and we were just wondering if any of you noble people of RAOP will give us something that will feed 3 hungry people! thank you :] if you are interested i will give you 3 dollars on the psn store for exchange.
2407	False	a	My fiancee and I are usualy broke as my fiancee is on disability and I stay at home to take care of her. A pizza would be a wonderful treat for us.  Thanks! -Mac
2408	False	a	No Sob Story. I am at work and all i have it the chicken the turned rock hard in the fridge...
2409	True	a	Hello! I haven't had any pizza in a while, due to being extremely tight on funds. My dream is to have a slice to remind myself of the better things in life. I'm not sure what I can do to receive pizza, but I'm open to suggestions! Thanks again.
2410	False	a	"Hey RaoP, first time posting here, but I've seen this and other ""Random Acts of ..."" threads before. As the title says, I'm a down-on-his-luck post-graduate living paycheck-to-paycheck, and these past few days have been hard on me. I can't really afford groceries until my next paycheck, walk seven miles a day to/from work (cumulative, not each way), can't afford lunch so I don't break for it, and I would really just love to sit down after a long day and stuff my face with some hot, cheesy, saucy goodness (also, I'd get to have the leftovers for lunch!). Anyway, if a kind redditor can help out I would greatly appreciate it, and if not, that's perfectly fine too. "
2411	True	a	Asking in advance, I'm moving out next wednesday and it would be awesome if the first meal me and my other half get to eat together in the unit was a delicious pizza. We won't be able to afford much good food for a while because we've had to buy a lot of furniture and stuff and we're gonna be a bit short on cash. If anyone was willing to do this that would be amazing.
2412	True	a	Hey. Im 19 and I live in California. Im inbetween jobs and waiting on my EBT card. I have no money at the moment. A pizza would really help fill an empty stomach
2413	False	a	I feel bad for asking, but this is probably the hardest point of my life so far. I just graduated high school, and i got kicked out right away. I've been living with my boyfriend but hes just as broke as i am. If anyone could help me out right now, i'd be highly grateful and will return the offer when possible. :)  btw, sorry for the sketchy account. I'm a lurker (never really felt the need to comment on stuff. =/)
2414	False	a	Not a charity case, but we would sure like a pizza!
2415	True	a	Have enough for a few meals for the next 2 days, but would love to have a nice pizza!
2416	True	a	Just spent almost $1600 on my car to get it through emissions in order to renew the registration, which expired yesterday and also replace the waterpump which went at the same time. Still need to wait until my next paycheck in order to afford to pay this year's car taxes and the renewal fee. I had to borrow money and use all of my check in order to cover it so far.  But the good news is, not only did I get a promotion at my full time job, I was also hired as a freelance on call artist for MAC Cosmetics, which pays MUCH more than what I earn at my full time job. Hopefully within the next two or three months I'll be in a place where I don't feel like I have to ask the internet for food and I can give away pizza like woah.  So this is kind of a desperately hungry/celebration pizza!  There's a Pizza Hut and Dominos that both deliver near me. I'd seriously be grateful. Thanks!
2417	True	a	It's been a tough day. I ate the last of my oatmeal this morning and haven't eaten since. Most of my last paycheck went to rent and utilities, and I don't get paid until Friday. I'm in for a rough couple of days. If someone out there can help, I'll be more than happy to comp someone else in need a pizza when I get paid.
2418	False	a	For the past couple of weeks the college campus here has taken away a majority of money. This last week has been the worst as I contracted the usual bout of seasonal illness. Recently I had to fill in applications to stay in their dorms for this summer, and also this fall. This has come with the unfortunate circumstances of rules, vague descriptions, loopholes, and lots of spending. Turns out that if I only sent in one application for /both/ summer/fall at the time the summer applications were due, I would only have had to pay 40 dollars instead of 80. Loopholes! D:  I do believe someone else definitely needs a pizza more than I do, and while I am finally getting better, I would like a pick-me-up from this frantic week. There's about 2 dollars in my account right now, and this is not enough for a pizza.
2419	False	a	My 18th birthday tomorrow. Not doing anything because all my friends have school but would like a pizza to eat while Im home chillin with my new kitten, Mrs.Nesbitt. :)
2420	False	a	"I have ramen, and a couple old soups. I'm not really in dire circumstances, just trying to get myself out of credit debt from years ago. (this was to take care of my late mother though). I also got hit with that magic ""planets align to form one super big billing cycle with all my bills"" time. I don't really expect any pizza, but if someone is rich and bored, i'm merely an outlet. My only offer to you is that i promise, on the soul of my dearest mother, to pay it forward in the coming weeks. Bothell, wa (just north of seattle)"
2421	False	a	Me and the fam damily would love some pizza for supper tonight, so I figured hell, let's give it a go :-)
2422	False	a	Hi guys, I'm new to RAOP. I'm just hungry and don't get paid until thursday. If someone hooked it up, I'd be more than happy to pay you back next weekend with some pizza!!
2423	False	a	I've been unemployed for a little over a month and my financial situation is extremely dire for the next week or so.  Just started a new job today and the future is looking bright, but this week will be extremely tough. Thanks for reading!
2424	True	a	I'm a pizza guy (I know, the irony..) and while I was at work last week someone pulled out in front of me and I t-boned them. We were both ok, but a few days later I found out she doesn't have insurance (She gave the officer a expired or fake card) and is apparently off the grid. Long story short, I haven't been able to work all week and I won't be getting any form of money until sometime next week.   I can give proof of my situation if wanted, but I don't want to post the accident report for all to see. 
2425	True	a	Well, this is my first time on RAoP. So I figured I'd try it out. I'm home sick today, don't have my license (thank you bureaucracy), with a beat up leg (http://i.imgur.com/jrQCk.jpg), broke (http://i.imgur.com/DNEEd.jpg ) (The irony is the picture of the contents of my wallet has 'need' in the URL). Anyways, if someone could get me some pizza before 5 today, I would love you forever. Anyways, thanks in advance. P.S. Just whacked my head getting up to get my iphone to take some proof pics. Anyways :P
2426	False	a	For obvious reasons, I created a new account for this request. To prove that I'm not just trolling you guys, I took [a picture](http://imgur.com/a/r24Lh) of my medication bottle and some of the literature I was given at the appointment where I had to terminate the pregnancy.   Before anyone judges me (though I know this is a friendly group of people; I have been fortunate enough to receive before under my real username), I believe I did the right thing, and my partner didn't just abandon me after I did this. I got the (*gulp*) abortion on Friday, and he made sure I was taken care of during the worst of the aftermath. But today, he's at work, and I'm pretty much confined to the couch. There is food in the house, but it's stuff I'd have to prepare. Preparing a real meal for just myself while I'm still crampy doesn't seem like fun right now...  I'm willing to reveal my identity and real username to the person willing to gift me, in private of course, to also prove that I've been on reddit for quite some time. I also have a few bucks here for a tip for a delivery driver (I obviously can't drive right now).   I know there are people on here who haven't received who are more deserving, but I'd love some comfort food. Absolute understanding if no one feels like it, though. :-)
2427	False	a	Hi, I am sorry to be here making a request. I am completly out of food stamps and a few days out until I get any cash. I was recently homeless and a friend let me move in with them and my children. It is suppose to be my night to figure out dinner but it is difficult with no food stamps or cash right now. I am in the Massachusettes area and could really use the help right now. Thank you and God Bless
2428	False	a	9 kids to feed, health took down spiral, and job closed to due economy. Appreciating any help necessary. If able e-card is sufficient.
2429	True	a	Hello! My son (8) and I are were just talking about Pizza, he loves it. (of course!) We live within or means and don't eat out often, but he is making me crave Pizza now. I then remembered this little nook on Reddit. It's our first time requesting, and I will offer when I have the extra cash! =) Here's our pic! http://imgur.com/9n55g and we have a verification code! Thank you! 
2430	False	a	So today is my older brother's 18th birthday. We were looking forward to making him a big birthday dinner and everything. Well every year on his birthday he's been stuck at the doctor's office or the dentist. This year it's happened again. My sister has pneumonia in her left lung and is in the ER so no birthday dinner for him sadly. It'd be nice to get a pizza or two for him to celebrate.  And if you can't give a pizza, prayers &amp; best wishes for him and my sister are just as much appreciated. Thanks guys!
2431	True	a	**Warning:** *This may be cheesy.*     I would sure love a pizza   the problem is, I'm broke   I would use 420 as a reason   but I cant, cause I don't toke    my mouth is a' watering   just typing this freakin poem   sauce and cheese and cheese and sauce   and Mountain Dew a flowin'    oh how I could only hope   to burn my lips tonight   on a steaming melty greasy peice   of a glorious pizza pie    Im not here to look for pity   but on this poem I must amend   I felt like a baller on last friday   but Im counting change this weekend    The food in the fridge is old and moldy   even though once it was hoarded wealth   I would clean it out but I cant   'cause it would be hazardous to my health    basically what Im saying is   I love pizza more than life   and I would LOVE to take you guys up   if someone's a' offerin' a slice    *Seriously though, you guys are awesome. I love Reddit.* 
2432	False	a	Just got home off of a long ass drive from Fountain, Michigan back home to Racine, Wisconsin all in one run. Too tired to make dinner but I can offer you a pretty sweet picture of the sunrise on Lake Michigan http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/215431_10152018722100414_1224859864_n.jpg
2433	False	a	you know how good pizza is when you're drunk!! holler at a girl and if you're in the area i'll save you some for breakfast tomorrow
2434	False	a	I am feeling depressed. I do not know if it is the study of law and the tedious reading that goes with it or the hunger in my belly causing it. If some kind soul wishes to help me eliminate the hunger in my belly, we can narrow the source. I would eternally grateful to any kind soul wishing to assist me in these trying times.
2435	False	a	So it's been a while since it's happened, but yeah. Just got dumped by a girl I like... My brother has used up pretty much everything in the freezer. I would really appreciate a pizza right now...
2436	True	a	"I have been hard at work trying to catch I_rape_cats and would like some pie to feed myself and the two other rapist catchers.   Just kidding, were not really looking for I_rape_cats! My kids and I are at home and would love some pie. Its about dinner time and when asked they said they wanted pizza. We just spent our ""Entertainment"" money on stuff for our foster dog that we took in from a local private dog shelter. He is a shy dog and was beaten severely so were trying to make him in to a vital part of our pack so he can someday be adopted by a family that needs a loving kind dog.   Lets not get stuff twisted, we have food and will not starve. However, we would like to get some pizza.   Thanks to everyone that offers anyone pizza on here. each and everyone of you make a difference in someones day. "
2437	True	a	So here's the deal:  I didn't know my college had shortened dinner hours on Sunday (only been here a week!) and was so busy catching up on work for my Comp Sci class that I missed eating.  Every place to eat on campus is closed early and I'm on a campus just far enough from town to make walking for food slightly dangerous.  I'm going to be up late programming and I'm starting to get really, really hungry...    In exchange I can offer an Android app in which you draw doodles on a cat face. [Screenshot](http://imgur.com/zuURi)  I'm in MA, by the way :) 
2438	True	a	I'm a music teacher who also teaches private lessons.  I just got home from lessons today and I'm spent.  I don't have the energy to cook dinner and decided I'd be willing to write an original song on the topic of your choice and record it for you.  The instrumentation will be guitar and voice.  History is filled with musicians and benefactors.  Haydn had the Esterhazy family, Mozart had the Archbishop of Salzburg, Bach had the Duke of Saxeweimar (who threw him in jail).  I could have you (for a much cheaper price I might add).  Seriously, any topic you want.  You want a song, I want a pizza.  Let's make this happen.
2439	True	a	Not too much of a sad story, just an overworked, incredibly stressed out mama here who is very tired of eating Ramen for ALL the meals. Had a really crazy week, especially yesterday... And would love the relief of not slaving over hot stove for the kids dinner &amp; then eating Ramen myself.  Never done this before, so I don't quite know what else I need to do. But if anyone is willing to help... I can pay it forward on the 10th :)   Ughh I thought I put this in the title. Sorry! I'm in Kansas City, MO :)
2440	False	a	I just moved to Austin, Texas from a small town in west Texas to look for a job and try to make it in the big city. I'm sleeping on a friends floor and living out of a suitcase. I gave my friend most of the money I had to put towards utilities and bills since he's on disability and is barely scraping by himself. I've applied for food stamps and have an interview on Monday, but some pizza to help me through the weekend would be a godsend. I only have like $12 but I really need to save that for bus fair or toothpaste or something. Anyway, I guess this is a shot in the dark but I'm hungry and desperate so I'll try anything. Once I get on my feet I'll be more than happy to pass the favor on. Thanks for reading =]
2441	True	a	Hey R+, So here i am in africa for the past few months. About 2 weeks before i left for Africa my wife and i had a beautiful baby Girl. My wife is still back home in Warner Robins. She has taken care of the home front and done quite well at it. It has been hard on her though, She is new to the states (&lt;1yr) and the bit of seclusion and being stuck at home with our baby has kinda worn her out.   I am looking to try and surprise her and brighten her day a bit in different way.  If anyone would be willing to help out We Both would greatly appreciate it.   IN Summary: We live in Warner Robins Georgia, Wifey is kinda bummed w/ me being gone and i am trying a different route of brightening her day.   PS: I do have a verification code, (not sure how it works) 
2442	True	a	Y_Y. Sorry, **do not** want to sound like a pity party, but I was on my way to Vermont from California to go back to school when Irene hurricane shit all over my face. Now I'm stranded in Chicago and I don't know what to do with myself since this has never happened to me before whilst traveling alone. I'm only a naive, pitiful 19 year old after all :(. And, the room charge was ridiculous so I can't really spare the moola for any delicious pie right now.   Well anyway, even if I don't receive any pizza tonight, daz cool! I know I'm not the only idiot attempting fly during a hurricane. Just some comments would greatly brighten my night! 
2443	False	a	Now I can't say we haven't eaten recently, but  our dinners have not been the best, this week has been filled with oatmeal,  corndogs, hot dogs and bowls of rice. We could really use some flavor this weekend.
2444	False	a	Much appreciated, i really have had a horrible week.
2445	False	a	"I feel absolutely horrible for asking here in light of the tragedy on the East Coast, but I am at my Wit's end. I've literally just had the tv classic ""Well, it can't get any worse..."" moment, and then literally within 5 minutes Storm clouds moved in and it started pouring down raining, and I am without shelter.   I was planning on walking downtown to a 24 hour cafe and trying to sort things out there. My only friend in the world is out of town all weekend. A nearby inn is letting me sit in their lobby, for now.   I was also going to stop by a store to grab a bite to eat (food stamps), but that's not possible anymore with this storm. I could really use a warm pick me up reddit. I'm cold, wet, and starving.   I will be glad to answer any questions of how I got into this predicament or provide any proof about my situation if you want, don't want to take up space or time. "
2446	False	a	I was just informed that I have been retroactively fired on May 18, 2011. I have been out of work with an injury and I was just about to go back when I got this lovely news via email. As you can imagine this has thrown me into a panic over how I am going to pay for rent and food. It will all work out, it always does, but things look a bit bleak at the moment. I would love a pizza to eat while I go over my resume! 
2447	False	a	I'm a Single Mother that was forced to move out of my cousin's basement due to flooding caused by hurricane Irene. My children &amp; I have just moved into an apartment, but money is a little tight. It would be amazing to get some pizza!
2448	False	a	Poor college kids who want to eat:(
2449	False	a	Basically I am a university student and I was hit by an unexpected utility bill and a requirement to pay a retainer on the property that I am moving in to next year for over the summer...these two things have cleaned me out! I am flying out to America with an organisation that places us in summer camps on the 16th but until then I have only 49 pence in my account! If any kind redditor can assist, let me know... 
2450	False	a	"I would be so grateful to anyone, if they could help me out with a pizza. Other than the last piece of bread, I've been without food for 2 days.   When people look in their fridge, or pantry, and say ""there's no food!"" usually there is a lot of food, just not food they want to eat. If you look into my fridge and pantry, you will see some butter, some cooking oils, and a bit of milk.   Le sigh. ;.;  I live in Canada. "
2451	False	a	"I am a complete wimp when it comes to the dentist, to the point where I get IV sedation for something as simple as a routine checkup, even though it really doesn't seem to help. Today will be my first ever root canal so needless to say I am extremely nervous because of all of the ""horror stories"" I have heard from others who have had root canals.  A pizza obviously wouldn't make me any less nervous about the dentist but it would help make my day a bit better and would be very much appreciated. I promise to pay it forward when I start working in a few weeks."
2452	False	a	Decorating the Christmas tree (finally) and would love an easy and delicious dinner of pizza. This is our first time posting here and i must say its pretty damn awesome... whether we get pizza'd or not we will try and pizza someone soon! :)
2453	True	a	Lost my job in December.  I've been actively looking for a new one.  Worked as a security guard for a week before getting laid off.  Been going to interviews but still no positions yet.  I've completely run out of money and am basically stuck in my house, saving what little gas I have left for pursuing job prospects.  I've been eating through the last of my ramen during this past week or so and slowly depleting my reserve of oatmeal.  If anyone could send a pepperoni pizza, I'll be sure to keep the pizza-karma flowing once I land on my feet.  I'm also completely open to repaying the pizza favor with some non-money related favor, just let me know what you need.  ***EDIT:*** Pizza just arrived, thanks to clearmoon247!!!!!
2454	True	a	First request, will pay it forward when we're feeling better.
2455	False	a	Unfortunately, chicken ramen doesn't hold a candle to a pizza. I could sure go for a pizza, will pay it forward as soon as possible. Thanks. 
2456	False	a	Hi guys i'm  new to this site.. so I guess i'm just supposed to tell my story... alright here it goes lol.. I am a single mother of two.. no sob story don't worry.. I just graduated High School i did it online at Pennfoster.edu I do have a job but unfortunately don't get paid until friday. I will pay someone back or give a pizza on Friday. I'm just so excited I finally graduated by the way i'm 20 and could really use a warm pizza until I go grocery shopping on Friday!! thanks for reading :) 
2457	False	a	There`s these ladies who always work in the Wilson subway station. One of them has a toddler and brings her over all the time. They work so hard, and they deserve to have a slice of pizza. Maybe crowd their business and make a lot of purchases or tips. Because sometimes I see the tip cup and it`s only filled with quarters. Let`s turn those quarters into dollars, into bills!
2458	False	a	Paid rent to my roommate for the first, no paycheck until Friday! Could really use a Domino's gift card, there is a Domino's down the street from me...will pay it forward this coming Friday now that rent is taken care of!
2459	False	a	I get paid towards the end of the week, and have been living off of Ramen and cut up hot dogs for the past three days. The money I have left in my account is going to (hopefully) buy me enough gas to get to and from work till pay day.  I'm to the point to where if I eat any more of the same stuff, I'll probably vomit.  An online friend told me about this sub-reddit so I figured I would give it a shot, and would be more than willing to lend a helping hand to someone who is in my position in the future. 
2460	False	a	No sad story, i'm just a really hungry (and broke) student working on an essay that's due tomorrow. Wrote 1500 words yesterday thinking I could write another 2000 easily...I was wrong aha.   It's shitty cause if i'm this broke now, I'm going to be even more broke next year with tuition hikes. 
2461	False	a	It's currently 105 where I'm at, my car has no A/C so the drive to get anything leaves you sweatin' balls. A helpful redditor would be awesome:D 
2462	False	a	Like I said, he has been working towards this for quite awhile now, and after getting through by the skin of his teeth he is now a teacher in southern ontario. He has been working at the honda plant for quite a while but he couldn't quit because we always needed the money to get by. Now I'm moved away and wanted to congratulate him with his favorite food... pizza! :)
2463	False	a	I have had few too many things go wrong in the past couple of weeks... Really craving some comfort food! 
2464	False	a	So, about a 2 months ago, I found a job. It took me three months of searching, and this one was part time and only paid about $650 a month- barely enough to get rent and food out of the way. The rest of my expenses have been coming out of my dwindling savings account for a while now.  I also got a stress fracture in my foot about a year ago. I was in and out of a walking boot for about 5 months altogether, and my doctor and I thought it was healed. I could walk 2-3 miles at a time and not encounter any pain and I thought I was in the clear.  And then I got this job, which required standing in one place for 8 hrs at a time. I did fine at the beginning, but then the pain started coming back. I guess my foot just couldn't take it. I got an ultrasound on it two days ago. Turns out the fracture has broken again, and I now also have arthritis in the surrounding area. I'm back in a walking boot. The one I have this time had to be a loaner from the doctor's office because insurance wouldn't pay for a new one. This one goes up to my knee and is a size too big, and it's hard to get around in it.  (I've also figured out that I can't really get worker's comp for it because it was a gradual injury, and in Virginia you're required to have a specific accident happen. It's also unlikely to happen because it happened previously not in the context of work.)   My boss got really snippy with me when I quit, and I just had to sit there crying for a while after I hung up the phone.  So, I'd love some pizza. I could make it last for a few days, and that'd be 3-4 meals that I wouldn't have to stand up to make. It'd be really helpful. As soon as I get a job where I'm not struggling to get rent, utilities, and food out of the way, I will definitely return the favor to someone else who needs it.  Sorry for the longwinded-ness, I'm just really not having a good time right now. :(  TL;DR: Broken foot causes me to lose shitty job that barely paid my expenses anyway. Would love pizza. Would also love to give pizza when I can afford it.
2465	True	a	"About two months ago, myself and three friends from high school moved into a cabin in North Western Indiana, that was built by one of my friends father.  We resorted to the cabin because we all work at McDonalds and could not afford anything else.  The place needed a lot of work as no one has lived in it for fifteen years prior to us.  Raccoons had torn out most of the dry wall and even got inside the cabin.  Nonetheless we were really excited about the whole rustic feel that the cabin gave off, ...... until it started getting cold.  We have only had a few frost nights so far, but Winter is Coming.  Our Cabin is not exactly ""factory sealed"" and doesn't exactly have a ""heater"".  So as Northern Indiana's harsh winter approaches we are feverishly (literally and figuratively) trying to figure out how to heat our cabin.  If someone would like to buy us a pizza to lift our spirits we would be greatly appreciative and we will pay it forward."
2466	False	a	"I was laid off 2 months ago and due to bureaucratic bullshit I still haven't received any employment insurance. Damn, maybe I wont get any! Today I realized that after my rent is paid, I only have 9 bucks left...   I don't really worry about food because I have a lot of rice and beans. But I'm getting really tired of rice and beans, rice pudding, fried rice, bean stew and etc. I crave for a pizza! But, I don't like asking for help. So if i get a pizza, I promise it's going to be a ""today you, tomorrow me"" thing. As soon as I get a new job or my EI, I will give back a pizza to someone on this sub!  Thanks in advance!"
2467	True	a	My fiance and I are both starting our second year of college, and we got an apartment this year.  Long story short, she's from out of state, so her tuition and class fee's were doubled, and it ate up most of our money.  Add in having to pay out of our pocket to clean our apartment we JUST moved into to make it anywhere near livable, and I'm stuck with $0.57 in my name until my paycheck hits the 21st.   So... If you want to cheer two broke college students on a ramen-diet up, it'd be much appreciated!  EDIT:internet derped, so this didn't show up the first time.  Some1Random has already PMed and offered, so a big cheer to him.  Thank you to others for caring though ^^
2468	False	a	So I'm new to this website and not really sure what it's about. I heard through a friend though that you guys helped him out by giving him a free pizza when he was in need so I'm here today to see if you could do the same for my roommates and I. The three of us moved into our first apartment today so none of us have a job at the moment and my financial aid won't be in until next week sometime! We are in need plz help! XD
2469	True	a	i couldnt afford to take the gf out for our 9 yr anniversary.. been applying to jobs round the clock but nobody is hiring out here. i'd really appreciate it if somebody could throw me a giftcard or something, otherwise it's ramen again for dinner. (and we're running low on that, too)  either way, thanks to y'all for being so awesome and helping out others. this subreddit warms my heart.  (north hollywood, CA)
2470	False	a	I am very starving at the moment and i have nothing to eat i am willing to do anything for food, Please help.  I live in Salem, NH
2471	False	a	Well I am in louisville and I am broke right now and My friend told me about this site that u all help with pizza .I am very hungry and have nothing right now .I am a part time worker at a warehouse and I dont get paid until monday and my bills took all my money I had.Just seeing if anyone could help with some pizza tonight for me so I am not hungry thanks
2472	True	a	I'm 30 weeks pregnant and desperately craving pizza, but I can't really justify spending the money on it while I'm saving up for the baby's arrival.  If anyone wants to help me out it would be incredible! 
2473	False	a	She is hungry and I have pretty much run out of decent food to eat in the house.  I don't want her to suffer from another night of ramen and water, can anyone please help me out?    *EDIT*  I am in the Wisconsin area, if it matters.
2474	False	a	My friend is helping me out by housing while i find a place of my own, but he's out of town and doesn't have any food in his place, and he's out for the weekend.  If anyone could help me feed myself this weekend I would be happy to pay it forward when I'm on my feet, thanks!
2475	False	a	But I'm still trying to keep my head up, It's not all bad though, I passed my Exams and not failing. But now I'm home filling out applications really hungry and tired of Ramen noodles. Thanks in advance!
2476	False	a	 I just started a new job about a week ago, and I have .62 cents in my bank account. Luckily I bought a bus pass to get me to and from work before I ran out of money. I'm finally getting up on my feet but right now is the hardest time for me. I would be homeless if not for my best friends parents who took me in. Please, it would really help me out... I know I can make a pizza last at least a few days. Anything helps out in these times.
2477	False	a	I am a college student who ate way too much ramen last semester since it was all I could afford. Its all I have in the house right now, but I would really love some pizza. I live in richmond, va.
2478	False	a	Hi everybody. First off, i know this is a new account, but i can provide proof of who I am and my situation. I have been a lurked for a while and even been to a meet-up! I have two little girls and live in an apartment with them. Times have been tough lately with bills and expenses. If somebody would be willing to help us out, we would greatly appreciate it. 
2479	False	a	First time being poor, not quite sure how to handle it...pizza would help the situation
2480	False	a	I don't get to see my dad very much, because my parents are divorced. He usually makes spaghetti or fried chicken for dinner when I am with him. Would love to have some pizza with him tomorrow night.
2481	True	a	First time here, I have been living off of canned/packaged foods, which gets old fast. Since I can't afford to treat myself to cheesy goodness, can I please get a pizza? Please and thank you!
2482	False	a	Oh, and I've got dog food. Would love it if someone got me some pizza. I would appreciate it so much. 
2483	True	a	Hey RAoP. Tomorrow is my 22nd birthday, and I'm barely able to eat. I just recently got a job after moving here a few weeks ago, and haven't been paid or had any money at all to spend on decent food. Even worse, I suffer from Crohn's disease, and not eating is making my stomach flare up like you wouldn't believe. I could really, seriously use the food right now. Thanks for the consideration.  Edit: Pizza'd! Thank you, ninjaliwa!
2484	False	a	I'm not gonna lie, money is tight for just about everyone. My mother lost her second job a month or so ago. We've been fine but the fridge is usually close to empty. Except lately its filled with eggs. Literally three fucking cartons. I've been looking for a job for a while and finally got one. But I don't start work for about a month so I can't as of yet contribute to the household. So I beg of you Reddit, please send me pizza because as good as eggs are, I fear I may soon suffer a heart attack or turn into an egg myself.
2485	False	a	Hello I posted last night but forgot to put the proper tags. yesterday I had to spend a weeks pay getting my car fixed, there is no food in the house, i've had a cheese sandwich and four peanut butter crackers since yesterday.
2486	False	a	Totally broke and would really enjoy a warm pizza. It has been forever since I have had one, now that I'm broke pizza is more of a luxury.
2487	True	a	[PIZZA RECIEVED] Thanks so much iweararubber. Got dinner and lunch for the next few days.  You're a life saver!  
2488	False	a	 I'm a college student cramming for finals tomorrow. A pizza would be hugely appreciated. 
2489	False	a	I'm house/dog sitting for a friend this week who has no food in his house (except for the dog), and I'm broke until he gets back and pays me.  I'd love to kick back with the pup, a pizza, and some movies tonight, and I fully intend on paying it forward once I get some funds.  Happy Halloween!
2490	False	a	I don't really know the right format. sorry. I don't have starving kids or cats, but I would enjoy a pizza.  NC,USA.  Thanks in advance.       PS: trust me, my cats are not starving.  actually they are getting a little chunky.
2491	False	a	went broke 2 days ago (Rent, school loans). I  dont get paid until another week if anyone out there in SF can help with a nice pepperoni pie you would be praised with my thoughts for ever!, never really done this before kinda feel a bit shameful for asking, will gladly return the favor. idk if it matters im in north beach area. Thanks for those who read this.
2492	False	a	I've recently moved to Albany, NY and the rent/deposit drained my account. Been surviving on ramen noodles and potatos while job searching and would love something different for dinner tonight. Cheese, Pepperoni, it doesn't matter which.
2493	False	a	I'm amazed that such a thing exists! I don't really know how this works, but if someone could get us a pizza we would be so grateful! We would eat the whole thing with much happy yelling while watching The Iron Giant. 
2494	False	a	I'm out of food stamps till the 6th, and I've been eating fruits and vegetables salvaged from dumpsters behind high end grocery store in Berkley. While pizza probably isn't the healthiest source of it, the lack of protein I'm getting from my current diet is making me rather weak, and to be honest, I'm getting rather burnt out of potatoes, carrots, and apples. A pizza would be absolutely killer right now. Please help a girl out, I promise I'll return the favor to someone else in need once I'm less down on my luck.  Edit: A friend of mine just came over with a few groceries for me, so I no longer need a pizza, but if you're still willing to give me one, I'll happily take it.
2495	True	a	Im a single parent and I recently had an unexpected medical expense which took all of my money until this payday on friday. My son and I have been living off Ramen but i currently ran out I just need a quick break if anyone can help it will be greatly appreciated. Im a paramedic I try to make a difference I just need help right now, thank you.
2496	True	a	A friend at work just told me about this site because she knows the situation I am in. I am a hard working mother of 4 who struggles from paycheck to paycheck. I get paid every two weeks and this week is a non pay week. I am flat broke and need help feeding my children.... my husband and i both will do without as long as my children can eat. I never miss a day at work but it never seems to be enough. My husband has been laid off and I am doing the best i can as a mother and wife to make it work. Any assistance at all will be more than appreciated.
2497	True	a	Well, you probably have read similar posts already. Still I have to try.  So situation is this: I had sort of a big fight with my parents who up until a two month ago helped me financially out while I am studying for my bachelor degree. Well coming this month the fees were due and while I sort of managed to pay them I now have a three digits debt on my account. And this is the start of the month.  I have good chances (okok... let's say medium chances) on getting a part time job beginning of November but this doesn't really help for now.   I am though a hobbyist digital artist. This is my deviantart profile: http://shadom86.deviantart.com/ While I can't promise anything, I might be able to make a picture for you. Providing you want me to.  Anyway? Anyone out there who feels very generous?  
2498	True	a	Mass., US.  I'm flat out broke until tomorrow with no food in the house for dinner tonight.  My daughter is 2 and we usually do a pizza and movie night every once in a while, and she's been asking about it.  I've got rent and car payment coming up, and bill collectors calling.  I try to not let my wife know exactly how bad we are when it gets like this, but she mentioned we didn't have anything for dinner tonight, and I can't get groceries until tomorrow.  Can anyone help out?  Thanks a billion.
2499	False	a	Graduate Student, Stuck at school all day, classes at night, just hungry and want a pizza if one would be so kind.  Thanks.
2500	False	a	Hi Reddit, I don't really like asking for help but my daughter and I just moved into our apartment a week ago and we are going through a bit of a rough patch [financially](http://i.imgur.com/9IH4v.jpg). At the moment we have [no food](http://imgur.com/a/UCUvL#0) except some condiments. My daughter is extremely hungry and words can not describe how low I feel about not being able to feed her. I really thought I planned things out well but I did not. And now she has to suffer for my screw up.  As I stated [I have Paypal cash](http://imgur.com/2AO2c), but I do not have a paypal debit card, If someone would want to do a trade I'd appreciate it. If anyone can help but does not have a Paypal I can send you a [$25 Bath and body works GC](http://imgur.com/a/UCUvL#0). It is my fault that I did not plan things correctly, and this is my last option for today to make things right for my daughter. I am not in any way shape or form asking for a handout or a freebie, I just want to make a simple trade so my daughter and I can eat tonight. I'm not posting on my real account because I'm ashamed that things turned out this way and I feel I should only be here to help and not to be helped. But I can do a trade and pay it forward to make it up. If you want any more proof please don't hesitate to ask, I can give my account name and more picture, even a picture of my state ID. 
2501	True	a	I just started classes this week, and I probably won't have any money for a couple more weeks. I'm running pretty low on food and a pizza could feed me for at least a few days. Situation's no more complicated than that. When I get some money, I'd love to return the favor.  Thanks guys. :)
2502	False	a	We're not in the biggest of pickles, but let us plead or case.  &lt;in Pocatello, ID for work. Been here for about a week but haven't been paid yet. &lt;ran out of money two days ago, and went through the rest of our raman. &lt;dying for dinner.  Two 23year-old painters could really use a pizza. And I promise if this works I'll pay it back with a large as soon as I get back to Colorado.
2503	False	a	This is my first request. I'm a student studying abroad in China, and a recent illness cost me a bit more money than I anticipated. I have over a month left here, and I would really appreciate the help.  You can check my post history for proof of my studies, and I have a verification code. Please let me know if you have any questions, and, if you're able to help, thank you so much.  EDIT: About 45 minutes left to order tonight. I'll update when they're no longer accepting orders, so message me any time before then. I'm really hungry :(  **EDIT 2: Ordering is closed for tonight. Perhaps some other time, though. Thanks, guys.**
2504	False	a	I'll keep this short, but a failed transmission have put my partner and I behind close to around $1000 with repairs, hotels, and other things. We were heading to Boston, already booked, and couldn't cancel our hotel, losing us another couple hundred. While we should be able to get going again tomorrow, we are between paychecks and would really appreciate the help of anyone who is willing to help.  At this point, we are hungry, not picky at all, and hoping to repay this subreddit back when we're back in Montana.   If you're willing to help, please let me know. I will do whatever I can to repay it to you, or on your behalf.
2505	True	a	Honestly, I didn't want to come down to this and request a pizza, but I haven't ate anything all day but rice. Finals are coming up for my summer session and I would appreciate a pizza to cheer me up. If you can't I completely understand I plan to give back once I get a paycheck. I'm located in New Jersey. Thanks for everything.
2506	True	a	Title says it all. Alone tonight with an empty bank account, maxed out credit card, and a new job interview in the morning (thanks /r/atljobs!).
2507	False	a	Hi guys. I'm home for the weekend with my siblings and tonight I have to babysit them both. It would mean everything to me of I could show them that I'm still fun like I was before I was broke and still living at home with them. Pictures of smiling faces would happily be uploaded as proof :) Thank you so much to anyone that can manage to help out with a surprise pizza
2508	False	a	THIS GUY!! I was gonna do a weird punchline involving some kind of cuddly animal, but then I realized most animals don't have thumbs...or do they...? Anyways I'm going to be honest here, I really am hungry; totally famished, and I've been listening to my stomach growl since I've woken up. Basically I'm waiting for school to start so I can receive my financial aid in order to purchase books and more importantly FOOD. Unfortunately that isn't for another 2 weeks....which has kind of left me in a desperate situation. Hence the RAOP request. For those wary gifters out there I know...this is a new account and thus this request will probably be treated as a scam but I assure you that I am indeed a real live hungry college student. Starving, some might say, stupid as well for hoping $150 could buy me a months worth of food, but alas, a man can dream. Anyways, a pizza or a gift card would really go a long way; a gift card more so because I would stave off hunger as long as possible, but any food right now would be fantastic and I would really appreciate the help. Well, thanks for reading.
2509	True	a	I am an unemployed musician in Tennessee who can't offer much except a place to stay and some possible unpaid shows to bands passing through. I am currently hosting a 4 piece band from upstate NY for a couple of days. Normally we can busk downtown for some extra food money but we've only made $13 bucks between the 5 of us in the past couple of days. Any help with a couple of pizzas and I'll send you a free download link!  EDIT: SallyMacLennane just made everyones night! Not only will I personally be paying this back, but the boys in the band have all subscribed and plan on doing their thing to help out in the future!
2510	True	a	We recently lost a job in the family and are now having to make a quick move back to Oregon. We've overdrawn our bank accounts and our cupboards are quite barren.   We have PAX LoL champion codes and Wreck-It Ralph avatar item codes to offer in return for delicious pizza. 
2511	False	a	So I figure you may like some background information.  I parked my car in my apartment complexes parking lot over night and when I woke up the next morning to head to work I saw that my windshield had looked like it was hit with a baseball bat.  [A picture of my windshield](http://i.imgur.com/TjMr1ml.jpg)  So anyway, I call a local glass shop to get my window fixed and they say they can do it the next day while I'm at work.  The next day happens and I am getting ready to leave work and my windshield is still broken.  Because they couldn't keep to their schedule, I decided to cancel with them and call a separate place.  They come and fix it the next day and were super professional about the entire thing.  However, when they replaced the windshield they took my parking permit for my apartment complex with the old windshield.  So now I have been having to find street parking every day until my apartment complex's office is open so I can try to get a new one from them.  I am just lucky I saw that my sticker was gone before my car got towed.   Anyway, tldr; My car windshield got hit with what looks like a baseball bat and would appreciate some pizza!
2512	False	a	Somebody would brighten up my day a lot. We were engaged but he decided that he just didn't care anymore. I honestly hate asking for help, but I guess this is an exception. It's pretty loserly, but Reddit has been one of the only things I have to get me through the day. 
2513	False	a	me and my fiancee are a little low on money right now, fear not we shall be able to get a food shop in about 2 weeks. but for now we're kinda bummed out about not having money for the steam sale but some pizza would certainly help lift the mood. can you help us RAOP?
2514	False	a	I am a stay at home mom of two kids i live with my husband his parents and my kids! The only reason that I am unemployed is because my husband was hit by a drunk driver a little over a year ago and was seriously injured and was almost killed! so i quit work to help him through recovery and take care of the kids while living with my in-laws off of their ssi checks (which are tiny)! Its the end of the month and we're broke! We are not starving but we aren't eating all that well either! Please be my pizza hero!
2515	True	a	Hey RAOP! I am currently unemployed and just graduate from Missouri State with a degree in journalism. Life's been hard recently and I only have 60 bucks to spend over the next 2 1/2 weeks. My food stamps ran out and I cannot get back on the for another 3 weeks.   I would love a pizza, because as of late, I have been eating one package of Ramen a day. I am about to go to the store to get my dog some more food, and probably will only have 45 dollars left after that.   My parents are in a similar situation and really cannot help me. I have never been in such a poor situation my entire life, and some pizza would definitely make my situation a lot more tolerable!   Thanks! 
2516	False	a	Were a family of 5.We just paid our bills so have no money left but would love to have a family night with my kids. If anyone would help make this happen. I would gladly send pics of us enjoying this pizza or anything else you my like within reason. There is a hungry howies that delivers to our area.thanks so much for reading.
2517	True	a	The three of us are here at work at the campus computer repair desk. It's the end of the semester and we're all kind of hurting on cash, and it would be awesome to get a little pizza to share and make sure we aren't wasting an hour of $8/hour pay.  R_A_O_P is awesome, and we'd really appreciate it. I really hate asking for stuff like this, but pizza sounds delicious right now.  Thanks for considering us.  EDIT!!: http://imgur.com/YPcbf
2518	True	a	This is the state of my refrigerator: [Linky](http://i.imgur.com/JRvYJ5s.jpg)  I'll do my best to make someone else's week when I'm in a better state.  RAoP pls.  Edit(!!):  Thanks so much to /u/Felipe_O !!  I won't starve this week after all!!  Request fulfilled!!
2519	False	a	This week has been hell.  I've been depressed lately.  I've barely enough to pay rent this month.  School's just becoming a bit much right now.  We're almost out of groceries here at the apt, too.  I've not eaten much in the last two days.  It's driving me nuts...  I would be so grateful if someone could help out.     
2520	True	a	I had my hours cut at work from 40 to 24 a week. For this reason I am very broke right now, and going to move back in with my father in two weeks. I only have $4, and being Gluten Free I don't have many options with that much money (No options really). If someone could send a gluten free pizza my way, I would be very thankful, and purchase one for somebody on Friday when I get paid. If you are wondering how to get a gluten free pizza, Dominos does a great job with it. Not sure if Pizza Hut or anyone else does gluten free, but I trust Dominos. Please let me know if you are able to help me out today, I could really use some food! Thanks in advance!
2521	False	a	my recently ex boyfriend stole my purse from my apartment. seeing as i live paycheck to paycheck and i don't get paid for another week and a half, i have no way to pay for anything. i have nothing in the bank, and until i get new credit cards (i reported them stolen), i can't even buy groceries this week.   when i get paid, i can be sure to pay back/pay forward any kind of help anyone here could help me with. thanks for reading and thank all of you for what you do.  zoe
2522	True	a	Hey everyone, I graduated early on Monday but unfortunately about 3 hours before I was going to celebrate, my best friend called me saying her grandfather died and I've spent the last few days since then comforting her, making sure she doesn't focus on it, etc. This has lead to a lack of celebration and all I really want for graduating is a pizza. So if someone wants to help me celebrate, I'd really appreciate it.
2523	True	a	"So I'm financially a little shaky right now, as I don't start my new job until September and I just graduated. Anyway I was cycling around today and I was just setting off from the center of the city where I live when I spotted a Specialized bicycle with a flat tyre. Thinking of being the good samaritan, I decided to wait around and give this friend in need some much required assistance.      Shortly along comes his girlfriend, who sees me pushing on the tire (to check the pressure). She isn't aggressive or suchlike but she does go and get her boyfriend, who upon realisation of my motive is thankful for the assist. This is where it gets interesting - turns out this guy's ""friend"" had asked him for drug money, and when he had declined, the ""friend"" had slashed his tire with a knife - in fact, quite a large one. This friend was also sat across the street, well within viewing distance.  Naturally, I'm suddenly feeling a little less confident about this whole thing. Nonetheless, I grab my pump and toolkit saddlebag, and start whipping out the gear. We get the tire off just as another of this dude's ""friends"" comes over, and starts to be generally unhelpful and stand around in the way... whatever, I can still deal. His girlfriend also comes over, and they begin chatting about general shit. One topic that keeps coming up is how the gentleman I am in the midst of assisting is ""still on tag"" - which means they have been convicted of some kind of crime in the UK. Normally a tag also involves a curfew, and they are often handed out for violent crime. Nice. Turns out his mate is also ""on tag"". Nothing quite like roadside repair while surrounded by individuals with a penchant for violence should things not go their way.  By this point, we have patched the tube in two places and all seems well. On goes the tire, with the help of my handy tyre lever - or so we thought. The guy with the violent past is obviously not too much in control of his strength, as he snaps my tyre lever in half. Lovely. Just to top it all off, the guy's tire is still flat. Turns out two 1cm holes opposite each other on the tube just won't patch properly. Who'da thunk it? So anyway, ""thanks anyway""s are exchanged, and I begin the ride home - only to find that while leaving the site of my ad-hoc repairwork, I have a nice chunk of glass lodged in my own tire, and my tube is deflating with a deeply unwelcome hiss.  Defeated, I begin the long walk (push) to the nearest bike shop. Rather than treating myself to the takeaway I had been previously planning to devour, I find myself rather forlornly spending the money on a new tyre lever so that I can repair my own bicycle and actually make it home. Upon arrival I find myself faced with half a can of beans or something unidentifiable and frozen. While my need may not be so great as that of other Redditors, I hope at least that my story has been enjoyable. Thanks for reading to the end!  EDIT: TL;DR, I helped out a criminal repair what was probably a stolen bicycle while surrounded by sketchy people and subsequently had to spend my dinner money on a replacement tool he broke so that I could fix my own ride."
2524	False	a	I'm a history major, not looking for much just a pizza to cheer me up. My girlfriend broke up with me last night, and I'm not handling it well. Maybe pizza is the best cure for depression, because I am missing my girl. 
2525	False	a	Just moved to koreatown for a new job and am broke till next Friday and could use a hand getting an Easter meal. Thanks in advance to anyone who helps.
2526	False	a	I just switched to direct deposit and apparently it won't clear until after midnight tonight :(  My car broke down last week so I had to shell out a ton of money on it and was really counting on my pay to be here. I've never struggled to feed my daughter and I'm feeling awful and like a bad mother right now so I told my friend and she told me she'd help if she had the cash but recommended that I ask you guys. I've never really used reddit before but she swears I'm going to be addicted lol. Anyhow, I'll be on here for at least the next several hours while I'm at my desk, hoping for an answer! Here's a pic of me and my daughter : http://postimage.org/image/e4ux9nzet/  Edit: I'm in Dale City, Virginia. I know Domino's can do online orders so people from anywhere in the US can probably send, thanks so much!
2527	False	a	I'm completely in love with this subreddit, I think it is absolutely amazing that people are this nice to strangers! Had no idea reddit had such amazing people here! Any who, I'm a new mom, daddy works an hour away and long shifts. There is food in my house, I just can't find the time to make myself a decent meal while taking care of the baby. I do eat a ton of cereal lately haha, it's the easiest thing here.  Would love a pizza but I know there are a lot more people here that need it more than me. Regardless I still think what you guys do is great and would love to participate in the giving soon! 
2528	False	a	Fridge is empty (aside from useless condiments, cheese, salsa... and milk).  A pizza would be much appreciated. :)  **Edit:** Location: MN.
2529	False	a	Pm me if you'd like to help me celebrate passing finals! :)
2530	False	a	Title pretty much says it all, I realized today that I was in a unhealthy relationship with my girlfriend so I decided that I had had enough. While I know it was the right thing to do it still hurts and I dont really feel like cooking or doing too much. Thanks for taking the time to read this.
2531	False	a	My Girlfriend and I are down on our luck and getting desperate. I lost my job at the start of the summer and we've been floating by just barely managing to keep the rent covered. We've both been looking for jobs very actively, just haven't had any luck at all. We've got a bit of cash on the way next week, but no money until then. Not complaining about all that, but we haven't eaten in nearly three days and we're getting damn hungry. I'm more than happy to repay this favor in the future if someone would help us out tonight. 
2532	True	a	Posting here in hopes of pizza. Bit of a story!  Husband works CONSTANTLY to support us. right now I'm 23 weeks pregnant (see r/babybumps) and after moving back into our apartment due to MIL troubles we're broke til next payday. It's my fault that we're broke which is why I'm secretly posting here while husband is at work and cannot see it. Insurance refuses to cover my prenatal now for some reason so our spare food/gas money has gone to those.   I am out of work sadly (was collecting SSI for my disability but they cut it off as soon as I got pregnant and no one wants to hire a pregnant woman even for a temp :(  )  So just hoping for a meal for when husband comes home from work :(
2533	True	a	My son has recieved his meal, thanks veritas27!  My son is in dire need, I'm from Central California, a mother of 5, and cash is really tight here at home. My oldest child joined the Army in December of 09, he had just turned 19 then, however during his training at Ft. Benning he substained a back injury and was medically released from the service in Aug. 2010. It happen 2 weeks before his graduation he was on his last phase, I had bought my non refundable airline tickets a few days before that had happened. He came home and literally had to be on his back for 6 months, we didnt have the money nor insurance for him to get proper treatment, nor was there any offered to him by the Army, he toughed it out but he fell into deep depression.. by Feb. this year, he started training himself in shape, and began looking for any work, unfortunately nothing came up, that only lead to him feeling more depressed, having to see his dad work long hours at a very labor job to support all of us, he couldnt bare it and decided to take a chance in another state, hes in Portland, OR. right now, with his cousin, still trying to establish himself there, he's been there for about a month struggling, he just got a mailing address and now he can get an Oregon ID, right now he just haves his military ID, he doesnt except any cash from me, cause he says he rather it go to the babies (his little sisters 5 and 6) I worry about him eating constintly, instead i dried some cheap beef to jerky, and boxed some ramens to him. My son is struggling to get something started, I pray that something good will happen for him, and I think that something like this, would lift his spirits, that someone was thinking of him..
2534	False	a	Will give reddit gold for pizza! broke and hungry. Please help it's all I have to offer!
2535	False	a	Microwave is broken, have no sandwich supplies. Hope and Moral is running low.
2536	False	a	Most weeks I am really lucky to make it from paycheck to paycheck.  Usually I am broke by Thursday though.  This week is really bad, my mother has fallen on really bad times.  Mom got a foreclosure letter, myself and my sister stepped up and pulled together some money to keep mom in her house at least one more month.  Now I'm in trouble, I gave away all my food money and I haven't told my kids or my husband, I know I'm going to have to and I will but as of right now my kids are home from school and my husband will be home around 6:30 and I have no food and no money to get anything for dinner.  I promise that I will pay it forward next week if someone has it in their heart to help me out tonight.    Location, Kansas
2537	False	a	Spent the last of my money on bread for soup this morning. Won't be getting money until Monday when banks open so it could be a rough weekend and I have exams starting Monday. Any help appreciated, thanks guys.
2538	False	a	My girlfriend and I just moved into a new apartment after being homeless for a week and half. Our cubbords are empty and the week + of homelessness drained both our bank accounts. To top things off, I've contracted a flu like sickness and can't help around the new place much just quite yet. Some warm food would be greatly appreciated. 
2539	True	a	well it's my best friends birthday party at my apartment tonight and I'm too broke to get a pizza. this is worth a shot I suppose. Have a wonderful night everyone
2540	True	a	So I'm one of those people brought here by the recent media coverage.  I'm sorry if that makes me an outsider.  I've spent the last few days just reading through this site.  Both the pizza end of things and other areas.  I had no idea about reddit.  This Random Acts of Pizza is truly amazing to follow.  You laugh at the guy who's just bored and wants someone to send him a pizza, and you feel for the people that a pizza would be more than a pizza.  I've been hesitant to post because while I'm in a tough spot, it lacks in comparison to so many others.  I finally decided I'd just give it a try.  Worse case scenario, I don't get a pizza.  That's where I am anyway :)  I've been married for almost 10 years.  My wife and I have two beautiful children, a daughter 5, and a son 6.  When I met my wife, I was working crazy hours and didn't always have time for everything we wanted, but Friday night was always our date night.  It started purely by accident when she invited me over for pizza and a movie one night, and we've kept the tradition alive all these years.  We used to go out to the movies, and when that got too expensive, we enjoyed a movie at home.  When the kids got older, date night was expanded to family night.  Pizza and a movie for everyone.  We've gone through a lot of things in the last few years.  It's often felt like one step forward and two steps back.  We're still moving though.  Still fighting.  There came a point where pizza became a luxury, and it's something we've accepted and moved on.  I laugh when people talk about discretionary income.  We've learned to shave a lot of corners and given up a lot of things just to pay the bills.    Anyway, I guess my request is this.  I would love to, just for one night, be able to surprise the family with our pizza tradition.  They deserve it, and I wish I could give it to them.  I'm sure above me and below me are probably posts of people that need it more than we do, and I say give it to them.  If someone knows what it's like to be in this place and wants to help out, it would be much appreciated.  I look forward to the day I can come on here and make someone's day.  No promises of when I'll be able to do that, but I can promise it will happen, and I will be spreading the word about this and hope that more people will offer help to those who need it.  Thanks for listening, and sorry for the long post.  
2541	True	a	So, I mismanaged my money, broke until Friday.  I'd love a pizza for myself, my fiancee and my roommate.  I will gladly verify any and all info.  I also did receive from an awesome guy a couple of months ago.  Just want to be up front.  Thanks for reading!
2542	False	a	Hey everyone...I would be so honored if someone got me a pizza! I'm having a rough time right now. I'm a pre-med student and have a part-time job, but it's only giving me about 4-8 hours a week. By the time I pay my bills (which is pretty hard to do hehe), I have no money left over for groceries. A free pizza would be a lifesaver! Thanks in advance.
2543	True	a	"So I've fallen on some really hard times, and I've never done something like this, but after reading through some of the posts on here, I was taken aback at the kindness of the community, so I figured I'd give it a whirl.  I'm a 24 year old guy, living with two roommates that I absolutely loathe, unemployed for the past 5 months, busting my back looking for a job, and reaching the end of both my money and sanity.  I've been ""borrowing"" food from my roommates for a couple weeks now, but I hate having to go to them for anything, so I've been relegated to ramen and pickles.  If you've never tried them together, do yourself a favor and DON'T.  So, if someone had the urge and would be willing to help me out, if even for a day, I would be incredibly grateful and appreciative.  Thanks everyone"
2544	False	a	I just joined this site after hearing about it on the radio, and I love random acts of kindness (especially when food is involved) and was hoping to get into the circle. When I'm back home, I'm very happy to give a pizza to someone, but right now I'm not in the situation to do that.  We drove all the way from Washington, DC to Portland, OR and are heading to Seattle, WA soon. We're living off of chips and water. A warm pizza would be...awesome. Very awesome. If someone could help, I'd be super happy to have some real food after a week of nothing. Neither of us have any money to really buy more food.
2545	True	a	Welp, this week the Federal payment system mixed me up with someone who got half of his pay revoked this month.  The good news is that I get payed 150% next paycheck. The bad news is that I didn't know I was only 50% until I got notified by my bank yesterday. A Pizza from Dominoes would certainly help me cheer up and save the last bit of dough I have (pun intended) to make it to the end of the month.  If done, in July I will pay that shit forward!
2546	False	a	I got out of the Marine Corps several months ago. I am from Texas, and for the past few months I've been preparing to start college in Florida. The original plan was I would drive here to Florida, take a test, then return home and do my coursework online for the first 90 days, which would give me time to pull the funds together for the move to Florida. Unfortunately, they failed to inform me that the online option only applies to students who do exceptionally well on that test, which I did not. Just for the first trip, I had to sell something that was very important to me. Then I took the test and they told me I either had to give up my dream of becoming a student at their university, or move to Florida immediately. I returned to Texas and did everything I could think of to raise money for the early move, and in a final act of desperation, I sold even more of my belongings. Now I am in Florida, with 2 boxes of clothes, sleeping on a fellow classmate's (who also has no money) couch, with $2.00 in my wallet, wondering what I will do for food for the next 30 days, which is when my Veteran's Benefits kick in and I will finally be able to afford to eat. I would LOVE it and greatly appreciate it if some kind soul would buy me a pizza to enjoy tonight.
2547	False	a	I'm 15 weeks pregnant with my very first little munchkin and I am just going *nuts* for anything salty and savory. Unfortunately, my SO and I have committed to making all our food at home with whatever we have on hand (to save up for this baby of ours). None of the ingredients we have include pizza ingredients. But we *do* have an abundance of peanut butter, jelly, and bread which is the exact opposite of what I've been craving. We don't know if it's a girl or a boy yet (we know in 8 days!), but an old wives' tale says that if you're craving sweets it's a girl, but if you're craving salty things it's a boy :)
2548	True	a	Hello :)  My adorable puppy (pic - http://i.imgur.com/n8OC9.jpg ) and I kindly ask that someone please hook us up with a pizza today.  I'm broke, hungry, and I get paid tomorrow.    I will most certainly buy you or another redditor(your choice) a pizza tomorrow .  A pizza and a Dr. Pepper would totally rock my world, but a pizza alone would be just as wonderful.   In the time it has taken me to write this post, she's become much more demanding: http://i.imgur.com/2pY2v.jpg &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;   Please save me from her wrath and send us a Pizza! I solemnly promise to return the favor tomorrow :)  Edit: I'll also be happy to send/post pics of the pizza and us enjoying it :D  Update: I got a pizza, thanks to IdTugYourBoat ! -&gt; thank you thread http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/p8pmq/received_thank_you_so_much_idtugyourboat_for_the/
2549	False	a	The NHL is back! When I get out of work tomorrow I'm looking forward to relaxing and watch as much hockey as I can. A pizza from the Pizza Hut right by my house would be an added plus. I've given before on another account. http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/iouna/request_im_broke_sick_recently_single_and_hungry/ Go Wings and Broncos! Edit: just realized it's my cake day. So much karma wasted.

2552	False	a	Hey. I recently had my hours cut back at work, and have been struggling to find a second job to make up for the lost wages. I've had to cut down on my food budget in order to pay my bills, and have been eating nothing but ramen for the past month. I only have a few left, and I'm now out of money until Friday. Would be amazing if I could actually eat a real meal for once. Thanks a lot.
2553	False	a	Chillin in Alaska, really craving a pizza. No story, just wishing I could have a full stomach of pizza. By all means, choose the guy above me, or below me. Doesnt really phase me otherwise. I'll probably forget about this anyways :)
2554	False	a	"hi, so i'm new at this, i was told by a friend that this site could help me, basically i'm a student in england, living with 3 other guys (well was suppose to be) we made the down payments all the pre-payed bills and what not then 1 guy pulls out this has made me and my friend very skint, as we're picking up his third of the payments and now i've heard my ""friend"" is thinking of pulling a fast one on me trying to get out of this contract as well! - so, here i am, a poor, frustrated student who has lost trust in his friends and is struggling to put food on the table, anyone going to help a brother out?   i'm not begging, i'm new at this, reading some of the stuff on this page has given me some hope that their are more humans with hearts on this planet then i think."
2555	True	a	I've got two exams tomorrow and only tapioca pudding in the house.  I'm stuck at my desk writing out op-amp circuits trying to make sense of it all.  I'm craving a pizza hardcore.  Help a lady out?  I definitely will be paying it back when I am not stressed out of my mind!      Edit: crappy webcam proof of [starving clueless college girl](http://i.imgur.com/IsFpk.jpg).

2556	False	a	It's my 22nd birthday today. Last night I moved into a place with my friend and we don't have much to celebrate with. Help make my birthday a little less lame, please.   Also, my fiance is 29 weeks pregnant and craving pizza.   There is a Pizza Hut within walking distance so we can pick up. Anything would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks for your time!
2557	False	a	So yeah I flew in on the 17th and am out of the processed food I bought from Sainsburys. Money has not come in and I have popcorn left for dinner. Student life is hard and sad :(
2558	False	a	So, my husband and I decided to get separated on Saturday. It's amicable, but still incredibly sad. On top of that, I am ill in bed with the worst cold I've had in years and have been basically drifting in and out of sleep for the last 24 hours, with brief breaks for a drink warm water. I don't have any energy to cook.  I can't say I'm desperate for a pie, but having one delivered to my door would be absolutely awesome. Thanks! 
2559	False	a	Hey, recently found out my mom has breast cancer and have been having to help family out with paying for that, which has really depleted my funds. To make things worse, I just found out that I am being laid off at the end of the week. Would really appreciate pizza if someone will oblige.
2560	False	a	Request: I am trying to have a party tonight because my mom and sister are out of town. I am just a broke college student and I'm being honest I want pizza. I am not a sob story... I have a pretty easy going life and love pizza!
2561	True	a	I just finished my last two finals today and have nothing to do until graduation. In one of my last acts of being a broke college kid, I would love to spend the rest of my night with a pizza and some old school video games. It would be greatly appreciated!
2562	False	a	So, Here is the story, it starts on Thursday 22nd February 2012. I have had a hectic month and have all but run out of money, by the time i realised i wasn't getting paid till the 1st i had maybe 3 or 4 pounds left in my account. Now i am already a student...a student who pays his own rent, and even with the maintainance loan and overdraft find myself on the poor end of the stick a lot. Now i as i am sure you are, am a lover of a good pizza.    But with only 4 pounds i resigned myself to having to wait till the 1st. So for one week i lived on the 11p noodles at tescos, 3 meals a day of 11p noodles, With the promise of a pizza on the 1st though, my mind was battling through. 28th of Feb and low and behold it is a leap year this year....ok i say, that's fine, one more day, few more noodles i can deal,  I've come this far already.    The first hits, and the thought of my pizza is incredible, my mouth is watering at the idea as i get out of bed. And the first thing i do is go to check my balance and pay my rent....Oh what's that? yes. My bank details were stolen? Virus on my computer? Now not only is the idea of my pizza gone, but the fear of being unable to pay my rent is gripping me tightly, i call the bank immiediately, and have my accounts frozen and my cards cancelled. it's evening seeing as i have a bad sleeping pattern and probably only woke up at around 5pm. i cannot make it to a bank today to check my balance, and with no cards, i definately cannot buy a pizza :( But tomorrow i tell myself. Tomorrow.   i head in the next day and check my balance the money is there, Phew, i take out enough money for my rent and be on my way. Oh no you cry, where is the money for my pizza. Well i forgot about that. and manage to fall asleep at about 5am that night waking up for bank closing on saturday. Great. Tomorrow is sunday. No pizza then either, And if my card doesn't arrive tomorrow i may have to wait even longer for my pizza. So i call out to you. To all you Pizza samaritans. Help me. In my hour of need, I call upon you reddit.
2563	True	a	Pretty much what's in the title. Help is greatly appreciated.  -Max  **EDIT: Got some groceries, I'm good now. Thanks anyways, guys!**
2564	False	a	I would love a pizza right now.  I don't need it; there's no sad story to my life that would make a pizza truly beneficial right now; I just feel like eating pizza.  I understand if no one wants to buy me one, but I would greatly appreciate it.  If you want, I could photoshop your name to look cool or something like that.  This is my first time asking for pizza, so if you have any kind of request in return, such as a wallpaper, I will gladly oblige.
2565	False	a	I have been suffering from pretty bad depression and social anxiety over the past 6 months. Ended up dropping out of my last semester of university and quit my job during this time. I just maxed out my credit card on a new prescription, and I am out of even credit now. The bottom line is I have no money to buy any food right now and only have a few cans of beans left. I would love to have a nice hot pizza to get me through the next few days. I am hoping this newest prescription works how it should and I am able to get out and find a job because I would love to play it forward and help out a fellow Redditor in need. I verified my email and also have another account which has a bunch of karma, I just have a few friends on that account and would be too embarrassed for them to find out about my current situation. Thanks in advance for anyone that has taken the time to read this and hope someone can help out.   Some of the local pizza places are Pizza Pizza, Ginos Pizza, Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza. Pizza Pizza being the closest. 
2566	False	a	A combination of switching jobs and subsequent pay period lag, medical, and other unexpected bills have left finances tight until Tuesday. Pizza for the wife &amp; 2 kids would be an awesome stress relief pick-me-up. If someone would be so kind as to pizza us today, I'll pay it forward x2 when my check clears to two other requests in need of some hot cheesy goodness!
2567	True	a	Been subsisting on friends generosity and a bag of rice and beans that is shrinking quickly. Hoping someone might be able to help me out. The last three days have been tapatio/rice/beans, twice a day and I feel like I'm starting to lose my mind!
2568	False	a	My birthday is in two days and I don't usually celebrate it. But, I would enjoy a pizza for my birthday.  I don't *need* this. I have money, but I would enjoy this gift since I won't receive any other gifts for my birthday.  Thanks!
2569	False	a	Me and a friend are in need of food real quick, we got like 0 bucks to our name. Stomach starting to hurt, so hungry :( need pizza if anybody is nice enough, anybody in tucson wanna be generous :)
2570	False	a	Girlfriend of 9 months just broke up with me, turns out she slept with a guy after a night out 2 weeks ago. Had a feeling she had as everything was different (No intimacy etc) and today she told me on the phone, she leaves for Thailand tomorrow (She's an English teacher going out there for a year)  I live with my parents and they've all gone to another family members 21st birthday, didn't really feel like going but now I massively regret it, just sat here in the house with no one to talk to/vent except our mangy old cat.  Would really appreciate something to smile about. 
2571	False	a	We are so desperate for food, we have tried on 3 seperate accounts to obtain a pizza. Now look into your heart, and please make the right decision. We arent trying to be greedy. Just honestly hungry, And mean, its fucking snowing outside.. Isn't that bad enough. :(
2572	False	a	Hi!  First time requesting pizza.  My husband and I are in between pay periods and a surprise (but I guess not too surprise) car insurance bill zapped us of literally all of our money.  We have only bread and butter as meal substitutes until payday (this Thursday), we just wiped out the last of the dried beans.  So a pizza would be like, the best treat for our bellies.  Thank you so much! Poutina + Poutina's Husband  Edit:  Whoops!  We are in South Jersey and EST zone.
2573	False	a	With midterms coming up I'm cooped up in my room studying for business law and only have a few bucks to my name after paying rent. A pizza sounds phenomenal.  
2574	True	a	My dad has been battling problems both with money and with alcoholism, and when I tried to mention it to him, he misconstrued it and went somewhat berserk. I left home the next day (yesterday) and returned to Chicago several days before the dorms reopen. One of my friends was gracious enough to let me stay in her apartment, but I feel really guilty about both using her utilities and stealing her food.  I was just wondering if anyone would be kind enough to lend me a pizza that I can spread out over the next couple days. I went job hunting today and plan to spend the rest of the evening filling out applications, so I promise that I will return the favor as soon as I have enough money. Thank you!
2575	False	a	I've been near broke since late May and for the past 2 weeks I've been scraping by on my loose change while I wait for the first paycheck from a new job. I was told I would be receiving direct deposit by midnight of last night and I woke up this morning to... nothing. Lately I've been eating rice, .50 loaves of day old Jimmy Johns bread, and $2 lunch specials from this really great Thai restaurant nearby. But those can get pretty tiring after repetition.    I have just enough change to take the CTA to and from work for today and tomorrow and if don't get my money by then, well fuck, that's my own problem. I have $5.90 left in my bank account, which I'm keeping there as a kind of emergency buffer. Here's screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/w1Rs7.png  Anyone there able to help a hungry redditor out?
2576	False	a	Alternatively, I will write a poetic song about you and a hobby of yours and write music for it!
2577	False	a	I just moved in to my new place (loving it!) last night. I'm in a bit of a bind since I was previously living in a mix of hotels/couches, and don't have anything to cook with, just my clothing and a few other necessities for now. All the money I had saved up went to my rent and security deposit. I get paid on Monday but until then the food situation is looking a bit grim. I send my thanks in advance to anyone who'd like to help me get through the next day with the cheesy goodness of pizza!
2578	False	a	My birthday is on tuesday the 27 and man some pizza would be so good!!!
2579	False	a	"Greetings!  My parents are in the process of moving into their new home after being homeless for about a month. There have been a lot of really frustrating and stressful developments over the past nine months leading to my parents moving into this new home. I've taken most of this week off of work to come and help with this transition.  Unfortunately, after I arrived I learned that they have delayed the actual move-in days because the previous owner was a ""crazy cat lady"" and the house still reeks of urine. (There are visible signs of spraying in some of the rooms.)  I have learned that over the weekend my mother spent most of her time shampooing, and re-shampooing all of the rooms. Today my father and I spent most of the day addressing  and then moving in the heavy furniture and furnishings. Hopefully if all went well with the previous cleanings, we'll be able to start moving the majority of items into the home. (Unless it is decided that the carpeting will need to be replaced first.)  Anyway, long story short, it would be fantastic if we could have pizza for dinner tomorrow (Tuesday) night. I'm not financially able to supply any food while I'm staying here, and I was hoping that maybe someone would be willing to help us out.  Thanks!"
2580	False	a	 I've been unemployed for a year and 2 months. Due to being unemployd, I've been living with my fiance's parents. It's been a long, hard road what with money issues and studying for my degree, but I was finally offered a part time job which is set to start on Feb. 28th.    I'd love to get a pizza to celebrate the good news and the start of a new chapter with the people who've graciously opened their home to me and helped me out this long.    As soon as I get my first paycheck, I'm buying a fellow reddior some pizza!         I'm located in PR.   Thanks for existing RAoP, you guys are amazing, I love seeing how generous people can be.
2581	False	a	I'll spare you the hard luck story; I'm sure you've heard it before. My partner and I have been battling the economy for a couple of years now. We've been blessed with a place to live and been able to keep the electricity and the tubes, but food has been scant and invariably cooked by me. A pizza would be a goddess-send. We're in the SF Bay Area, CA. I know I'm a new account; I would be happy to provide proof that I'm a real person.
2582	False	a	Me and my husband are college students at Texas Lutheran University. We don't get paid until tomorrow and are starving. We would pawn something however we have already pawned our engagement rings and have nothing else of value. Would be awesome if we could get a little bit of help
2583	True	a	Not sure if this is the purpose of this reddit. Please excuse the new account, I saw this on the news, what an amazing idea!  I am currently living with a roommate who has just moved out of her mother's house, she has no job and her mother sends her utility and rent money. Her only responsibility is to send her mom the rent bill, and she sends half of that or pays half to the company. The problem is that this girl is SO lazy, can't be bothered to send the bills, can't be bothered to call her mom for rent and I'm under the impression she told her mom she already had a job (her mom has been chiding her for not having a job), so her mother does not feel obligated to pay this girl's bills. I have been carrying the weight of the major bills, such as electricity and rent (2x), and my paycheck is being stretched thin. To top it off, it's obvious to see where she gets her flaky attitude from...her mother REFUSES to answer my phone calls or emails. So here I am reddit, living with a girl who labels her food in the fridge so I don't touch it, and for the sake of keeping the peace...I am down to begging for a pizza X(.  I would prefer giftcards, because I would rather give out my email address than my physical address, but I will understand those who dont want to in case they believe I am a scammer.   My email address is: Jen.Beam.1984@gmail.com
2584	False	a	I saw Random Acts Of Pizza on ABC news, and I have been lurking all day reading about all of the wonderful things this reddit has done. I just signed up today to be apart of this, and sad to say the first thing i will be doing is requesting. I haven't ate anything but a bagel in the last 3 days, and my paycheck comes in on friday, I am so hungry so if anyone would please help me out i will be sure to buy a pizza for someone in need when my check comes in  thank you reddit for listening
2585	False	a	Hey guys, after a long week at work I could really use a pizza. I had to get my car fixed this week and it ate up all my monies except for enough to get to work for the next week. I know there probably isn't many Australians on here but it's worth a try. Worst thing about being broke? Missing Nirvana Live at the Paramount at the cinema for its only screening to mark the 20th anniversary of Nevermind.
2586	True	a	hello, i tried last night but didnt get one ): im still roomateless and surrounded by ravioli that makes me ill and havent eaten all day. i do have a verification code, and would LOVE a pizza(hopefully it will last me until tomorrow too!). like i said last night i will pay it forward when i have the money! someone please help! 
2587	False	a	"I figure, what better subreddit to show my family than the awesomeness of r/random_acts_of_pizza ? I'll draw something if necessary, write you a ""thanks for the pizza"" song, whatever! Show some love?"
2588	False	a	Ok so today is his birthday and we have no money to throw him a party or celebrate it. I am 17 and he just turned 21!!! We live with my dad but unfortunately he doesn't have any money either. I would really appreciate it if someone would gift him a pizza and I'm sure he would be delighted. Thanks for taking the tome to read this and if you decide to help me out then I will be grateful. I have no proof unless you want to add him on facebook. I live in Sugarland, Texas
2589	True	a	So a fellow redditor kept me company last night when I was stricken with stress induced insomnia. I never made it to sleep and had to be at work at 7:30. Spent 2 hours this afternoon in the Department of Social Services office trying to see if I qualified for any assistance. Tomorrow I will go on the 30 day processing list for SNAP, they accepted a medicaid application for me and my daughter, and put me on the 2 year waiting list for daycare assistance. I picked her up from daycare and brought her home to give her a bath and as we were filling up the tub I noticed it looked dirty. Then it looked really dirty and red. I stopped the water and got her out of the tub and checked all of our faucets. All had icky brownish red water coming out of them. Needless to say, I'm not cooking tonight and am waiting for the utility company to call me back. Would anyone like to send a pizza to Wilmington, NC to cheer up my 4 year old who thought she took a bath in blood?  Edit: Picture of gratitude http://i.imgur.com/D0gt4.jpg
2590	False	a	Details: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hwx1t/i_have_084_500g_of_rice_4_cups_of_flour_50g_of/  That is all I have for the next 11 Days.   Any help appreciated.  I am in New Zealand, unfortunately. In the Wellington area.
2591	False	a	Some background information.  I just graduated college in June 2012.  I just accepted a job offer for an awesome position but the job has not started yet and I have been living a very limited budget for some time now.  I can offer a picture of us in return and also I also enjoy a healthy conversation with new people.  Went to college in NYC, will be working in Mortgage backed securities and modeling prepayment.
2592	False	a	~~Not getting paid for a commission is the pits and I was hoping it would be my food moneys. I'm not very good, but maybe someone out there wants a scribble done for them?~~  [4 a.m. doodle](http://i.imgur.com/nJBSCZq.jpg?2) [Some Dotas](http://24.media.tumblr.com/aed5a48c3ed93e43c8c088bb6c173ade/tumblr_mro5ecPNfw1qdkylpo3_250.jpg)  ~~Edit: Oh, duh.

2593	True	a	I'm just your average everyday dude, but lately I've been having a little crave for a goood pizza. If you could please grant me my request mankind, I'll forever be in your debt and sill surely lend a hand before thought! :D
2594	True	a	Not trying to make up some sob story. Just an honest person trying to stay fed. If you could help out Id love to give back when I can. Verfication will be provided. Can do pictures of our food stores if you want!  Edit 1: Food Storage http://i.imgur.com/YveN5.jpg  Edit 2: Got the Pizza Thanks again!!! http://i.imgur.com/hlFxn.jpg
2595	False	a	My Birthday is on November 4th and I am putting this request in early because I am bored and hopefully some kind soul will see it in the next month or so. I broke my leg last Monday and I am willing to provide all the proof necessary. Free Pizza would really float my gondola.  
2596	False	a	I do freelance work online, but it isn't nearly enough to cover the bills. I rely on a local food bank (diabetes makes this difficult), and the assistance of my family. I'm looking for reliable work, but I live in a small town and I don't own a car; it makes things somewhat difficult. I've lived off of water and rice mixes for the last eight days, and could really go for a small pepperoni pizza. Nothing fancy; I'm a die-hard pepperoni fan.  Please message me, if you're feeling generous. There's a Papa Johns and a Pizza Hut within delivery distance, and a couple of Mom &amp; Pop places within a short walking distance.
2597	False	a	I'd love a bite of food right now, outta money since I paid for Spring fees. Thank you! 2 polisci finals, one history one, one bio one...and a polisci paper.
2598	False	a	Hey, I just moved into my first apartment and am a little short on cash until next week. Would love some pizza, don't care where it comes from.
2599	False	a	Long story short: I lost my wallet a week ago, which had my debit card/ID/etc. So even though I have enough in my account to get a value meal from mcdonalds, I'm shit out of luck. Plus, pizza is way way better. :D. Thanks for your time and consideration.
2600	False	a	Hey RAoP!    We just downloaded the installation for Final Fantasy XIV and we didn't really plan on the process taking so long.  Time flew by, and now we're stuck here, hungry and unable to play the game! Wife is preggo and craving some pizza! Help us! =D  Thanks!!!
2601	True	a	Hey guys I've been without stable income for a couple months now and have eaten nothing but ramen for 2 weeks. Any money I end up scraping together goes to my rent so I'm not couch surfing. I was just wondering if anyone would be able to help me out here. Ramen is ok but it makes me want to hurl after a while. Here is my bank account http://imgur.com/WW08gM5  I don't know if ill be able to provide anyone with any in the near future but if someone could help me out that would be great and if not that is fine to. Thank you for your time.
2602	False	a	I have no other reasons i am just hungry and have no food and no shops nearby to walk to. I will be sooo happy and grateful for someone to order me a pizza. :) Im from Buckinghamshire
2603	False	a	I've been struggling financially since I got out of school and so long story short, I don't get to eat as often as I probably should and someone I know pointed me to this page. It'd be lovely and much appreciated if someone could help me out with a pizza tonight.   Thanks (:
2604	True	a	hey there, first time poster, long time lurker (: i recentlly broke my shoulder, and was told i had to take off work for a while. because of this i have no money coming in; i am broke and quickly running out of food, please help! http://imgur.com/pmafe &lt;-- me p.s. im currently living in the windy city!! (chicago il)
2605	False	a	Have a few hours to kill before I walk to work for the night. Its kinda far but mostly I just like pizza. Whatever I dont eat will stay at the house for my friend to eat when he gets home. Its his house and all. Have questions let me know.
2606	True	a	Hi RAOP  I had to scrounge up what ever money I could find so I could get my dogs some dog food today. They ran out of dog food yesterday. The fridge is empty and I wont be getting any money till Tuesday. Can someone help out a guy and his two dogs? I'll share some with my dogs. I' sure they would love a slice, instead of eating that cheap dried stuff.
2607	False	a	drugs. i fucked up, and will probably be punished for the rest of my employable life.   EDIT 8/1/12: [help a brother](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXxOU49TVKA) enjoy a few little things.  edit 8/2/12: ;/
2608	True	a	I'm off work today and have no money to cookout.A pizza would be a generous offer from a nice redditor.
2609	True	a	I have been looking for a job for about 3 months now and FINALLY! got the tap from the local UPS depot for a drivers job! Not the most glamorous job i know but hey for this area the money is decent and the station is close to home so no complaints from me! Paying it forward it specifically implied upon first full paycheck.   Also if i get the job i promise not to be one of those jerk delivery guys that punts your nice box of Newegg goodness to the front door of your place from out by the curb!  :D  Any fine human being out there feel inclined to send out a good luck pizza to a prospective package jockey?  Now that i think of it that didn't sound so good.. 
2610	False	a	I never thought it would come to this but I'm trying my luck.  I told my parents about 2 weeks ago that I enlisted for drama school next year instead of finding a job with my masters in communication science that I'm graduating end of this semester.   They promptly threw me out of the house and told me I could go do street theater if I ever needed money. I would if it wasn't -2¬∞ out. 4 years ago they told me the same about communication, except they told me if I need money I could go write about lost cats in the local paper.   Been out of money for 10 days now and my parents and sister are not picking up their phones, so they seem pretty serious about it. But I'm set on doing this.   I'll be getting a paycheck in about a week but I'm out of rice and pasta. I'd be enormously grateful and would do anything for a pizza right now.   [I see there's an international ordering guide in the sidebar.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ns3dj/the_definitive_guide_to_ordering_internationally/) I'd be more than willing to guide you through the process of ordering, which should be fine with a credit card. You'd be ordering from www.just-eat.be which has always been reliable and is always a safe bet for the student population here.  I'm counting on your random act of kindness to not let me go to bed hungry two nights in a row.  Thank you and my apologies for the tearjerking. My parents will turn around soon, so it'll be fine.
2611	False	a	So, I am 20 years old and for the past two months due to a fight with me and mom, (she didn't wanna fill out my fasfa form so i can get a grant for college), I have been homeless. I don't drive, and I didn't have a job for a while I just recently started working part time at a buffet I don't get paid for another two weeks. I make it day by day with help from my friends, I don't know where I am going to sleep every night, or how I am going to eat. And most of the time I will go without food, But a friend of mine told me about random acts of pizza and how they help people in situations like mine. So, it would help me a lot if someone can help me eat for the week. I don't like asking for things, and I feel dumb because I am asking for food. But its to the point where I don't have very many options. Thanks, &lt;3 Mercedes.
2612	False	a	We walk thru the woods in search of werewolves.  We walk thru the woods at night.  We aren't afraid of them at all,  unless they try to bite!  Alas our pockets be empty And we're quite in need of a munch But if you'd send us a pizza, We'll gladly eat it for lunch!  (Thanks for your consideration, any pizza store would do)
2613	True	a	None of the big 3 deliver here...  sorry.  I'm not going to post some sob story about why I would like some food, just that I'm hungry and tired.  If someone could order from a local place I'll give the number and my address or what not.  It would be appreciated. 
2614	False	a	A redditor friend of mine told me about this sub-reddit. I don't have anything to eat tonight, no gas, and $2 to my name. I would really appreciate it if someone could help me out. I promise to repay either in another pizza donation, or in cash as soon as I get some. Thanks.
2615	False	a	"So, in light of the article that has been floating around here, I feel kind of timid about putting this out there, but I guess I have nothing to lose at this point. In the past, he has searched my reddit history and scolded me for things I posted, etc., but I know that a throwaway won't be acknowledged, so I guess I'll take my chances on him getting mad about this.  I've been in an emotionally abusive relationship for quite some time, and it has been absolutely wrecking my sense of self/sanity.   This weekend, we were supposed to go to his family's cabin, and over the course of the week there were many , ""well, I'm going alone!"" and ""I want you to come with, baby"" moments.  That is probably the tamest and most concise way to tell the story.  Last night, he was shining a flashlight repeatedly, directly in my eyes, to try and make me go to bed with him, if that gives any insight.  I am proud of myself for deciding not to go with him this weekend, even if we were on a ""high"" this afternoon.   I am moving out the first of August, and am trying desperately to save money for my security deposit/first month's rent. To be honest, I was looking forward to free meals with his family, but I decided it wasn't worth it.  The icing on the cake is that I'm one of those people who doesn't eat when they're stressed out, so right now it's just me, a box of wine, and whatever I ate yesterday hanging out in the house.  Logic tells me I should eat.   Anyone?  I would absolutely love to pay it forward when I have my feet on the ground. "
2616	False	a	This is for me &amp; the wife. I'll pass (play?) it forward on payday (20/9) too. Thanks for swinging by.
2617	True	a	Title pretty much says all. Tired of only eating ramen. I would be very grateful if someone could help :)   Verification is ready!  Edit: I'm from New Mexico
2618	False	a	We came to Anaheim for the Vex 2013 World robotics competition. Now we are back at the place we are staying and looking to eat some pizza.  Thanks in advance.  
2619	True	a	I haven't eaten anything in about 24 hours due to what I think was food poisoning. I'm better now and am enjoying non-sick life once again.
2620	False	a	Hey guys,  I've made my way in to uni at 8:30pm to work on assignments and get ahead in general. I came straight from a netball game to here, so haven't eaten a thing since lunch.  To explain the title, I am absolutely and completely broke in terms of both spirit and cash. The year started off with my girlfriend of 4 years breaking up with me and having to move out, which sunk me into a state of depression.  I was working full time, but had plans in place to go back to uni and leave my job. My annual leave payout was going to cover my credit card debts, and I was to rely on welfare + a part time job to cover rent, bills, petrol, etc. The annual leave payout was a lot less than I anticipated, as I was taxed a lot, meaning I could only pay off one credit card, and the rest paid my rent in advance for a couple of weeks to make sure there were no issues there. Centerlink have screwed me around, and have told me I may potentially be waiting six months before they start paying me. I've been looking, but struggling, to find part time work. I made $100 last week for fixing a family members computer, and I put in about 15 hours of work to earn that money, but haven't seen any more since.   My car rego is now overdue, I have two months of unpaid phone bills that need to be paid, when I run out of petrol (I have about half a tank at the moment) I have no idea how I'm going to get to and from uni, and I have absolutely no idea where the money for my car payment and insurance is going to come from on Friday. Not to mention the required payments for my other two credit cards, which I'm now starting to get payment reminders for.  The reason I'm struggling with uni is that because of the depression, I'm also suffering from anxiety, and it has been a real struggle to get myself to uni. I've been stressing about where the money is going to come from to cover all my bills, and what I'm going to do when I need to start making rent payments again. Not to mention being out dealing with centerlink and desperately looking for work.  Please help a fellow redditor in need out and sort me out with a pizza to help me get through the night. When a source of income comes in, I am more than happy to return the favour. When I do have money, I try to regularly made it a habit to help people out. I'm also happy to fulfil requests, but bear in mind that I'm at uni.  Thanks in advance =) 
2621	False	a	I get paid on friday but until then am poor. More than happy to pay it forward at that point, but could use some help right now. I'm located 1hr north of Seattle.
2622	False	a	Hey guys. Just got a new job recently and I'm waiting for my first full pay. My partial pay last week went to rent and I'm a week till I have my first no-strings attached pay. I plan on paying it forward at that point - any chance someone can help me out with a bit of food before then?
2623	False	a	What's up ROAP? Two twenty-something dudes from NH and MA trying to get down on some pizza tonight and watch a movie or two, but we're both dead broke from rent and car payments :( A Random Act of Pizza would be HEAVENLY! 
2624	True	a	Starving writer, here  located in Savannah  just recently moved;  *   Myself and husband  both working but no money  nothing in the fridge.  *  We have much love, still  it's hard to eat out your heart  or something like that.  *  If you pizza me  I will thank you in haiku  customized for you  *  And, when things improve  I will pay it forward, too:  Zen pizza haiku!  
2625	False	a	I am in Lubbock TX.  Anyone willing to help a guy out?  I will repay the kindness this week
2626	True	a	I'm nearly out of money and I'm running out of time. I lost my job in January and need pizza soon or else my New Year's resolution is a bust. I DO have a job interview tonight at 7:30 p.m. (EST) and it'd be nice not to go on an empty stomach. Reddit, could you kill two of my birds with one stone by ordering me a pizza so I can eat lunch AND dinner?!
2627	False	a	 Moved to New York recently and the city really is as expensive as everyone says it is. I ran out of cash till Friday and kind of hungry. Just found out about this subreddit and I'd be eternally grateful for anything someone can throw my way. I promise to pay it forward when my payday comes along.  Thank you 
2628	False	a	My car broke down on Saturday, and then my bike chain snapped today.   I am very frustrated and tired from my full day of watching little children/walking home in the Memphis heat with a broken bike in tow.  I would love a pizza to help fuel my DIY bike repair.   Thanks.  I promise to use a part of my next paycheck to purchase a pizza for a needy redditor.   
2629	True	a	Living in SD, USA. Money is really tight with my fiance and I and while we have cheap boxed dinner food it would be much appreciated to be able to offer her something more substantial to eat since she's 7 months pregnant. If anybody is feeling generous we would be eternally thankful!   EDIT: Fulfilled by pizzamom thank you so much!
2630	True	a	"Howdy RAOP! I've been in a giant funk lately that I've been unable to pull myself out of, then then tonight my son surprised me. He wrote me a little note saying that I should play Xbox with him and take my ""mind off of things,"" along with other sweet things.   We played for about 2 hours while he asked me questions about when I was in 3rd grade and joked around about Space Chimps. It was the funnest time I've had in a long time and really reminded me about what's important.   I don't have access to my account until Monday night since the fiance has my card on a trip for a class for work. I have stuff for the weekend but it's all meals that my son doesn't really enjoy that much. Since neither of us will go hungry this weekend I will completely understand if you would rather give to someone who needs it more than myself, but I would love to treat my ""punkin"" for everything he did for me tomorrow sometime. Taking a pizza to the park is one of his favorite things.  I will be making offers next week, whether or not I get a pizza so even if you're just reading this and you're hungry be sure to check back with me then. :)   I think it's time for a great nights sleep now but I will check back tomorrow!"
2631	False	a	It's payday. Money is in the bank. My old card was lost and I'm waiting on a replacement. Unfortunately It's kind of hard to buy pizza with a checking account. Someone mind hooking me up and I'll pass it on once the card comes in?
2632	False	a	"One of my classmates (Graduate of a high school in 2011) had a terrible motorcycle accident. He was in a coma for the first couple of days, then he came out but the doctors had to put him back into one (Self induced coma) in order to maintain his levels of stability for surgery. He is still in critical condition and I am hosting a benefit concert with my band for his family. They lost their mother when they were young (Elementary school) and Ethan (The boy who was hurt) has a twin brother. I've known them almost all of my life and am putting this concert together almost single handedly.   I'm hoping to give pizza to the folks that are working at the concert and the bands playing. If I get enough, I'll even sell it for just $1 a slice at the concert for extra benefit money for his family!   Here is the link to the concert information for those of you wanting to just send your support.- https://www.facebook.com/events/164208037116711/?ref_newsfeed_story_type=regular  The pizza place (Shaker's) does not deliver so I will have to pick it up. You can order it for September the 28th from 1pm-6pm. You can possibly even preorder it! But if you do decide to order, order it under the name of ""Steeple"". That's how I'll pick it up. Thank you so much for those of you who send support and those who order! It means a lot. I've been so busy with this concert.   The pizza place's number is (731)-663-2700.  EDIT: Also, please let me know if you order and for what time. "
2633	True	a	no money no food and hungry  a pizza would e nice =[
2634	True	a	The pilot, my partner, and I had to make a quick landing after one of our sensors started acting up. Luckily we didn't have a patient with us. We're grounded at a small airport and were about to order some pizza. Thought I'd see if a random pizza flew our way. Thanks. 
2635	False	a	Firstly thanks RAOP for existing. I love reading other people's pizza'd experience.   I started a new job as a baker for Stop n Shop after not having a steady one for the past three years. I absolutely love working due to my natural high energy level, so it's awesome! However my body is adjusting to the activity level which is one of the highest in my life - I also dance daily since I found rhythmic movement is necessary for me to regulate my emotions and impulses. However since I'm broke due to screwing up my landlady's dirt patch and rent being due, I'm on the beans/ramen/seitan diet which I don't actually mind at all except I dropped six pounds in the past week and every muscle in my body hurts in a new way. I can't afford used clothes from the thrift store anytime this month unless I get birthday money, can't afford to take the bus home, and I don't get paid til Thursday.   The pizza wouldn't just be for me. Fortunately I live with two wonderful supportive lovers (closed poly triad). My bf helped me out giving me a lift home a couple times because cars beep at me and people yell stuff while walk home from work exhausted :( Our gf is in chronic pain and feeling depressed due to trying to be a bio major after going through two windshields and injuring her ankle BAD on the job when I met her. I would love to cheer her up with cheesy goodness, since they are also broke.  Thanks RAOP!
2636	False	a	TL;DR  I lost my wife because she cheated on me with 3 of my cousins. She got custody of my son. Her lawyer fucked me in the ass and now I am about to bankrupt.  *Throwaway account
2637	True	a	My girlfriend and I will be broke for the next few weeks. She has a ticket to pay off, and I have to pay 1200 dollars to have my cars engine fixed (I blew 2 cylinders). After paying for this, we're essentially broke until out next payday. Just asking for a pizza for dinner tonight.Anything would be greatly appreciated.
2638	False	a	So I started working at a small law firm and I haven't been paid since I started at the beginning of January. I am running low on funds after traveling across Texas (Lubbock to Austin to College Station to Kingwood and back to Lubbock) for an interview and to support my brother's pregnant girlfriend after she received some scary news. Would love to have a pie when I get home tonight. I promise to pay it forward when I can.
2639	True	a	Hey, doods! I'm currently a rising sophomore studying for midterms coming up, hopefully some pizza could relieve some stress..., and some hunger. I would appreciate the help and return the offer someday when I get my paycheck.  Thank you!
2640	True	a	We're completely broke and craving pizza. I thought I was super smart and ordered Domino's gift cards on Walmart.com with my Paypal - they aren't going to be e-delivered until tomorrow! Payday is Friday, and we don't have any money for groceries until then... but I will reciprocate! I will also send a homemade candle if someone wants... if you're kind enough to feed hubs and I, let me know if you'd like one, and I'll let you know the scents that we have available.   Thank you!
2641	True	a	"I am an out of work phlebotomist struggling to get by at the moment while I find another hospital to work at.  The bills are piling up and I have no money to pay them.  What bothers me the most about my situation is that my boyfriend, who is super patient and cooperative with me while i'm losing my mind trying to find a job, helps me however I need to whether it is financial or a simple hug at the end of his long day to cheer me up a bit.  I am very upset that I lost my independence...  My boyfriend has been on a diet (Keto) for a few months, and he has decided that he is going to have a ""cheat day"" on his birthday which is in a few days. He has been my rock through these long months and I have nothing to give to him and no money to buy him a gift or even cook him something for his cheat day.  He has done so much for me and all I want to do is give something back to him.  If there is anyone out there that can help me out on his birthday, I'd be so happy!  Even if I can't get a proper gift for him, I think pizza on one of his cheat days should suffice :)  Once I get back on my feet, I am going to send a pizza to some lovely redditors to return the kindness.  "
2642	False	a	Pretty much like the title says. Things are pretty grim around here, and some pizza could really brighten the day (or night, as it is...)   I hope I'm doing this right. I've never been in this position before.  Oh, and I'm in North Texas.
2643	True	a	We're riding on RAGBRAI (ragbrai.com, if you're curious (on mobile! Hard to format!)).   We're sitting around talking about how cool it'd be to have some pizza. 1 pizza. 2 pizzas. 100 pizzas. Any pizza would be cool.   We'll be camping in Perry, IA tomorrow and Des Moines, IA the day after that.   We'll prove it. Internet is limited, but we can call/text easily.   We'll take cool pictures of us eating this hypothetical pizza to help show our gratitude. 
2644	True	a	I'm not the type of person to ask for anything but this past January I lost my job due to going partially blind in my left eye. I have struggled ever since to find any work and have been going from couch to couch. I've been fortunate enough to be able to house sit for a week. Unfortunately the  people im house sitting for have no food here and I'm down to .05 cents to my name. A pizza would really cheer me up right now.
2645	False	a	As the title says, it's been a rough month for my family for a number of reasons financial troubles being on the top of the list. My reason for posting is that groceries have been pretty sparce for the past week or so. The kids, wife and I have been had our fill of bland pastas and such. Payday is in less than a week and the generosity of friends and family in addition to picking up odd jobs here and there are the only things that have gotten us through this month.  Long story short, a pizza sounds unbelievably awesome right about now, even more so when imagine the how excited the kids would be after a week of serving dinner to sad face and disappointed grumbles.
2646	False	a	I'm feeling pretty melancholy. Will be driving 40 minutes on the last gasoline that I have to the RMV to get a new driver's license tomorrow. Luckily, my brother lives nearby, so he's going to lend me the money I need to get a new license. Any size pizza of any type from any nearby place would go a very long way for me (tomorrow would be fantastic, but so would any time this week!) I haven't been able to go food shopping yet this week as I don't get paid until Friday so I have almost nothing to eat here.  Much love guys and thank you for reading.
2647	False	a	Hi! This is my first time here. I've never actually posted before. Not entirely sure how this works, but I figured I'd give it a shot. I'm hungry, and a pizza would be awesome! Thanks to anyone that helps.  
2648	False	a	UK. Just had a conversation with my introvert wife to set up which evenings she can be alone because she started a job with an open office plan and she has to be social all day. Turns out she needs more nights alone than she wants with me. I'm suppose to leave her alone MWF nights and either Saturday or Sunday until 1pm. And now I am extremely sad, want to eat my feelings, and I don't want to ask her for money to do so. Anyone up for enabling me tonight? 
2649	True	a	Closed:]
2650	True	a	Lost my job and im a bit broke. I live paycheck to paycheck and will pickup my last check next Wednesday. That will get me enough food to last a month. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I will pay it forward once im back on my feet.  Thanks for reading!
2651	True	a	I actually don't know what my dad does every weekend but he goes out every Saturday and he forgot to actually buy food for the house. The only thing that's there is his vegetarian food and I'm broker than a joke. :/
2652	False	a	Our rent spiked up by $120 (now being charged for Water and Garbage, monthly pet rent, and increased rent rate) coincidentally on the same month she is graduating college, so things have been a bit crappy the past two weeks. All of our money has gone to the new place, and I know some Dominos would bring her some much needed relief, if even for a night. I appreciate even checking out my post, thanks everybody!
2653	True	a	I'm in North Carolina.
2654	False	a	Hey guys, I have never done this before so be nice to me! ;P  I'm in Pharmacy school in North Dakota (CST) and have three tests this week. I worked last week and weekend and again tomorrow and I am just tired. I have been surviving off of coffee ;P  It is getting about hungry time and I just feel too lazy to get up and make something vs. just order something. (I should be studying all of your renal transporters. ;X)The only downside of course is spending way more money ordering a pizza!  So, if anyone is interested, that would be awesome!
2655	True	a	And therefore couldn't swipe at the dining hall all day today, and I won't be able to get a new one until Monday. It's an enormous flaw in FSU's system. I am so hungry and have no money, and this community  is so impressive and wonderful. I would be so so so appreciative if someone would buy me dinner.
2656	False	a	Flat broke havent ate all day live in memphis tn any help will be greatly appreciated
2657	True	a	Work was cancelled last minute today, for the 2nd time in two weeks.  It's been a bad month, but today has been a particularly bad day- the kind of day that you struggle to get through without crying from the stress of everything.  Pizza would be a nice break from the dreariness of the day!
2658	False	a	Its raining and they would be stoked!
2659	False	a	I live in MA, I'm gluten free, and everything in my apartment that I could eat kind of sucks. I would really, really appreciate some gluten free pizza from domino's for my boyfriend and me :]. Ask me for details and whatnot, I have some other allergies as well.  Hoping to be able to regift some one of these days!
2660	False	a	Dear fellow redditors , I had to pay for a ID card so i could register my self for a loan. But this left me with no money to survive the weekend please help! (Breda , Noord-brabant - The netherlands)
2661	False	a	Hey Redditors,  It has been awhile since I've been on here. January has been a really rough month and I'm just having a pretty crap day. Here's how January went for me. Car broke down at the beginning of the month, which means I've been busing until payday on Friday. My Grammy passed away suddenly from complications from lung cancer on January 11th. Being alone in WA meant a very complicated and extended grieving process as I couldn't get down to Oregon until the day before the funeral. Came back up and found that on top of my car being broken down, my tire went flat as it sat there completely still and parked meaning I'll have to get it fixed and replace a tire now. Then yesterday I was on Skype with my boyfriend who is an Airman and already far away in Omaha and he got orders. They're for Japan. And he leaves in April. We had plans for his leave in June. Those won't happen anymore. So today I am just sad and teary and majorly craving pizza. I do promise to hop back on after Payday and pay it forward, I know how much a pizza can brighten a day!
2662	False	a	So here I am, stuck at home on vacation. I have no money because student loans suck. All I have until Friday is ramen, eggs, and a pickle.    I am hoping someone out there in internet-land will be kind and give me a hand. Thank you in advance  Edit: Forgot to mention I live In RI. And only have access to a Dominoes or a Papa Gino's.
2663	True	a	Hey all, I hate that I have to be this guy, but I know you people are incredibly generous. My name's Chris, I'm 20 and I live on my own (in good old Cincinnati, Ohio). I am out of money and food (I literally have 35 cents and a can of beans /no hobo). I'm currently applying for all sorts of jobs so I don't have to be in this situation for long but I'm still waiting for something to come of it. On a random sunday evening, a pizza would be mighty fine.
2664	False	a	I just paid my rent. Don't get paid until Friday. $0.87 in my bank account until then. Boyfriend is at work until late, and I have no transportation, or money for that matter. This would make my whole day.   Anything is appreciated. :)
2665	False	a	"Hi RandomActsOfPizza,   So, I'm having a terrible weekend. I got given a weeks notice at my ""job"" last week, and other places I've been talking to aren't calling me back. I'm going to run out of money soon, and now I've spent the last three days at home sick, and I am not even going to get my last couple days pay if I can't get well enough to go to work. I had my phone stolen a month ago, and my computer has nearly completely stopped working(and the warranty service has been ignoring me for two months), I'm not sure if I can post this without it freezing again.  RAOP, I'm tired, and hungry, and sick, and so discouraged. Would any kind soul be able to help me out?  Thanks so much."
2666	False	a	After rent, my portion of the utilities and a few groceries, I have less than a dollar in my checking account. I get paid every other Friday and this is an off week. I did grocery shop, so I won't starve, but there is only so much ramen (with egg and sricha!) that one can take . tonight is my night to hunker down and do all the homework. So if any kind soul wants to spot me for some pizza tonight, that'd be pretty awesome. :) 
2667	False	a	"I am a single mother of a wonderful 9 year old boy. For the past 4 years I worked in group homes assisting individuals with developmental disabilities. I was unfairly terminated from my job and recently had to move in with someone because I couldnt make the rent. I would love to be able to sit down with my son and serve him Pizza for dinner it would be a nice change of pace from the usual mix of ramen noodles and staples that we get with govt. assistance. I will be ""Offering"" as soon as I get back on my feet.........."
2668	False	a	I would love to brighten up my husbands' day with a pizza(his favorite food). He works so hard for us (2 kids under 2 and me, the wife) and we just learned that he lost his job today. I promise to give back as soon as my husband gets another job (Hopefully soon as the staffing agency told him they will email him about another job).
2669	True	a	*just to be clear: by CA, I mean California
2670	False	a	I can give you $25 dollar iTunes card ,I'm super hungry and would love some pizza. thanks edit in Nebraska
2671	False	a	Would love a delicious pizza instead of having to cook for Monday Night Football!  It's either pizza or beans and rice, which isn't as celebratory for what's sure to be a great game.  My husband would be way happier with pizza.
2672	False	a	My work laid me off and my funds are quite tight at the moment. I've been eating a spartan diet and would really appreciate a pie; it would make my week. I'm in Canada so I'm not sure if my location will muck up the works, but it can be done then I sure would appreciate it. Thanks in advance.  Edit: I'd like to cancel my request.   I have a pal IRL that has spotted me some funds for a pie and even bought be some groceries. I'm touched by their kindness and look forward to paying it forward.   I hope anyone that felt inclined to buy me a pie would invest their kindness somewhere else on this subreddit or IRL!
2673	False	a	Is there any chance someone could help me out with dinner tonight? I am a broke college kid working on a chunk of my thesis as well as two other assignments for midterm week from now until like...at least the next 8 hours. I would be forever grateful, thanks! 
2674	False	a	You can tell me what to draw, or I will simply draw a picture of us enjoying the pizza:) We could defiantly use some help right now.
2675	False	a	i have recently been taken off government support due to a missed appointment. This was down to non receipt of payment (through no fault of my own) which then lead to me not being able to afford to make it to this appointment! I have re applied but this is going to take 3-4 weeks:( help me out please? thanks.
2676	True	a	Hi all, I feel terrible doing this as I have never had to ask for pizza before, but am in a bad spot right now, and can't afford any food until my next paycheck. I could make some pizza last a few days if anyone could help.   If you have any questions feel free to let me know. Thanks!  EDIT: A huge thanks to [eetzatrap1300](http://www.reddit.com/user/eetzatrap1300). My request has been fulfilled!!
2677	False	a	Need a pizza me my husband and our 4 year old are hungry no money till pay day nor any food in the house please help opps forgot to put clintonville wisconsin
2678	False	a	Mmmmmmm pizza. Don't know what happened to my post. Confused and new. We are ready for a random act of pizza to fall upon us. We are cheesy, saucy pizza livers who can't buy any due to stupid injury at work. Pizza us lol.
2679	False	a	Long story short: six fish sticks and less than half a head of iceberg between the two of us (my brother and I) in the fridge until friday morning. Ends are being met, but food is at the bottom of the list. lil help? I can't say I can offer anything in return, other than mounds of appreciation...well no wait, if you can think of something i can do in return, ill try my best to fulfill. more than willing to pay it forward, but if you can think of something else i can do, let me know. thanks :)
2680	True	a	Gonna be honest here, I sort of shot myself in the foot. Went to Seattle to meet some buddies from a game I play and kind of spent a bit too much money... We had a blast though! PAX 2011 YEAH! 2 days after PAX 2011... not so yeah.   Anyway, I get paid on Thursday (well, maybe Thursday, if not this Thursday than next Thursday and if that's true I'm super nyerked) and will DEFINITELY pay the pizza back to some other redditor! Not going to whine if I don't get a pizza but it'd be pretty awesome if my broke, gamer ass got fed D:   I've been following reddit for awhile now because of my boyfriend, so even though my account is new I've been a lurker on this website for a few months now. He's actually the one who suggested I try reddit because he's at work and can't be much help atm :]   Anything would be appreciated guys!  (And as much as I love this sub reddit, I feel so guilty using it ;___; )  
2681	False	a	I lost my wallet which has my cash/credit card/university ID and such. I'm on a meal plan here, but I can't go to the cafeterias since I don't have my ID. I could really use a pizza right now. :/
2682	False	a	Warning: Sob story. Sorry :-/  For starters, sorry for using a throwaway account, but my situation is beyond embarrassing. Posting on my main won't do any good, I don't have any friends, much less anyone that knows me and likes me enough to help out. I understand if you choose to not help because of this, but I can also do my best to provide any proof you'd like within reason.  To keep it short and sweet, I don't have a place to stay right now. I have 2 degrees, recently graduated, but I did something stupid during my first year of college, and have a misdemeanor on my record that I believe has been preventing me from obtaining employment. I have been trying to save up to get it expunged but recently lost the retail job I did have over some really silly shenanigans (boss with nothing better to do than fire people). I managed to land a job interview this week, and was just notified I made it to round 2 on Monday, for a really decently paying position.  I lived check to check, so as of today I'll be living out of my car for 2-4 weeks until a good friend of mine moves into town, who's going to let me stay with him. Food and money is scarce, no way to make ramen anymore, so it'll probably be the dollar menu for a while. I've got one tank of gas to last me. Could someone toss a papa john's gift card my way? They're all over town... I'd be eternally grateful! I can't post on /r/loans because I don't know when I'll be able to pay back, and no way of preparing food from /r/foodpantry, so I figured this is the only assistance subreddit that could really help, even if only a meal for the weekend.   Well, that was not so short and sweet. Sorry... again &gt;_&lt;.  ps: If anyone knows of a way to make quick buck besides prostituting myself, please let me know. I'd be happy to do anything  
2683	False	a	I just recently relocated here from Texas to work on Master's degree at Fairmont State University and since I have to live in the dormitories here for the summer I was forced to also buy the meal plan for the summer.  It is sadly closed Friday-Sunday, and this week will be closed for Memorial day.  My brother (Fapocalypse_Now) suggested I check this out.  Thanks.
2684	False	a	This guy just beat cancer, and it's his reddit birthday. How do we send this mofo some ZA? (Unfortunately I don't have a credit card or I'd send one myself)  http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ju6x5/looks_like_its_my_reddit_cake_day_today_here_is_a/
2685	False	a	Thanks! It's friday night and we're hungry and watching Star Trek.  Edit: I'm verified
2686	True	a	And I just ate the last two eggs in my APT and now only have a can of chicken noodle soup,some potato wedges,minute rice and half a loaf of bread in my kitchen. I've been working my ass off for the past month but recently had to put 900 bucks into my car two weeks before my rent was due. After paying rent on the 1st I had 35 bucks to last me 10 days until pay day. I am now down to 7 bucks and I work Tomorrow, Thursday and Friday. I have just over qtr of a tank left and my work is 12 miles from my apt, so I'm pretty much spending that 7 bucks on gas in hopes that it will get me enough to get to work. I have gotten pizzas on here before, and i've been lurking thru the threads this week trying to win a pizza but every time i'm to late. I know that RAOP gets these type of sob stories all day, and a lot of them arent rewarded so i'm not really putting to much hope into this. I just thought it would be nice to try and get a large pizza that I could munch on for a few days so I dont starve before pay day.
2687	True	a	Hello /RAOP! I've been a Redditor for quite some time now, and have seen the amazing generosity that this forum can produce. (EDIT: This is not my main account. I can verify through PMs my other account.)  I've got two younger sisters, a mother going to school full time for her masters (almost there!), and a girlfriend. We all live under the same roof, and here lately, things have been a bit rough. We haven't been grocery shopping in about a month or so, and have no money do to so at the moment. We're holding out for our grants (we all go to school), but unfortunately those will not arrive for another couple of weeks.   I beseech you RAOP, can you make our entire month? We would love to sit around the table and share a meal, it's been too long.  Thank you always for your generosity.  SIDENOTE - I can verify using the tool listed in the sidebar, as well as deliver pictures of our incredibly empty fridge/freezer and pantry. 
2688	False	a	A pizza and hopefully a story about your life and how you're enjoying it. Just so I know that there are awesome times in life :)  I do live in Canada so I'm hoping that's not a problem.
2689	True	a	Heya! I just recently moved from CA to Texas for school and it's left me pretty broke. Living with my aunt, but we have no groceries in the house and I'm going to be alone all weekend by myself. I don't like taking things for free, and I won't have any money to pay it forward for a week or two. So if I get a pizza I'll [play it forward](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/) and give away 3 games that are in my inventory. I probably won't get the pizza until tomorrow sometime to hold me over until Sunday. Thanks all! Any other questions just ask. :)  Edit: Guess I should mention that I'm in Edinburg, TX :D
2690	True	a	I'll pay it forward when I have money
2691	True	a	Hey, I don't normally do this kind of thing, but it would really help me right now. I have found myself to be recently homeless with no food or money, and being that I am hypoglycemic, I probably should do something about it. If anyone could send me a pizza, I could make it last me several days and it would keep my glucose levels at least somewhat stable. This is a temporary situation and I intend to get back onto my feet, but for now I am in need of any kind of help I can get. I would greatly appreciate it.
2692	True	a	Hello there,   I'm a broooooooooke college student who would be absolutely thrilled to have a pizza this afternoon after a killer midterm and day at work that I just can't afford to splurge on myself.    If not, oh well, what can ya do?  Happy Friday !
2693	False	a	havnt had pizza since my friends birthday and all a sudden i am really craving for some pizza  Surrey,BC
2694	True	a	I'm helping her pack up and we would love some delicious pizza. She just quit her job to go follow her SO across the state, I'm broke and waiting on my financial aid check to miraculously appear soon, helping her out instead of studying.  We would appreciate it and will pass it on when things brighten up financially!
2695	False	a	Okay here's the deal:  A friend of mine has agreed to be the Foster Mother for a Dog in need... However, the organization has all of the sudden burdened her with the costs of Flea and Parasitic Removal treatments, costing over $200!! Normally a Foster agency will cover these costs but this particular one says those fees aren't included in their reimbursement policies... Instead of turning it down and returning the dog she paid to have the dog cured of it's problems like a truly selfless person!  pic of the dog she's fostering : http://i.imgur.com/ziQLZ.png  Video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGu_-4CBtvA&amp;context=C3355516ADOEgsToPDskJYkuuuuA8wYj3_RjQDg61o  She's currently in a bind and is trying hard to get through the next week just feeding herself until pay day since she's been hit by these unexpected fees. If anyone is in a better situation it would be great if we could surprise this animal lover with a Random Act of Pizza!!!!  Please respond in private messages or give the following AIM name a message : Tick373
2696	False	a	This is my first time requesting for a pizza. Pizzas always cheer me up no matter what the situation is. I hope I am doing this right.  EDIT: forgot my location, Rochester NY
2697	False	a	I've been having one heck of a time this month. First I came down with a really bad bug and missed work (Full-time student so I only work a couple nights a week) Then my water pump started leaking on my car. I spent every penny to my name on a replacement and managed to put the car back together without any left over bolts. Then last monday the car decided that I did not need a transmission that works. So I'm stranded on foot waiting for income taxes to come in so I can fix/replace the car.   I'm buried in homework at the moment and sitting here trying to finish a project thats worth half of my grade. A hot pizza would make the night much more enjoyable.   Thanks in advance 
2698	False	a	What sounds like a pathetic sob story, is actually true. I was a merchandiser that got laid off from my company on 11/20. So, no money flow. I had three classes I needed to finish to grad with my degree and, like an idiot, I missed my last final and now my teacher has already gone out of the country (she's Indian and won't be back till 2 weeks from today). I can take screen shots to prove all this if you don't believe me. Basically, I'm having a pretty terrible holiday season.  Figured it was worth a shot here to get a pizza to lift my spirits. If you donate, whenever I get a job or take that final, I will send you a pizza AND BREADSTICKS!!@#!@!!! Also, if you want to ask me one question about the moon, I can answer that.  Thanks either way and we should have a jumping high five in 3....2.....1
2699	True	a	Hi,       Its the end of the month, hubby and i would love to have a pizza on Friday or tonight :) It's been a while since we had the pleasure of cheeses and bacon.   I am new to this so hopefully I did this request right.   Edit: Just got my egift card for a pizza with Papa Johns from Masterboat seriously thank you so much! We really apperciate it!!!! 2nd Edit: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/87uIp.jpg)  Here is a photo of our yummy pizza. It was super awesome and the bacon was the best part. Thanks again masterboat!  
2700	False	a	Hay reddit, about a year ago my mom got colon cancer and they had to do a big surgery to remove it. ( the took out about two feet of her colon) just this week she went back in only to find out that she had a 4x5x6 tumor on the right side of her brain. My dad's a trucker and until he can get back home (today hopeful) I've been left to fend for my self. I am craving a pizza but I have no money; could someone help me out with that?  
2701	False	a	Looking for someone to be really kind and buy a pizza or some food, within UK, not really bothered to what, as haven't eaten properly for the last few weeks and anything would be very much appreciated.  Been left with very little money this month thanks to unknowing bills popping up, and my boyfriends mobile company giving him an expensive bill of ¬£56 compared to his usual ¬£25.. So I've had to lend money I didn't really have to help save his ass.   I'd/We'd be really grateful to any offers of any kind of food. Since we haven't ate much of anything for the last few weeks.  So I will say thank you in advance of any extra kind Redditors!! :D
2702	False	a	Hi, RAOP. Just as the title says. I'm an unemployed college student and I've been avoiding meals where I can because I can't afford to go out (even to Mickey D's) and we don't even have fruit, vegetables, or snack foods. Little sister is kinda fat and eats everything that doesn't make me gag. Is anyone feeling charitable?
2703	False	a	Please and thank you!
2704	False	a	I know there's probably nowhere open at this hour, but if someone does know, all I need to know is where and if they deliver.
2705	False	a	Working as much as I can but struggling. All our money is going to try to catch up on house payments. In debt and worried. Some pizza would be great. Thanks everyone for your time and attention. Located in NY.
2706	False	a	My brother is 18 and im 15, My mom right now is in florida taking a little mental health vacation since shes a teacher, and her students are really huge cunts. I was wondering if one of you guys would buy us dinner, I think it would be a nice surprise for my brother too. Thanks!
2707	False	a	I just found this site and I'm happy people actually send pizza. I'm really hungry and I have no food in the fridge. I just got back to my apartment tonight and I didn't eat dinner and I probably won't eat tomorrow either. My parents won't be able to give me money for a while. Can someone please help me with one of those EGIFT cards people give out? I can make some pizza last. I love Domino's. It's around the corner and the closest to me. So, hopefully when i wake up tomorrow I'll have some comments and a pizza by tomorrow night. 
2708	False	a	Just got home with family 3 kids and fiance. Fridge is dead food spoiled and dont have money on us. Please suprise us. Only have pizza hut in little town. Thanks
2709	False	a	Help I'm hungry!!
2710	False	a	Hey guys, I'm starving, and currently have no money on me. I'm house sitting my friend's and there is NO food in the entire place, so I have no way to eat at the moment. I'm not broke, just hungry. I'll repay the favor, and am willing to work for it!  Thanks all, you're the best.
2711	True	a	Hello! I was laid off about 3 months ago, and haven't been able to find a job since. For 4-5ish months(maybe alittle less) my fiance had been hit by a truck and was out of work for that long. She has been back to work for about 2 months so we've been just getting by on payments. We had to take a loan out to pay for car issues and since I haven't been able to find a job, our bills are being paid late every month until we can finish paying this loan off. It's been fairly depressing, and I can see it affecting her and our relationship quite a bit. I hurt my back not long ago and have been in PT getting it fixed up.  So my job searching hasn't been the best, they thought I would have to have surgery, now were working on just getting it to be anon pinched nerve so I can actually move more. We don't argue about money/food a lot, but I know it is affecting her and making her stressed.. And it hurts me to see it.  Anyways. In my fridge is milk and yogurt. Rice and frozen veggies is in the freezer(Rice in cabinet).. And we've basically been eating Ramen or rice for the past few weeks as we haven't gone shopping in a long time. It's her 2 days off starting today and if, out of the generosity of reddit users we could get 1 or 2 pizzas(2 would be optimum for left overs for the next dinner, but 1 is fine) I will gladly gift, post pictures, and even send you a thank you letter/upvote you for life.  I have these: HL2,HL2:ep1,Portal,Magicka:vietnam Edit: I also have some Wii games(and GC games as I've been trying to sell it all for money). Mario galaxy 2, mario bros wii, and a ton of GC games. Paper mario, luigis mansion, zelda, the good stuff.   I also have Reddit friends that could confirm what I've said above^ So I don't look like some random dude just wanting free food. Thanks for consideration.
2712	False	a	...Okay, we aren't *literally* starving (we have a few things to hold us over), but the only thing we have thawed out is hamburger meat, and we're going to do hamburgers tonight. However, my sister and I would love something to hold us over until then!  My mom's out right now, so a pizza to share between the two of us would be swell. &lt;3 I'm willing to go pick it up too, so you save money on the delivery!  I really don't know how to market this, sorry.  **edit**: plus, pizza just sounds really good. we're from the bay area~
2713	False	a	http://www.mordours.com/
2714	True	a	We've been pretty responsible people, my Girlfriend and I.  We've worked hard, spent within our means, and have always been on time with all of our bills and rent.  It seems that last part may have gotten us in a bit of deep water.  After doing the right thing and scraping by, it has come.  My Girlfriend's student loans have kicked in.  This has been a bit of a culture shock to us, and in all honesty, we weren't prepared.    Our total amount of bills almost doubled because of this new one.  My girlfriend has been a bit stressed of late, as have I, because it's increasingly looking like one of us(if not both) is going to have to take on a second job, or the eviction fairy shall be making it's rounds.  We have enough food for maybe one meal, and the nearest payday is next week.  It would be a great stress reliever, and an overall solid evening if me and my girlfriend could share a Pizza tonight.    It would be double the awesome, because her absolute favorite food is pizza, and seems skeptical of this entire community(Reddit all together, not just RAOP). If one of you fine Redditors could show us the way to pizza goodness, not only will you have the good karma, and satisfaction of helping a hard working college grad out, I'll also get my girlfriend to draw you a rad picture!  Win, Win in my book.    I'm located in NW Ohio, and at the moment we only have a Pizza Hut within the miles we have gas to make it too. Thank you in advance, and know, that I am in love with the RAOP community.  This is a true beacon of humanity.  Kudos!   EDIT: Thanks so much to Frankto for hookin' it up!
2715	False	a	Hey, first time posting in this subreddit. There is not really anything to eat in my house and I am starving. Maybe I could get a fairly sizeable pizza? Anything you can give is much appreciated, thanks!
2716	True	a	My partner and I are currently both out of work, sleeping on a mates floor, and for the past few months have never had more than 50 pounds to our name each week.   I was  severely unwell on a day I had an appointment at the job centre last week,  and would have been paid our meagre amount to live on  yesterday, but due to my illness we will not have any money for at least four more days until the job centre process their paperwork.   We have 1 pound in coppers, and half a bag of rice to survive on, but could really do with a wholesome meal to keep us going for the next few days, especially as I have a job interview tomorrow for which I do not want to be a weak mess.  Any kind of offer will be greatly appreciated and thanks for reading.
2717	False	a	Just trying to make it to payday on Thursday getting by on toast but the bread's almost gone.
2718	False	a	Don't really have money for food right now. I haven't eaten yet today. That's about it.
2719	False	a	I'm starving, trying to get work done, and my roommate is an asshole.
2720	False	a	Hello,  Yesterday I went to get groceries and I switch to small bag purse. Now my wallet is in the small bag purse. In my wallet it has my ID so I can't get money at a bank. Today is payday and I do have money but no access to it.I am too afraid to ask my coworkers to borrow money as I am a student worker so my coworkers are all my supervisors.  I work at 8am everyday and I skip breakfast. I don't want to be greedy and get a whole pizza so that is why I am asking for a sandwich.  You can check my account, I have send strangers random cards to try to pay it forward.  EDIT: I didn't get anything but that is okay. I get off work in a hour and I can go home and finally eat something.
2721	False	a	So, it's been pretty hard lately. My mom was laid off from her job as a teachers aid. There's canned stuff but we ate all the feasible stuff and now only have stuff like pureed carrots. The pizza wouldn't actually be for me, I'll survive, but I would really like something to brighten up my sisters day. My mother told her she didn't have to go to school today because she knew she may not be able to concentrate that much but my sister , who is 9 was like eff that and had cream corn for breakfast and went anyway. She is trying so hard not to be sad because she doesn't want to make my mom feel bad. She even offered to sell(pawn) her Nintendo DS to pay the water bill that came today. But my mom promised we wouldnt do that anymore...thanks to anyone who wants to help!  Edit: In GA 
2722	False	a	Here's the dealio. Me, my girlfriend, and my housemate are really hungry for pizza (and love). There's nothing in the house but chili and it's really hot so chili is utterly unappealing. Who wants to help out 3 random college kids? Please and thanks. Much love.
2723	False	a	unemployed, not eating tonight, thought id at least try.
2724	False	a	Hello, /r/, I am a 19 year old male in sunny Miami who is in a situation that's anything but sunny. I recently lost my job (August 15th was my last day), and I've been living with my mother since the job hunt is not going well. My mom is a 55 year-old who cleans houses for a living, barely able to scrap together the $915 rent, as well as the $220 light bill, $90 cable and internet bill, and our $110 cell phone bill.   When I had a job, I'd pay for half of everything. Rent, cable, light, and cell phone. We had plenty to eat, and I'd take her out for dinner, and even pay her day's work so she'd have a day to rest.  Now, she pays for everything, and sometimes she works 2-3 jobs every day. I keep going to job interviews, but to no avail. We have no food. We go shopping once a month, but how much can $80 in food last you?  I'm hungry, /r/, I ate my first bit of food for the first time in 2 days today, and it was horrible.  I long for some good food, and I long for the kindness of strangers.  
2725	False	a	Hey,  It's been a rough week and I'm tired of eating rice and ramen. A pizza would sure hit the spot. I live in Dublin/Ireland.  Thanks
2726	False	a	My GF and I both work at Kroger which pays not well at all. We both have no money that can go towards food and have been eating rice for a week. Our fridge broke this week so all of our refrigerated food had to be thrown away or eaten a couple days ago. Any pizza would be appreciated. Thank you ahead of time if you can offer. Also, We live in Atlanta, Ga.  
2727	False	a	I just finished my last day as an intern! I spent 3 months as a glorified slave with no income, and have been rewarded with a job offer at the company (part-time, but at least it's relevant to my degree). New job starts Monday but for now I'm still far beyond broke. I'd love to blow off some steam and celebrate the end of this hellish experience. Anybody who would help me out would instantly reach hero status in my mind.
2728	False	a	Not like a ton as an asinine prank, but a couple pizzas for serious as an olive branch of sorts.  I would but i'm broke.  **EDIT** - [Link for those confused about why I submitted this](http://i.imgur.com/Z5mpy.png)
2729	False	a	Just moved to London on my own, first time away from home. Have just finished my degree but don't start work until the beginning of October, so won't be paid until November! I have enough money to cover the bills and basic food, but would kill for a nice pizza tonight. Many thanks!
2730	False	a	I just paid the last of my bills, and now have 3 dollars in my wallet. I wont be getting any more money for at least 5 more days, and currently have 2 packets of mac and cheese to eat. Not exactly sure what I'm going to do, my stomach is really starting to hurt from not eating. I feel pretty weird asking for food like this but I love this whole operation. I'd promise to pay it forward soon as I am able!  I'm in Westwood, CA...
2731	False	a	Some unexpected medical bills came up and I ended up completely broke.  I haven't eaten since Tuesday morning and I can't describe how hungry I am.  If someone, anyone, can help me out today I would be eternally in your debt.  
2732	True	a	Hello, we've posted before when we first got to Cali back in August, but never got a response so we thought we'd give it another shot. There are 4 of us here, 2 kids and 2 adults, just looking to see if there are any kind people out there willing to help us out with Dinner tonight. Haven't had the best of luck since we got to Cali. Yesterday was Halloween, but kids didn't get to do anything other than go hang out at church cause we couldn't afford to do costumes this year.   If there are any kind heart'd people on tonight willing to help us out this one time it would be great. I'll be able to donate $10 to someone on the 18th, i realize it's not much, but I've seen others like myself on here seeking help so i'm going to try my best to do help them out whether someone helps me or not. But once again we're asking if there are any kind heart'd ppl out there willing to help us this time we'd really appreciate it.   Thank You &amp; God Bless
2733	False	a	**CLOSED - FOUND HOT DOGS IN FREEZER**  My aunt is having problems with her husband(possibly getting a divorce) and had to get out of the house. It is my understanding he has been hiding money from her and only giving her enough to pay the bills leaving nearly nothing for her and their five kids.  I would buy the pizza myself buy I am unemployed. If someone would be kind enough to buy us some food I am sure we all would appreciate it.  Location: Central California
2734	False	a	Don't forget to request that the pizza place draw a unicorn on the box...
2735	True	a	Austin, Texas  My two roommates and I are hungry as hell. We were all sort of counting on the deposit from our last apartment to help us out, but they claimed there was damages, so we did not receive anything. So, we're sort of struggling. Is anyone able to help us out for dinner tonight? We'd really appreciate it!  EDIT: Received a Dominos gift card from jetboyterp! THANK YOU!
2736	False	a	Just two guys near the Seattle Center needing a pie to get us through Tomb Raider II.
2737	True	a	I just got back from my first job interview after 6 months of nothing. Feel like celebrating, but ramen and eggs don't make for the best celebratory food. If anyone's feeling generous I would really enjoy a pizza tonight, and of course would pay it forward once I get this job.    edit: thanks to ftothec!
2738	True	a	Normally we go out to eat but with my schooling taking up all my time/money and my fiance having recently lost his job, that's just not an option this year.  We have been struggling for a while now - you pretty much have to know someone to get a job in this tiny town (middle of nowhere Missouri).  We are living with my fiance's mom, stepdad, grandma, and sister and funds are always very limited; pizza is a huge commodity.                If someone could please help brighten up our anniversary we would be so incredibly thankful and promise to pay it forward when we're back on our feet.  I would keep it a secret from my fiance until it's ready, try to make it as fun as possible, ya know?  : )             [Here we are a year ago today!](http://imgur.com/hp7Jb)       ------------------------------       EDIT: alrightillwrite2 has been kind enough to gift us with a Papa John's gift card!!  You are the sweetest, thank you for making our anniversary special and a day to remember  : )   I *will* repay you some day, friend.
2739	False	a	Anyone willing to donate a pizza? Would really like to share it with my friend. Nothing to eat at his house and I'm gonna be here the whole weekend. Any donations would really be appreciated :D I live in the Atlanta area in Georgia.
2740	False	a	I've been working since 5 without a meal since 9:30am and that entails being hung up on because I'm a college student trying to fill out surveys and that means I have to interrupt people at dinner time. If anyone wants to help me feed myself while I try not get too bothered by people hating me, I would love you forever and be permanently indebted.
2741	False	a	Some pizza would be a lovely way to cheer up :) I posted in /r/randomactsofpizza on Friday but nothing came of it, so I figured it might be OK if I posted here.
2742	False	a	Im a kid with no job and my parents left with my brother to go to college.  I would like to eat something other than stale Ritz crackers :(
2743	True	a	Hey guys. So it's Friday night and I'm doing work/preparing for finals next week. It's a long night of work ahead of me...(weekend as well). I'm running low on funds (the heat bill this winter was been ridiculous) and a girl would love a nice old cheese pizza to feed me for the next day or so. There's a rumbly in my tumbly; it would make all this coding more bearable!   Apparently the odds are slim but I would truly appreciate if someone would help me out. If not, peace, love...and enjoy your weekend!
2744	True	a	I've been living off peanut butter and milk the past couple of days waiting for my student loans to disburse. The idea of a pizza, man, can't even describe how nice that would be.
2745	False	a	I won't be able to get any grocery money until tomorrow and I am down to a lonely can of baked beans. Could anyone help?  Thanks guys, I love this subreddit and all the good it has done.  Edit: Thank you so much ass_man007 for sending me a gift card. :D
2746	False	a	Driving from Michigan to Georgia. Thank you so much if someone actually responds to this.
2747	False	a	Well, i assume you want to hear why i went negative.... I put gas in my car this morning (I had 10 or so dollars) but in reality, when i used my card at a gas station 2 days before, it was run through as credit and didnt come out until this afternoon, leaving me with negative funds.  I do not get paid until tomorrow and probably wont eat until around 1-2 PM when my check goes through (direct deposit) Any help is appreciated, and i'll be sure to repay the favor.  God bless.  Edit, for proof : http://imgur.com/HTY95
2748	False	a	There's only one thing that could complete this night and with your help, we can do it
2749	False	a	Made this account because I'm one of them lurker folk :P I broke my arm and didn't have insurance (couldn't afford) so now I'm in a bad boat :( Anything will be appreciated, even a gift card for like 5$ or something!
2750	False	a	Hi we are a family of 3 in louisville ky mom dad and we have a 6 yr old daughter.We are low on food and dont get paid till tomorrow could anyone please help us with some pizza for dinner we are hungry thanks
2751	True	a	My brother and I are both broke, unemployed USMC veterans who are trying to find jobs for the summer in between college semesters (Good news! We have interviews with the same business tomorrow afternoon.) We've both been working odd jobs during the graveyard shift, so we're up all night and sleep during the mid-morning/early afternoon. We've been spacing out the few dollars we had for ramen noodles, but even our change jars are empty now. Since we haven't eaten since Saturday, a pizza would be the best thing ever. Plus, I'm sure we could make it last a couple days. I will absolutely pay it forward once we get some money coming in.
2752	False	a	I'm in southwestern Michigan, and I've kinda lost all hope in this situation. My buddy and I haven't had anything to eat for a while now and I don't think we can afford to. If anyone could help I would really appreciate it, we ran out of Raman noodles a couple days ago and don't know what to do... Our finances are even screwed for this next month completely, I need some little beacon of light and a pizza would go a long way right now.
2753	True	a	Hi, RAOP. So, things are bad: I'm waiting on help from my relatives to pay rent (late) and utilities (also late). My girlfriend and I haven't been able to find work and are having a very hard time making ends meet. The power was shut off this morning, and we don't have enough money to get it turned on--or any food that doesn't require cooking.  I'm looking into getting help from relatives sooner rather than later on the power bill, but I don't know exactly when that's going to happen. At this point, I'd judge this request to be more of a need than a want.   Full disclosure: We've gotten pizza through RAOP twice. Once was through a request a few weeks ago, and the other was a totally unsolicited offer after my girlfriend got into a conversation with someone here. Both times we were a bit better off than we are now, but we didn't have much to eat in the house and we couldn't afford the pizza ourselves.   Oh, I should mention--I have a battery backup that's giving us Internet access at the moment. It'll be out of juice sometime today, so we'll either use the last of our batteries to use a nearby wireless network or head to the library.   Thanks for staying with me through this wall of text.   Edit: Girlfriend said I should offer proof as there's been a lot of fake requests and offers here lately. We can give you a picture of the shutoff notice, or something like that. Reply or send a PM.
2754	False	a	Well, here is the sob story.  I just moved in with my sister and brother in law.. They bought a new house and need a roommate, and knowing that I am just out of college and looking for work and all that.. they got me to do it. :P  The first week I moved down here, the small amount of money that I had to get through to find a job was frozen in my bank account because Bank of America is such a PoS. I was literally down here a week, and without any notice/phone call/email.. etc. they froze my account and reissued my debit card back to my parents house where I was living (a days trip away, in another state). I was there planning to cancel my account, when they told me I was going to be unable to do so without my new card... that was a couple of days away in the mail. So basically I am broke as shit. :/  I just started my new job down here, but they pay bi-weekly. I just received my first check, but it immediately had to go to the new bank that I have for student loans and car insurance, to avoid late payments. So for the next two weeks I am broke and even have to bum gas money off of my sister to get to work until I am paid, and she cant really afford to be helping me as much as she is already.  I'd really like to do something nice for her in the meantime... so, anyone want to give me a hand?  Sorry for the wall of text... and not really sure of what else to do, just found this awesome subreddit :)
2755	False	a	I would buy one myself if I could.
2756	False	a	Hey RAOP, this is my first time requesting, and I'll pay it forward as soon I land some work!   I'm recently back to Los Angeles after looking for work in Oklahoma (blew my 401k in the process). I'm sleeping on a friend's floor and he's gone for the weekend. All that's left in the pantry is a can of tuna and some potatoes with ears! Would anyone be willing to pizza me today? I'll love you forever!
2757	True	a	Sorry for the new account, but I never had a reason to make an account before this.  I have been surfing Reddit for quite a while.  I get paid every other Friday and won't get another paycheck until July 1st.  I don't have any money or food in the house and all the local places that help with food are closed until Monday.   A pizza would really lift my spirits.  If anyone is willing to help me I would sincerely appreciate it.  Thank you!  Edit: hogfathom got me a pizza thank u so much
2758	False	a	The title says it all I am about to turn 18. When I do that means cutting a lot of expensive things for a while. So all I request from this beautiful subreddit is to let me have a swell time eating pizza :) [7].
2759	False	a	I just bailed a childhood friend out of jail today. He had been getting mixed up in drugs, and honestly, I hadn't spoken to him in about a year. But I never stopped caring about him. He got pulled over, and cops found a bag of weed. He got arrested and no one else, even his family, came to get him out. Cost me around $1000 to release him... Im dry with money now and could use a a pizza... I of course would pass along the generosity 
2760	True	a	Our local football team played a great game last night we absolutely enjoyed the game. My niece stayed the night last night and will be doing so again tonight. I would love to surprise them both with pizza. Small or medium would feed them both (they are 2 and 6) and make them and myself so happy. 
2761	False	a	I've toyed with asking for a pizza, but i've had some help from friends and family these past weeks, but going on 2 interviews and not landing the job has really kicked me down a notch.  I also worried about tipping the driver, how does that work if someone donates a card? I wouldn't want a pizza if it meant stiffing the delivery guy...
2762	False	a	I have just started a great job after being out of work for a month. All of our funds were eaten while I was out of work. Anything would be appreciated we are just hungry and have nothing left. Make sure yall have a great day. I'm in dallas TX. 
2763	False	a	It's sad I know. I really dislike Optics but it's one of those courses I have to take to graduate (computer engineering), kind of irrelevant for the field I want to go into. I will be forever grateful to whoever the mystery-pizza-sender is and will pass on the random-act-of-kindness to another stranger in some way or another.
2764	False	a	Stuck at UMW where we're currently on lockdown because of Irene, and Irene isn't even all that awful here! I've been listening to my roommate sing showtunes for the past four hours. Life is HARD.
2765	False	a	My sister told me about this, last week the wife walked out on me and left the kids, she froze all the bank accounts and I don't get paid until Friday. I'd really like to cheer the kids up with some pizza. Any help would be great in these tough times.
2766	True	a	"Honestly, I dont know what to put here. Im not preggos, I have no shitty roommate. I live with my girlfriend and my 2 cats. Ive been unemployed for 3 years and Im not on any kind of ""benefits"". Usually, I dont like asking for help like this, but unfortunately I have nothing for us to eat tonight except for a quarter box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch. While normally, this would be totally awesome, we have done nothing but eat CTC for the last 2 days. Im at the point where Im down to trade for a pizza or two. I attend Comic-Con every year and I do have some spare memorabilia Ive gotten in years past. I would totally be willing to trade somebody some comic-con swag for some food. Thanks for reading.  Oh, i live in Orange County California, fyi. Thanks Again.  :edit:Awesome! Got a pizza tonight from ""truongbv"" Saved the day!"
2767	False	a	"Hey RAOP, I'm chilling here in my dorm room and could use a great hot pie. I managed to land myself in a ""suitcase university""--almost everyone goes home on the weekends. It's pretty lonely here. I have gifted before and would really appreciate some pizza. I absolutely LOVE Casey's pizza, but that's a midwest thing. Otherwise we have Pizza Hut close, and I'm not sure what else.   Thanks a million for reading. "
2768	False	a	Using a throwaway account because my siblings haven't been told yet and I don't want them finding out on the internet, since they all use reddit. My Dad has been a hero for as long as I can remember - he helped take care of me the best he could after my Mom and her side of the family disowned me for being gay. My aunt called me today with the news and broke down crying. It makes me feel even worse knowing she has to call my other three siblings and repeat the process.  I'm just really numb, broke and hungry right now, and nothing would help me feel a little bit better right at this moment than a pizza, a pair of sweatpants, and a tv marathon.  I'll pay it forward as soon as I can to another hungry redditor. 
2769	False	a	First time ever on here, would love any pizza please, very hungry with the munchies
2770	False	a	We're down at our pal's family-owned home, and we're willing to pay it forward. Our friend is leaving for college and a 2 year service mission soon, and we would love a pizza to enjoy in our last big hoorah together. If you would like an drawn picture of any SFW thing you request, we will draw it for you with questionable quality. We can also offer some motivational words for you, if that's what you'd like. The only pizza place around is Domino's. Thank you!
2771	False	a	Me and my girl are doing a Juice Fast. You can see my daily entries and workouts at www.juiceoverjunk.com. We have only had Juice and Water for the last 24 days, We started June 1st and will be ending June 30th. We will then be having Vegetables and fruit for the next 15 days to break the fast properly, working our way to solid foods. We have enough money for Pizza, but I was wondering if anyone wanted to treat us and be the person to give us our first Pizza / order out since the fast. That would be sometime around mid July. Sorry if I am doing this wrong. I just been lurking in this subreddit for some time, and thinking pizza this whole month. It would really be cool to participate.  We are in Middle River, Maryland btw.  Thanks in advance all.
2772	False	a	I'm really hungry and I just want a pizza. I've been craving one over the past few days and I want a pizza. Papa John's or some local pizza is preferred. Thanks in advance. Edit: My friend can also draw you a cartoonish picture of your choice, if you'd like.
2773	False	a	Holidays are rough for our family this year, and aren't going to be that good. Kind of has us depressed. Regardless we managed to pick up a couple things for each other and our boys and would love to end our bargain hunting night with a pizza. A little holiday cheer if you will for us and the kids.   This is simply a want, not a need. We have other things to make up in the house for dinner, just would be nice to have a pizza for a treat.. Been lurking here and other reddits once in awhile and enjoy seeing each one of you giving :) 
2774	True	a	I just want to start off by saying how wonderful this community is. I've been looking at some of these posts on here, and how helpful and giving those within the community have been, and it really warms my heart to know there are people like that out there in the world.  I'm wondering if there a chance someone would be willing to help me out as well. I'm a stay at home mom, raising my three little ones, Jason (6) and Michelle and Christina (both 3 1/2), while my husband works. Sadly, he lost his job about a year ago, and with this economy, he has only been able to pick up jobs here and there, and we're getting towards the end of our savings.  I would love to be able to sit down with a nice pizza dinner one night, and just be able to relax and enjoy the company of one another, that is, before the little ones start crying again. Pizza used to be a luxury purchase for us before, now it is almost impossible.  Anyone with a soft spot in their heart able to help out?  Thanks 
2775	True	a	Hi!  I'm an recent grad who just moved to Boston to start an independent game studio with two of my friends. Right now we are grinding out flash games [Examples](http://www.bored.com/game/play/151461/Stick_Save.html) to stay ahead of students loans and rent. I don't make much more money than rent here.  I've always heard how awesome and generous this Sub Reddit is, and now I am asking for help!  Help me RAoP your my only hope.  edit: Thank you laneage! :D 
2776	False	a	A university student cramming for exams, spend all my money on coffee and energy drinks to keep myself going! Could really use a pizza! Thanks in advance for everything! Can give proof of verification!
2777	True	a	"Alright...so, I'll try to keep it brief, not sure if I'm doing this right...I'm a grad student studying school psychology, I work as a fitness coach training the elderly to stay limber and healthy, I mentor, and I am currently working as a AmeriCorps member with United Way going out and meeting with parents and community members discussing how to get them more involved in their school.  On the weekends, I volunteer at an organic CSA farm and I'm getting getting ready to get married next summer.    Man, long story short reddit, I never eat out, but I just finished giving this brainiac an IQ test that took 3 hours and I would REALLY love to have some pizza...I'm broke (make less than minimum wage when my 2 ""jobs"" are averaged out) otherwise I'd just buy it myself.    I have beer, but no pizza.  I'm not gonna go hungry but...I've been up since 4:00 a.m. and I really need a pizza.  If I get a pizza I'll plant something for you at the farm :)  Thanks for your consideration!"
2778	True	a	Thanks yall!
2779	False	a	I work a manual labor job, and I'm so hungry right now.  This is my first time doing this, so if someone is willing to help me out, then I guess I'm supposed to do whatever you want, like show you a screenshot of my bank account balance or take a picture of a blue Dodge Neon or something.  All of you are the people that make RAOP go, so I leave it up to you, in good faith, to make me dance on whatever level is necessary.  I also give my word that after being paid tomorrow, I'll gladly help someone else out tomorrow night.
2780	False	a	I have no real need for pizza, except for the fact I'd like some for lunch. Lunch is at 3PM today. Help turn a craptastic day into an pizzatastic day :D
2781	True	a	So, I overdrew my account paying rent, and then I got the overdraft fee. So I'm like doubly overdrawn. I have training for a job on Saturday but like, payday won't be till Thursday. I have one thing of easy mac left in the cabinet, maybe some pasta, but man, I am so stressed out. Hook a stupid kid up with a cheese pizza? Would totally rock my weekend. If you wanted to go crazy, barbecue chicken pizza, but hey a large cheese pizza would feed me for a while, like 4 meals. I'm batting my eyelashes here. Thanks for hearing me out. 
2782	False	a	My roommate and i have fallen on some hard times lately, nothing to bad, mostly money problems. I spend a lot of time with my girlfriend, cooking for us most of the time at her house. I havent been the best friend to him lately, and i know he would really enjoy a piece of pie from some random stranger on the internet! Dang, just getting a bit choked up thinking about him getting a random pizza. Anyways, if anyone is up for a Random_Act_Of_Pizza, feel free to PM me! AMA you want, i will be here for a little while. EDIT: Roommate went for an interview this morning clear across town, used our last 14 dollars (change) to get him there. i know he would really enjoy a pizza today, if anyone is still around to send him one! Thanks again - 
2783	False	a	Hi there. My fiance and I are down on our luck in Las Vegas (and no, not from gambling, lol). I was the only breadwinner, and I got laid off last week. My unemployment money hasn't kicked in yet, and things are getting quite tight. Our fridge is down to that one jar of relish that everybody seems to have, some Taco Bell hot sauce packets, and some jelly, so I was hoping someone would be kind enough to help us out with a hot meal.   If there is a generous soul out there who sends us a pizza, I will certainly pay it forward once things turn around for us. Thanks so much for reading, I really appreciate it!
2784	False	a	Hey, my girlfriend has celiac disease and hasn't had a pizza in a long time. But today we found out that Domino's has gluten free pizza. I was wondering if anyone would be nice enough to order me one for her.  Thanks!
2785	False	a	Just looking to get some pizza tonight. Have no cash, and no food right now. Completely flat broke until Friday, but I will pay forward as soon as I get paid. :) If there's anything else I can do, just let me know.
2786	False	a	Hey y'all,  I'm a college kid in Conway, Arkansas who's pretty broke at the moment. I'm cool with ramen, but I'd be even cooler with some pizza, since my school cafeteria, for whatever stupid reason, doesn't serve dinner on Saturdays. Hmph.  Anyway, as stated in the title, I will definitely sing you a song in exchange for such a wonderful act of feeding me! And I promise to share the pizza with my roommate, because I'm a nice lady. ;D
2787	False	a	Hi!, I'm from around the GTA in Ontario, Canada- I was recommended by a internet friend that I could maybe receive a pizza here..  My fridge broke down about a week plus ago ( I live in an apartment complex )  Anyways, I found this out much later than I should have.. and all my food spoiled. It's near the end of the month, and I wasn't prepared to face this type of problem.. Only have a $1.46 in my bank account right now, and I'm trying to tide over with a can of beans and an expired bag of popcorn until the 1st of next month hits..  Anyways, thanks for reading my thing; and I hope you have a good day!
2788	False	a	I didn't know a place like this exists!   I was out sick for 3 days the week before Labour Day. After my manager came back, I was let go at the end of my shift. I was supposed to be paid my last pay(big whopping 7.5 hours of pay) on Friday that just passed, and of course, they didn't pay me and said that'd be another week before I'll get my final check from them. I start at a new job tomorrow but won't be paid until October 4th and that money all goes right into rent.   I just would love to eat pizza and watch Breaking Bad tonight as if everything was normal. 
2789	False	a	So I just moved out to Denver for a job that I then lost (was hard working with some of the other employees, and the company was going in a bad design direction).  I was lucky enough to get another job within a week but i'm now between paychecks.  I have $100 on the Envato Market place I can exchange for pizza.  I'll double the cost of the pizza in return.      If you don't know about Envato, they run these amazing sites:     http://themeforest.net/ - Really nice website and wordpress themes.     http://codecanyon.net/  - PHP scripts/classes and WordPress plugins, jQuery and Javascript stuff.     http://audiojungle.net/ - Music and sound fx for movie or game production.       http://videohive.net/   - After Effects projects scenes and other video assets.     among others you can navigate to from any of their sites.   I make money selling items on CodeCanyon but they pay out on the 15th once a month.  I'll purchase any item or items you want up to around $60 ( so around $30 in pizza ), how much is up to you.   I would much rather have pizza than hamburger helper without any hamberger (hamberger is expensive you know).
2790	False	a	I love reading Wired, but this is something else.
2791	True	a	Long story short;   Stuff happened.  I'm all tapped out, and have no family or friends to ask for help.  Local pantry isn't until first week of June and by then, I'll be back in the way positive again.  Come Friday, I'll have 3 paychecks.  Figure the luck on that.    Please!  Having nothing to eat/drink but water and it sucks.
2792	False	a	Proof [Here] (http://imgur.com/JYsNU).  It's been a rough month honestly- I have my girlfriend in from out of town and literally have nothing but noodles to make for dinner (and as fantastic as garlic butter noodles go- they get old very VERY quickly). I'd love it if someone could get us a pizza- I don't have any cash coming in until late next week and it would be an excellent birthday present. 
2793	False	a	Hey RAoP, long time lurker, first time poster here. My bank account has $2.78 in it, and my car is on E. Meaning that I can't drive home this weekend to celebrate the Super Bowl with my family, and I'll be eating canned soup again tonight. I already had that for lunch and I would really love a pizza. My loans come in next Monday (they would have come in sooner but the Fin Aid office screwed something up). I'll gladly return the favor if you help me out tonight! Also, I just aced my Income Tax test that's I've been studying for all week, and last week I made a 98 on my managerial accounting test! :)
2794	False	a	Hey friends!  I just moved to Kansas City three weeks ago and I was recently fired from my job, serving at a movie theatre, but I quickly got a job serving at a local restaurant.  Unfortunately, I have to wait a bit for my paycheck, and I've had -.87 cents in my account since last Saturday.  Just a small cheese pizza would be ridiculously appreciated. 
2795	False	a	Today is my birthday and I'm looking at $5 to last me until next Thursday. I would be super happy if I could have a tasty meal. : )
2796	False	a	I'd love a pizza for my birthday. I'm not going out anywhere and I have my two children who'd like some too. I don't have a car and the only place that delivers is Dominos. Thank you for reading, even if you can't donate! 
2797	False	a	Simple as that.  I'd love to eat something other than raman and can return the favor when I get a job.  Going searching today, wish me luck!  Edit:  Thanks, Causeimgb!
2798	False	a	I get paid Wednesday, but ran out of food yesterday.  I'm not sure exactly how this works, but I figured I'd give it a try because, well, I'm getting pretty hungry.  It doesn't have to be much, but I would really appreciate a little help to get me through until Wednesday.  Thank you.
2799	False	a	I don't get paid until Wednesday, and my sister and I are reeling from the fact that we just found out our biological father lost his fight with cancer this morning. A pizza or 2 would be a welcome. Have a good week.  EDIT: forgot to put [request] in the title the first time. Maybe that's why it didn't show up on the subreddit...
2800	False	a	pretty broke, n hungry.  Thanks if you can help!
2801	False	a	Lentil soup gets a little old. I grocery shop on a budget of 5 bucks a day. lol
2802	True	a	Here's a post about the break-in: http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1cjhxc/heres_my_brave_dog_dumbledore_hes_four_years_old/  Thanks if you can help in any way! I was looking at a few of the request threads, and when I saw the pizza it started a craving I guess :) you guys do amazing work!  I get off at 4:30pm EST so I don't know if there's a way to pre-schedule them or something? And I can pick it up as well to save extra costs!
2803	False	a	So it turns out a Journalism course needs good grades in English, who knew!
2804	False	a	The title pretty much sums it up, but my friend's in town for a few days before he gets deployed to South Korea for a year. Tonight's the goodbye party for him and his girlfriend, who's moving to Pennsylvania for school. I'm from out of town and spent all my money on gas driving up to see them, and the party host spent all his money on the booze. Anyway, if anyone would be willing to support our army hero with a pizza, we would appreciate and pay it forward when we're able. :]  EDIT: Should probably mention that we're in the Coeur d'Alene, ID/Spokane, WA area.
2805	True	a	Waiting for payday a few days away and due to bills being a bit higher then expected having to live off pb and j until pay day. Would love to share a pizza or two with family to have something else on our taste buds til then. Would be more then happy to return the favor after payday, and as much as I hate asking for help would love to lift our spirits up a bit! Thanks in advance!
2806	False	a	One of those pay the bills or eat situations until I start my new job next week and get paid in three weeks. :(
2807	False	a	I've never asked and I've never pizza'd. I would love a pizza for lunch...um, I have no sob story. I'm unemployed? Does that help?
2808	False	a	"So... long story short, I'm crashing at my mother's because I'm moving back to this area for a new job I start tomorrow. We don't get along all that great, especially when it comes to food things. She had a pack of burger patties and a pack of brats in her freezer, which I thawed, but apparently am not allowed to cook because ""it would stink up the house"" and offend her quasi-vegetarian ""I don't eat mammals"" sensibilities. Nor is there any other readily available food in the house, and I'm broke pending employment and will be saving every scrap to get into an apartment ASAP..."
2809	False	a	US Army soldier broke and all the dining facilities are closed. Haven't eaten anything in 24 hours due to being on shift, and could really use a pizza right about now. 
2810	False	a	Just like the title says. Paycheck didn't come in because of bad weather and I'm hungry, pizza me tonight and you will be repaid! Scouts honor!  
2811	False	a	This isn't for me but I have a friend who is in need but isn't a redditor. (That I know of). He became unemployed a couple weeks ago and he has barely enough food to keep his weight up. I am broke as hell and can't help him at the moment. All I have to offer is I will help someone at some future date in need.
2812	True	a	I'm in the US. Money is super tight and my soon to be 2 yr old keeps asking for pizza (peet-zee). Her b-day is tomorrow (9/27) and i'd really like to surprise her with some pizza. I can provide cell phone pics of my family (2 toddlers, 2 adults) eating the pizza afterward. :D  EDIT: Recieved an egiftcard thanks hearip88!
2813	False	a	And I'd really like a pizza -- something of real sustenance to put into my belly before my first day of work on Monday would be nice.   Planning a wedding? I worked in a copy center for several years and would love to give advice for printing and pricing.  Like music? I DJ and would love to create a mix of your favorite EDM genre in your honor :3!!!!!!  Thanks in advance my pizza heroes =^-^=!
2814	False	a	"Hey ROOP, I recently was ""let go"" from my job, after asking for a month and a half to be scheduled more than 6 hours every two weeks. I've been searching for a job for the duration of this slow, twisted screw-over, but have had no luck. I will receive *some* unemployment, but it will not come in for another two weeks, provided my last employer doesn't somehow convince the state to also screw me over. It's been an unusually rough patch in my life, and I'll spare you the details of everything else, but I'm 3,000 miles from my family and they're too broke with medical bills to help.   Would anyone be so kind as to order me a pizza and feed me for a few days?  Much love, Preston"
2815	False	a	I live in the Twin-Cities area (MN). If you buy me a pizza, I promise to but a pizza for another redditor once i get paid.
2816	False	a	Freaking on my way home my tire pressure light came on and pulled into my dealer. Figuring that they just needed to put some air in a tire was expecting to be in and out. Two hours later i have to drop over $200 that wiped out my bank account, and now I'm home with an empty fridge and hungry. Any help would be awesome : ) 
2817	False	a	If this works, I will buy someone else a pizza next week.
2818	False	a	I'm stuck at home and broke.  Just thought I would give this a shot.
2819	True	a	Hello. I have received once before in an offer post. I'm humbly asking again if someone could assist us with a pizza. We just got back from swimming practice and we're pretty hungry. We have some buttered noodles to hold us over, but we're pretty sick of those.   :P    Thank you. 
2820	False	a	Hi stranger, my friends and I are working late in the office tonight. If you send us some pizza you'll make some interns really happy tonight :)  Also, we live in Singapore. :)
2821	True	a	**Edit:**  I received a gift card from a fellow redditor.  Thank you so much for the generosity!  I will definitely pay it forward when I get a chance.  I was out of state for a semester of school and returned a few weeks ago.  I was finally offered a job on Friday but I still have to wait for background checks to go through before I can officially start next week (or so).  I'm babysitting my nieces for my brother who happens to work at a dealership across from my apartment so any food will go towards feeding the girls and my brother as well.  My brother is also trying to get back on his feet as well after a divorce so he is unable to pay me for watching the kids.  Now, after that sob story, I will say we are not DYING for food.  If you find someone else in greater need, by all means help them first.  Food would greatly help me save money until I officially start my job, considering I still have to wait another 2-3 weeks for a paycheck to come in.  If I do receive any food, I definitely plan to pay it forward once I am more financially stable.    This turned out a whole lot longer than I planned.  I would appreciate any help. Thanks!
2822	False	a	Things are looking down for me. No job and no money mean i will have to move out of my place. Trying to keep my head up as much as possible. I could really go for some pizza to keep me going.
2823	False	a	we don't have anything to eat anywhere in the house at all and need a hot meal to feed us.and the our car's gas tank is leaking at the bottom of the tank so when we put gas in it it comes right back out the bottom of the tank so we went and bought a new one and nobody to put it on right now and my wifes been in and out of the er almost every day with asthma attacks and we need some help with food please and thank you so much.
2824	False	a	We could really use some pizza. Live in suffolk NY  Thank you.
2825	False	a	Let's be honest, who wants to leave the house with an ace bandage around their head and stitches that look like spiders on their face?   I had surgery on my neck Tuesday, and my neck and face are covered in bruises. I've managed to stay inside for since then, and hope a few more days will help with the situation.   I don't mind sending a verification pic of the bruising to any of you kind folks, and hope to return the kindness of yummies sometime soon.  Thank you for taking  the time to look, either way!  Edit: Took the bandages off for a moment, stitches and bruises ahoy! http://i.imgur.com/vpO54ZD.jpg
2826	True	a	The fianc√© and I are short on rent and food. I just got a second job, but no pay check for two weeks. And he just started a third job that pays once a month. Please may we have our favorite food for dinner?
2827	True	a	It would be much appreciated, and payed forward later on. 
2828	False	a	ok, so heres the sitch, i quit my job a month ago, i had money set aside for rent and such, but it took longer than i thought to find a job. i now have a job but wont get my first paycheck for about a week. i have no food and havent ate all day. if you read this and think i deserve a pizza let me know. thanks
2829	False	a	Hello folks, figure I'd give this a shot considering my current circumstances.  Now I know I'm not as bad off as a lot of the folks around here but I figure what little help I could get will be appreciated.  Without going into to much detail of my life I'll keep this short.  Before I head overseas I decided to move my family back to where our family is.  The home buying and moving (on my dime) process has dragged on longer than expected and that has cost us more money than budgeted because of the delay.. I have enough money to put fuel back in the tank and right now we are eating basically what we packed out of our pantry.  We have to last little less than a week and we'll be good.  I have a couple of older boys with me and I'm sure they'd also appreciate some pizza about now...  Thanks in advance and it feels good be get back home to Oregon....
2830	False	a	I've been living off bologna sandwiches and ramen for the past few months, and all I can think about is getting a hot slice of pizza. No sad stories, just a big craving. Thanks!
2831	True	a	There's 5 of us and all we can afford is Ramen. :(
2832	False	a	I had knee surgery, and I've been wanting pizza. I was hoping I could win a contest but it's been a no go. I just really want some pizza. Oh and I can't go anywhere because I'm on percocet, kind of sucks ha ha.
2833	False	a	http://i42.tinypic.com/ngr32v.jpg  tell me that didnt make you laugh!   this is so relevant right now hahaha  i really want to order a pizza pepperonis, green peppers, onions, ham, and extra cheese  all the toppings needed to make the pizza i am fantasizing about  omgggggg   ):  my heart will be yours, completely if you blessed me with some 'za &lt;3 
2834	True	a	I recently graduated from UC San Diego with a BA in theater and now I'm trying to break into the industry in LA. I've been here for 6 months now and have had some luck with odd jobs, but no steady work. A pizza for my GF and I would be greatly appreciated.
2835	True	a	I am having crazy pizza pangs right now. However, between me and getting pizza are some annoying circumstances! I am not picky about what kind of pizza. So if anyone could please help me fill this crazy craving my belly is torturing me with, I'll forever be grateful, and I will be sure to pay it forward as soon as I'm able!   Edit: It looks like I have won a contest for a $10 pizza gift card!!   Thank you /u/CH31415 for the _$20_ Papa John's gift card! You are awesome!! 
2836	False	a	Hi raop'ers, I'm a bit hungry and I just thought I'd try this out and see if I get lucky. Thanks :)
2837	False	a	I tried posting on here last night but it doesn't look like my post made it onto the site. Rather than write it all out again I'll sum it up as best I can.  My hubby of nearly ten years spent the money my mother gave us for food on beer and cigarettes, so since last night he's been booted out of the house by yours truly. Not sure when I'll let him back in but I intend to stay mad for quite a while. It got down into the 40's last night so I reckon he's definitely regretting his decision about now.  Thankfully he at least got food for the dog so that's one less thing to worry about, but I don't get paid until Monday and that money was supposed to help us make it to then. Right now my fridge is barren, all I have is half a jar of really old pickles.  I ended up taking the day off work today. I'm hungry, angry, upset, not really good for much of anything. I need something to eat, hopefully something that will last a day or two or three. Monday is quite a ways to go without something in my stomach.
2838	True	a	We both work but it's still paycheck to paycheck. I sold an item on ebay to get some extra cash but since it was an awkward item to ship(giant plush lady and the tramp dog), it jacked the shipping from $30 to $58, I had to pay the $28 out of pocket since I told the buyer it would be only $30. So that sapped our funds until we get paid tomorrow. Until then, we starve as we have nothing at the house to eat. Not trying to give a sob story, just being honest.  But hey if we got a pizza, maybe the wife would stop bragging about pinterest :-)
2839	False	a	Hi everyone,   I'm completely out of cash and won't be paid until Monday from work. I'm currently studying neuroscience and hope to help the world one day. Would definitely appreciate some help from the world tonight.  Note: I don't have a paypal, but dominos/papa john's e-gift cards work great.
2840	True	a	I have an awsome neighbor who's a single dad of 3 (under the age of 9) he lost his job 3 weeks ago.  I help him out when I can with food for the kids, but I'm a single mom myself, so I can't keep it up much longer. He's been eating Ramen noodles for the past 2 days, he's a great guy, going out there applying for jobs, unfortunately going through a rough time lately!! Please help lift his spirts! Thanks!!
2841	False	a	I just moved into a new apartment, and I'm really strapped for cash until the end of this week, when my new job starts up. Not only that, but school will be starting in 2 weeks, and I'm sure once that happens I won't get the chance to relax a whole lot either. I'll be sure to pay if forward once I get some money, as well, so I'm not being a total bum. Thanks!
2842	False	a	Hi guys! As the title reads, don't have any food at the moment, just finished eating all the old bacon for breakfast and my bank account is sitting at 22 cents till tomorrow.  http://imgur.com/JwUFDLc  I'm also playing FFXIV: A Realm Reborn, IGN: Perez Hilton, Server: Cactuar !!  Thanks,  Chris
2843	True	a	Hey RAoP, I feel bad even asking for this, but I've ran into a bit of a pinch. I recently lost my job, and my mother and brother-in-law had to come to stay with us until after the holidays due to losing their heat. Unfortunately we don't have the means to feed everyone. After going to get them because they have no car, we had to use what little money we had for gas. Thanks in advance! 
2844	True	a	I havent eaten all day, I would love to eat something tonight. First time requester, please be nice :)?
2845	False	a	Hey people well yea i was with my ex one night and to be honest she kinda sorta little bit raped me. I know, how can a guy get raped? WELL IT HAPPEN K! And after two months of waiting, mother nature answered my prayers! I would really like to celebrate this and I've never gotten a pizza through this before, but I promise if I receive a pizza I will give someone a pizza in the future as well! Thanks everyone! If i do miraculously get chosen I shall pm my details.  [Bill Murray demonstrating how I feel](http://imgur.com/V2NRn)  edit: just found out though i have to work tomorrow from 12 to 1 am...... yay... 
2846	False	a	So here is my story. I am 21 years of age and have studied music at the University of Arkansas for 2 and a half years. Last sememster I Decided to change majors and it cost me so much in scholarships that I cannot afford school Anylonger. I figured I would work for a semester, maybe a year, then go back to school and keep moving forward. Well I work at a video game store and I love it. The one problem is that I am having to PAyfor things that I usually didn't have to before. So while struggling I decided to consider the military. I did a lot of research and am now deciding between the Marines and the Army. I want to join the Marines but I am keeping my options open until I get as much info as I can. I am going to be moving back in with my parents next month in order to try to save some money but until then I have been living off of granola bars and the occasional ramen. I've had to sell my video games and musical instruments to pay rent and such and have to pay for gas in change most if the time. Anyways thank you for your time.   TL;DR: struggling hungry dude moving in with parents in order to survive till joining the military.  P.S. this whole thing was typed on an iPhone so sorry for any errors.
2847	False	a	I'm not starving or anything, so if someone else posts with a much more dire situation than me, I'd encourage you to send pizza to them. I'm just hungry and have been craving pizza for the past few days, but haven't had any pocket money. That's all. (:
2848	True	a	Not needy, I just looove me some pizza. 19/F weighing in at a whopping 90 pounds and I have to gain *at least* 6 pounds before I leave for basic training (Air Force) on December 13th. Of course I'll gain the weight no matter what, but pizza certainly wouldn't hurt.  [Here is a picture](http://i.imgur.com/EJXAG.png) of my dog as a puppy to further entice you. Beaver's the name.
2849	True	a	hello fellow redditers. i am seeking assistance in the form of food for tonight. Today was rent, and after paying rent, and sending in a check for utilities, I am once again broke. I don't want to bore you with my details, but I am asking for a pizza to help ride out this recession.
2850	False	a	I'm a stay at home mom with my 2 year old son. I have a boyfriend that works 12 hours a week for basically nothing half the time. He's having a hard time keeping food on the table. I wouldn't ask if I really didn't need it. But I have warn the supply I had in my cabinets down to nothing. I just need a little help please. I will give you any proof you need. I will even pay it forward some how when I can. Thank you for reading.  [EDIT] My boyfriend made enough money last night to buy us some groceries for a few days. So as much as I appreciate you guys offering I no longer need it. I couldn't in good conscious take a pizza I dont really need. Specially since there are so many people on here that need food. Thank you so much for offering, it really makes me smile that their are some awesome people out there willing to help a stranger. I hope that if I ever need help again that I will be as lucky to find people with hearts like yours! &lt;3
2851	False	a	I'm 33 years old and I've been unemployed for 18 months. Most of the new jobs in my hometown of Tullahoma, TN, are far beyond my reach of experience (i.e., medical jobs like registered nurses, etc.). I live with my parents and obviously times have been tough on all of us. My dad works a job he hates but has to stick with it so we can have money to live on;my mom is disabled and can't work. Most of the time we have to rely on local churches to help pay our bills and put gas in our car. While a pizza would definitely raise my spirits it would do the same for my parents. I hate seeing them suffer like this as I get turned down for new jobs. Needless to say times are becoming tougher for my family because the money is running out quickly. So please help me put a smile on my parents' faces for at least one day. That way they know someone out there is watching out for us. :)
2852	True	a	My mom recently had major back surgery for a car accident she had years ago, and was in recovery when she contracted MRSA (Blood infection immune to oral antibiotics) and she has to give herself antibiotics through an IV line with a syringe every day. She also has a home health care nurse come in every day and Pack her surgical wound and push out any infectious puss that might build up. It's a pretty painful process. Her injury in the accident came right after she got her Commercial Driver's License and was about to become a truck driver, now she can't work at all. We're extremely low on food until our food stamps come in. My mom's Doctor's our pressuring her to gain weight or they're going to put her in a nursing home. She only weighs 85 pounds, and it would be amazing if a friendly Redditor helped us out.
2853	True	a	    Pizza: round and hot.     Craving cheese and meat? A lot!     Send one? It's a thought...  EDIT: It all appeared on one line, so I fixed it.
2854	False	a	I just finalized my enlistment in the US Air Force, and I'd love to celebrate with my fiancee/soon-to-be-wife. Alas, my bank account is running on fumes. Would anyone care to help us out tonight?  I'm in eastern Los Angeles County; I have Pizza Hut, Dominos, and Papa Johns near me. I have a verification code, too!
2855	False	a	I'm a broke post-college student. There's nothing to eat here and I'm been hoping for a pizza pie all day long. Stomach is really starting to grumble! It's my birthday soon, and I'll pay it forward by giving someone a pizza at the end of next week with money from that!  There is a great place just down the road from me that makes awesome pizza, PLEASE help me out!  
2856	False	a	Update: She woke up, I'm cooking dinner. Butter chicken &amp; rice. No pizza needed anymore. Thanks for the kind wishes all!  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Came home from group to a girlfriend who has cried herself to sleep because her friends have bailed on plans with her again. Hell, one of them has bailed on treating her like a human being anymore in general.  I want to have a treat for her when she wakes, but we're running on empty money-wise. She loves pizza with chicken and bacon on it, but if that can't happen, I'll start cooking for her as soon as she wakes up - just don't want to make any noise right now and wake her up because she actually looks peaceful (although puffy-eyed from crying).
2857	False	a	Yea..  This was a new job that I really enjoyed after 3 months of unemployment and filling applications. Rent's paid, thank goodness, but I've already promised the power company my paycheck (and then some). I've got some food to last me the end of the week but just don't want to start the ramen already. I could use a pizza for dinner tonight, guys, and a smile. 2012's been rough.
2858	False	a	Hey all! Pay Day is a few days away, and I've suddenly got a hankering for pizza. If anyone is willing to help I would be eternally greatful!
2859	False	a	I've been underemployed for a few months now, and just barely making it. Today I got a full time job offer, and I'm really excited! Would love to celebrate this with a pizza!
2860	False	a	Hey guys, my friend just told me about this and I'm starving and don't know when I'll have money or food again. I just started working and all my last check went to bills and gas to get to work. I'm a type I diabetic who's in some need of food, and a pizza would be amazing right now.  I'm willing to play some Team Fortress, Killing Floor, or anything else (as long as I have the game lol) w/ anyone who helps!  Thanks in advance! =)  
2861	False	a	My landlord double-leased the apartment we were staying in, resulting in them showing up last Thursday morning to kick us out. We disputed and proved our lease wasn't until up until the 31st of August, but they did everything in their power to get us out early. They're supposed to refund our unused rent and give us a little extra, but there's no telling when we'll see that check. We've spent every dime we have moving into a new place; deposit, first and last month's rent, getting utilities turned on, etc. really adds up. We're looking at an empty pantry and totally bummed. If someone could get us a pizza for tonight we'd be incredibly grateful.
2862	False	a	How's everyone doing tonight?
2863	False	a	Not sure how this whole thing works but I do tech support from my house and today is that day of the month (Not a women, in regards to food) were rent is paid but I am with out cash until I get paid. I will return the favor, I promise.
2864	False	a	I'll try to keep this short and to the point. I just recently moved, I'm broke, my car is giving me issues, and a mess of other stuff. I'm in a great mood right now though! A pizza would just send me over the top. If you really just want to make a dumb kid (I'm in my 20's) happy, I'm your guy. Thanks a lot. If you want any more info you can message me.
2865	False	a	I'm in Australia (Sydney) and am v hungry! I've opened my own counselling/psychotherapy business which I'm so passionate about. I love helping people. This has meant that I've spent all my money. I'm sure it will all be worth it but in the meantime I'm scraping by on next to no money.  I've finally been on Reddit for a month which I think makes me eligible.    I too would love to take part in offering pizza once I'm financially on my feet again.   Thank you so much to who ever even considers feeding me!
2866	False	a	Any help will do! Thanks!
2867	False	a	FORGOT TO PUT LOCATION - RHODE ISLAND  So there are three of us living here. Two adult males, and an adult female.  Somehow our finances were completely drained this month. no food, no money, paycheck isn't coming until the second, and we're apparently too rich for food pantries.  Our resident artist has said she will draw anything you like, and our resident... something has said he will thank you profusely as he has no discernable skills that can be applied to the internet. (he's really good at RPGs. doesnt help here.)  Now there are a thousand pity stories all over the4 internet, so we decided to add a bit of proof. Pics of bank account, fridge, etc.  http://i50.tinypic.com/28iw93n.jpg http://i46.tinypic.com/dbnjac.jpg http://i49.tinypic.com/2637kw3.jpg and yes this says we're 0.75 cents in the red.  http://i46.tinypic.com/xo08j4.jpg
2868	False	a	My boyfriend had to go to the ER a few days ago and I got behind on laundry so I'm already going to have to turn on the dryer and heat the house up more. We have a portable AC in one room but it's working hard today and I'm still rather miserable. I also had my first encounter with morning sickness this morning and I hate touching/looking/smelling raw meat lately so a nice pizza that I dont have to turn the oven on for sounds so great right now. Thanks for reading/considering!
2869	False	a	"I recently turned 18 and graduated from high school and I'm a YouTuber.  Currently, being apart of the partner program does not bring in that much (a few cents a day) and I'm having my first scripting meeting with some other content creators.  Money is tight and it would be much appreciated if someone could help feed the brains of a couple of teens working on their passion.  P.S.  I'll list you in credits for ""Executive Producer"".  It's Star Wars related.  In fact, I just finished learning lightsaber FX (finally), I'll link the video testing.  [VIDEO](http://youtu.be/TD6JiAJzXRM)  "
2870	False	a	I'm just a student with (apparently) terrible money management, but I have no monies or food :( A pizza would be much appreciated!
2871	False	a	Hi, first timer here! I'm down to my last $10, waiting for some good news later next week. My job, home and girlfriend all fell away in the past couple of months, and I have little else left. I could really use some help; a pizza would give me 2 days of good eating, maybe even enough for the whole weekend. I'm in Manila, Philippines. Pizza can be ordered online from yellowcabpizza.com.  Sincere thanks!
2872	False	a	One day at a time, starting to climb out of some dark times. Would love a pizza to anywhere, if anyone can help I'll absolutely pay it back or forward next week!  Thanks!
2873	False	a	I have no more money after paying the bills and I have little food in my house. Please help! Thanks. :)
2874	True	a	Its kinda hard to ask....I and my wife and 3 kids need a little help.  I lost my job and even though I got another one I dont get paid till next friday. We have been living off anything we can get.  A friend told me about this from tv. I figured I would give it a shot. Not sure how it works.  I would love to feed my kids and wife a decent meal tonight. I am not asking for charity just....well a little food.  I will return the gesture. cowman31@hotmail.com   If you need any other info feel free to email me  
2875	False	a	So finally moved out and after paying first and last I'm kind of short on cash. Last of my money went on groceries which didn't last too long. Waiting on my next pay check (Friday).   Unfortunately didn't have much for saving because I went to summer school to get some extra credits.  I am willing to repay the favor Friday and provide my non throw away account :]. Normally I'd use my actual account but I don't want to let me friends or family know that I'm in a bit of a financial situation until my next pay check.   Thank you in advance :]
2876	False	a	Fellow Floridian Redditors,  I'm coming to you all with my hat in hand, looking for a bit of help.  I'm way down on my luck, hoping to catch a break for once.  I've been working construction in the hot Florida heat for the past 4 months, and have made a total of $958, before taxes.  I've been forced to move back in with my parents, something I swore I'd never do.  I'm sad, depressed, sunburned as hell, tired and praying for some generosity.  If anyone out there has it in their heart to help out a guy who has been busting his butt to make ends meat, I'd truly appreciate it.
2877	False	a	Just go home from work (started at 4am) and have to do it again tomorrow.  Too exhausted to cook and if I did it would take too long to make and clean up as I need to go to bed soon to get up again for my shift tomorrow.  Help feed me for the week.  Please.  I'll be so grateful and pay it forward when I can.&lt;3
2878	False	a	Pulling an all nighter looking for some pizza. Any food at all would be much appreciated. Thanks 
2879	False	a	My life isn't particularly terrible or anything, but I'm spending from now until tuesday buried in books and essays preparing for next weeks finals, and that's just no fun. I have $5 left for the semester, but it's gonna need to be spent on 7/11 coffee to get me through. I'd love a pizza for morale and just to be done with my stockpile of microwave bagel bites (even though they were amazing about 15 boxes ago.)  I'm a big fan of Dominos, but obviously, anything would be more than appreciated.  Also, when school's out and I'm back home, it will be easier to come by money and I would love to return the favor.  Thanks in advance, and hell thanks for anyone who has given on this subreddit, just for being a kickass person.
2880	True	a	Hello.  I've been subsisting on tip money for the past couple of days, but I had to quit my job this morning because my manager threatened to fire me if I did not take an 18 hour shift (right after 4 hours of sleep from a 12 hour shift!). I had been working as a cook for a sports bar type place for a week and a half, but I have yet to receive my first paycheck. I quit because I cannot work for a place that does not respect the schedule, forcing me to work unannounced overtime that is often more than the scheduled time itself. I've already filled out applications to 5 places, so I am sure I'll be fine. I'll get my paycheck in the mail on Friday or Saturday, too.  About me: 19, EMS student &amp; highschool grad who no longer has tip money to carry him day to day. I moved back in with my mom from my grandparents house. My grandparents are well-off, but my mother is unemployed and gets food bill from the grandparents. She is visiting my aunt and uncle in Canada this week, so no food bill for me until Sunday. :(  What I can give in return: If I give you my Papa John's credentials, you can order just a $10 pizza to my door and I will have earned 1 free large pizza from their loyalty program. :D I can either eat it myself or send it back to you! 2 for the price of 1! I can also chat with you about science, academics, or just politics or really whatever you'd like to talk about. We can connect on Tumblr or Facebook if you like :3
2881	False	a	Hey all, student in southern California here, and I'm pretty short on cash for now. I've been limiting myself to a meal of macaroni/ramen a day to save some money. A 'za would be pretty bomb-diggity right now, as would be the kind person who might lend me a hand in this scenario. Much gratitude to anyone who considers -- I'm hoping one day I'll be the one in a position to give out pizzas here. Thanks for reading.
2882	True	a	I just got hired on as a member of Geek Squad at Best Buy, however I have to wait two weeks for my first check! My roommate and I are low on funds until tomorrow, any chance we could get some assistance today, and then Tag my post I will give with a pie with my first check! 
2883	False	a	Just down on my luck, couple of rough things happened including losing my job.
2884	False	a	I'm a happy college student trying to study for orgo, but knowing that wont happen, I'm willing to paint you guys a picture using, get this, GLOW-IN-THE-MOTHER-F***ING-DARK paint. So ill draw you something in exchange for pizza!
2885	False	a	I graduated at the end of June and only just now found a job. It's an amazing opportunity and I'd like to celebrate with my SO but as of right now we are completely broke. 
2886	False	a	Pizza Pizza. Sitting at my computer watching my eyes turn red in the reflection. HELP PLEASE
2887	False	a	Louisiana native here. My bike broke down and I had to spend money to get it repaired at my shop... that being said, I'm broke now. I don't get paid until Wednesday so a pizza would really help keep me from going hungry for the next 3 days. 
2888	False	a	My husband and I are expecting our first baby after struggling to conceive. Yesterday we had our first ultrasound and it went AMAZING! We heard the heartbeat and it was magical.   Would just love to not have to cook supper for us and to celebrate a great day with a pizza since it's pouring rain here.
2889	False	a	So me and my bro are wanting to live up the last day in town before we separate for college. Unfortunately, because of this we are all broke. All of our refrigerators have been cleaned out and we are desperate for food. It would be REALLY awesome if our last meal together was payed by the Interwebs and we will forever grateful. Thank You.
2890	False	a	I'm going to be home the next day and a half. It'd make my weekend if someone had a pizza delivered to me at some random moment. I live around Albany, NY.  Given one, willing to pay forward.
2891	False	a	i don't know what words to put here  (posted in the fork sub by mistake)
2892	False	a	Hey there, I am going hungry and would really appreciate a pizza from anyone willing. I'll give a little story about what has led me to be extremely poor (¬£9 to last until the end of August).  I went to university this year, and moved out of my parent's home to forge a new life in Peckham, which is when everything started going horribly wrong. I hated my course, the people on my course seemingly went out of their way to make me feel uncomfortable (I'm quite shy, and very insecure).  For years now, I've been fighting my demons, keeping them just below the surface - I've always felt like I was just about floating, reading to sink at any moment. Around Christmas, I did just that - sank like a stone. I fell into a major depressive episode that last months, culminating in what I can only describe as a mental breakdown over Easter. I became dependent on weed, never leaving my room or spending time sober other than to go to work on Sundays, and then I'd come home and get high again. Obviously, I dropped out of university.  This, obviously, was a massive waste of money. It also didn't help that I'd lent one of my now ex-housemates ¬£100 to help him pay his rent, which I know now that I will never see again (we live and learn). I have a ¬£970 overdraft that is all gone, and although I've at least paid my rent for this month, I won't be getting paid until the end of August. I also have to pay a week worth of council tax (only ¬£30 but too much for me) for the week before I enrolled, or I'll have a court date, and ¬£40 of library fees tomorrow, but luckily my mum is bailing me out for that (she already bailed me out of last month's rent, so I already owe her ¬£500).  I've had to start working full time, eat butter sandwiches at work because it is all I can afford, and improvise for dinner (or just not eat). I'm extremely skinny anyway, and cannot afford this weight loss.  I spend four hours commuting a day (I work in West London), come home, eat, sleep, get up at 6am to go to work again...I feel very lonely at the moment, and a cheesy, greasy pizza with meat or something would go a long way to providing me with a little comfort at the moment.  Sorry for spilling this all out, I only meant to give a short sum out, but have ended up providing you with an essay! I'm not known for being concise...  But yes, a pizza would be so very appreciated, and if the offerer wanted, I can return the pizza favour once I get paid. I would just like some meat and cheese in my life right now haha. Thanks for listening &lt;3
2893	True	a	"So I had an ex-roommate who owed me a portion of the deposit from our last place, and I stupidly gave him my bank info so he could wire the funds to me. Note: I used to have a wells fargo account so thats how we used to transfer funds easily for rent etc... but I moved and found it easier to use a schwab account since they refund atm fees and having a brokerage account all in one was nice for when I wanted to start trading.   He took this and then basically managed to create an e-check to citi to pay for a credit bill. Why the fuck citi decided hey lets accept a check from a random person to cover another persons bill I will never know. Schwab didn't stop it in time so it took out a good chunk of my checking account before I noticed what had happened. After spending hours on the phone over this last week with the fraud dept, I was told that they would create a new checking account for me and transfer my remaining funds, but that my debit card would remain active.  Today I'm at a gas station trying to fill up when my card doesn't go through. I call and found out there is nothing they can do it to link my old card with my new account and that they have to send me a new card, which wont be here till monday. So I had to spend my last 10 dollars in cash to get enough gas just get home. (If you don't now how schwab works can't walk into a branch and just withdraw money, you have to use your debit card at an atm, thats why they refund the fees) Now to add to all of this when I was younger I messed up my credit pretty badly, and I have been working to fix it recently but its still not good enough to get a credit card without just getting raped on fees. So basically I have no acces to any money at all until my new checks or debit card arrives.   Also being a single guy during finals I didn't really stock up the fridge that well, so I am standing infront of my fridge/pantry to see that I only have 5 eggs, 7 slices of bacon (the one thing that may keep me sane lol), a little oatmeal and lots of moldy veggies left. Now I could stretch what I have l easily for 2ish days, but that still leaves me short tonight and tomorrow. I normally am not the kind of person to ask for a handout but if anyone could help me during this perfect shitstorm that would be make my week. The second I have access to my accounts and money again I plan on passing it along.   TL;DR: I got fucked by my ex-roomate. To ""protect"" me schwab locked all my accounts while telling me I would still be able to use them. So i've got no money till monday and am just short of food to make it till then.  edit: never done this so forgive me. forgot to add that im in the san diego area  edit2: RZF291 is a scholar and a gentlemen! Thank you so much again!"
2894	True	a	"Let me start by saying that this site is incredible.  First of all, it's encouraging to see so many wonderful people out there helping each other.  That's just magical.  The other side of that is while I'm not glad to know there are others going through what I'm going through, I am glad to know that I'm not alone.  I think that's probably the hardest part sometimes.  You look around and you see everyone else, and no one lets on that anything is wrong.  Some people make life look so easy.  I haven't know easy in a long time.  There's a Sheryl Crow song that goes, ""No one said it would be easy, but no one said it'd be this hard.""  I hear that in my head a lot.  I'm not looking for easy, I just wish every minute wasn't such a struggle.    I will say this though.  Today has been an amazing day.  I came on here looking for help, and have found myself being able to help others.  I can't tell you how great that has made me feel today.  This is a feeling that everyone should know.    My husband died a little over a year ago.  I have been working three jobs to try and support our two kids who are 3 and 4.  In January I went back to school to pursue a degree in nursing so that I could have a steady future.  I can not tell you how intimidating it is being back in school all these years later and being a mom on top of that.  It's going well though, and I'm excited for the future.    We are barely making it each month, but we find a way.  My daughter is going to turn 4 in two weeks, and I'm having a small party for her at our home.  It has a modest budget, and I've been coming up with what will hopefully be fun cheap activities for the party.  What I'm hoping is to make it a pizza party.  It's just something that the way the bills fall and the money comes in that I'm not in a position to really splurge on.   I'm praying for some help and appreciate anyone who stopped to even read this.  Thank you. "
2895	False	a	I am super hungry in Arizona. I would love a pizza. 
2896	False	a	Hey all,  Figured I would give this a go.   I'm Broke and currently looking for work, I don't have ANY food in the house (I finished the last of it last night, tomato sauce sandwich woot!) and haven't had anything today bar coffee and water :(  So yeah, hurts me to do this but anyone feel like shouting me a pizza? There would be much love!!!
2897	False	a	Currently studying for my second final and haven't been eating well (mainly just once a day) Most of the time it's maruchan ramen, sometimes those $1 banquet meals if I feel like i deserve it...My Bank of America account has literally 2.67 left! D:  I would be eternally thankful to the stranger that buys me a nice hot pie of pizza! In the future I promise to return the favor!  Also if you need any sort of validation I'm be more than happy to give it to you (to the best of my ability)
2898	False	a	I'm pulling an all nighter tonight studying for my test, could really use some pizza
2899	False	a	My cat ran away and I have to stay in my house so I can get him if he comes back so I can't get up to pizza hut to get food   :(  help please
2900	False	a	My gas got shut off, I owe a grand to the electric company, I haven't paid my student loan bill in full in months and I have been out of work too long now, even though I have been applying to dozens of jobs a day and am signed up with temping agencies, have a bachelors... I can only afford to eat about once a day now as it is and I can't stop thinking about pizza, which would be a dream at this point.   I am doing everything I can to try to make ends meet, I work for family, friends, temp, hang IT technician fliers around town, but since I lost my job every other opportunity has seemed to dry up in Chicago. I have an interview tomorrow for a paying internship and I would love to be able to walk in there on a full stomach.  Being Chicago, there are hundreds of pizza places and I am not a picky guy but if you were going to buy me a pizza please don't pizza troll me with anchovies :P I like meat and veggies and would be so grateful if someone could help me take my mind of all the shit that's going on in my life right now with a hot dinner.  edited a typo.
2901	False	a	Today I ran out of money and would really like a pizza, it's been a long week and it's only Tuesday! Will provide sob story upon demand :)
2902	False	a	I'm currently staying in a motel for a few nights while awaiting a financial aid check, thanks to an assistance program in my local town. I've been eating protein bars, and hot dogs which is what I've been able to afford cooking in a microwave. Anyways, I have class all weekend, studying really  hard and I could sooooo use a pick me up like a pizza! Being homeless has been tough, but I'm working really hard to build a better life for myself, despite a few hiccups...
2903	False	a	Let me start off by saying that I've read some of the posts here a few times and have always wanted to give someone a pizza.   I lost my job over 4 months ago, right before my wedding. We had an idea that it was going to happen so we saved up some money. Our savings and my wife's job have been enough to pay the bills for the last 4 months. But that money has run out.   Last week I was lucky enough to find a part time job but I haven't started it yet. My wife and I have no money right now and have been eating hot dogs and ramen for the last week (seriously, 7 days). We could both really go for not-a-hot-dog for dinner.  Thanks for everything RAOP!  **EDIT** I Should say that I'm in Upstate NY.
2904	False	a	I was referred here by a redditor I am good friends with on IRC. I am currently starting my own business, so I've been living paycheck to paycheck due to new expenses. I don't have any checks coming in until next week. I spent the last of my money to buy a bag of food for my dog so he doesn't go hungry. Any help would make the next couple days much less miserable.
2905	True	a	It's been a rough couple of days. Didn't get my paycheck before labor day like I was supposed to, won't get it until sometime tomorrow if I'm lucky. They also cut my hours in half at an already part time job. Found out that my childhood home in Bastrop burnt down, here's my [Facebook Post](http://imgur.com/OMho5) about it.  I'm hungry, I'm out of cigs, and generally stressed out about everything. Just would like a pizza to help make it til tomorrow.  
2906	False	a	I'm a 20 year old college student who works full time to pay for school, but I don't get paid until tomorrow and am desperately craving some pizza to help study for finals. Living off Ramen Noodles for the past 2 days has been less than kind to my body, and any help would be greatly appreciated. 
2907	False	a	I am grateful for what I do have but eating bologna for 2 months gets to a person. I have copd and have trouble getting around. If anyone is kind enough to help out I would appreciate it. I am a widow and live alone with my pup.
2908	False	a	Hey y'all. Just showed back up to campus last night, and completely forgot that the food court closes early on Friday nights. No real money to speak of until financial aid kicks in, and I could use food that isn't a vending machine bag of chips. Shoot, once I start getting my housing allowance I'll even return the favor.   TL;DR:  I'm an idiotic sophomore sometimes. 
2909	False	a	I'm just hungry I get paid in three days and I'll pay someone a pizza back. Straight up.
2910	False	a	Last Tuesday my friend of 6 years shot himself in the head and killed 3 other random people.  It's been a rough 2 weeks thinking about the whole thing. I haven't ate much and can barely get up in the morning to go to work.  
2911	True	a	Hey there fine folks of RAOP! I'm a sophomore here at Texas State University. This year has been particularly tough on me financially, but I've managed to stay afloat until now. I have a disease called Hidradenitis Suppurativa. I would not suggest google searching, unless you'd like to lose your appetite. I've been living with the disease for six years and it's been incredibly difficult. I get large cysts, sometimes the size of baseballs.. in my underarms, between my breasts and in my groin area. This makes it so hard to move any of my extremities, really. My insurance recently stopped paying for my medications, so I'm having to spend $2,200 a month to keep myself able to function properly. I have tried so hard to keep myself above water, but it's impossible with all of the medical bills from radiation therapy (not covered by insurance) and medication expense. I'd really love to have something, ANYTHING for dinner. Of course, when I'm able, I will pay it forward.  EDIT: I can offer to purchase you something from Amazon in exchange for pizza.. I'm broke cash wise, but I do have a bit of money on my Amazon account.
2912	False	a	My reddit cake day!
2913	False	a	Looking for some pizza tonight, will send out two pizza's to lovely redditors come my paycheck Friday. Had to use my last paycheck to pay off rent, getting sick of potatoes and butter.
2914	False	a	I spend a lot of time between NYC and Washington, DC. Spring break is officially started and my usual arrangements are all in a worst case scenario kinda way, exhausted. My parents are out of the country, my fianc√© is on a ship, phoneless and I am here very hungry. Ask me anything you want to verify! 
2915	False	a	Hey guys. I'm at work and hungry as hell. After work i have to head over to a gig doing video work for them. I'd love to get me a bite to eat but I don't have any money til friday. Be a friend? :D
2916	False	a	He's a 20 y/o Canadian. We live in different cities each attending a different uni so we frequently skype and he's always talking about how hungry he is and how he's just dying for some decent food (and pizza happens to be his favourite food). He's pretty broke and is trying to pay off uni tuition so he's saving every penny for it. I'd buy him some but i've only got just enough for myself. If there's someone out there looking to help a broke student out, let me know!
2917	False	a	I have (college) finals this weekend and I am going to be studying all night tonight and tomorrow. My friends and I could use some pizza!
2918	True	a	I can repay you with lovely services. I could of course write you a silly poem, or perhaps create a poster or book cover for you, I could record myself singing a song - very poorly I might add (So that might not be the best option) I can call you on skype and read chapters upon chapters of Fifty Shades of Grey. (That's everyone's favourite, eh?)
2919	True	a	Just started school at Cuesta College in San Luis Obispo, CA. I didn't realize it would take so long before I started to see any money from my GI bill. A real meal would be nice.
2920	False	a	I've been eating saltine crackers all day :/
2921	False	a	Today, I'm with my 10 year old sister. I spent the day with her yesterday, and I'm going to spend today with her again. I plan on going to the beach with her later. Now, I *do* have money, but sadly, all I have is a $20 from my mom which I think I might need to spend on gas because the tank is almost empty, and my own money, which came from my last paycheck a few weeks ago, and I have been saving. A little help would be appreciated. Now, I would like to give something in return to the sender of the pizza, because I like giving back. So in return, I will draw you whatever you want (mind you, I'm not that talented). Thanks so much!
2922	False	a	Apparently there has been a huge delay on food stamps in the state of NC due to some software changes. And we have been delayed for about a month. We just got hit with it.  Large Family 2 adults 4 teens 3 little ones. We are in the process of contacting local churches and food pantries etc. Let me know. Papa Johns is the only things that delivers to our house (out in the boonies).
2923	False	a	I just moved here from Boulder, CO (originally from St. Louis). I finished an internship in Boulder and my girlfriend is here in grad school, so I guess you could say I followed my heart. Anyway, I'm working on moving into my new place and could really use some pizza to help with the move-in.  Thanks!
2924	False	a	I'm currently sitting at a McDonalds, where I slept in my truck last night, with no gas and no money for food. I didn't get anything to eat yesterday, and so far today it's looking like it's gonna be the same way. There is a Pizza Hut within walking distance, and would really appreciate any kind of food. It really sucks to have to ask for something like this, but it's either this or go outside and beg for money face to face.
2925	False	a	I just paid my rent and have no money left. I am a full time student and I work. I'm fresh out of food and don't get paid until Monday... This would make my night.
2926	False	a	I'm having a really bad day. First off, it was 90 degrees and I was standing at a bus stop trying to get back to campus (I go to the University of Chicago). Suddenly, two guys come up and grab my bag and run off. I spend the next couple of hours with police officers trying to find my bag which has my phone, a dress that I bought for my cousin's wedding, and a ball of yarn. I'm really bummed and would love nothing more than a pizza to end my bad day on a better note. 
2927	True	a	I guess my situation is pretty typical. I'm unemployed and in school and trying to make every cent last as long as possible. That means a diet of mac and cheese, sandwiches, ramen, and cereal. Prepared foods like pizza are luxuries that I haven't been able to afford in a very long time. It's eight bucks for one lunch at a Chinese restaurant, or eight bucks to buy bread and meat for sandwiches that week. So if anyone has a spare pizza lying around I'd be grateful for it.
2928	True	a	I've never done this and I should probably use a throwaway, but whatever. I've been unemployed, again, for a few weeks now and my unemployment checks are less than half of what I was making when I was working. I've applied to over twenty jobs in the past month and only one has even gotten back to me to say that they had found someone better suited. All of my bills and rent are/were late, I can barely afford enough food, and, to top it off, I can't even go snowboarding....which is truly the only thing that keeps me sane in the winter. All of my friends are snowboarders and most of them are out riding tonight. I'm not saying a pizza would cure the shit that's going through my head, but I could definitely use one to help restore some optimism in my life. EDIT: I know I'm not in the worst of shape with where I'm at, but I do battle with some very strong depression from time to time and right now is one of those times. Also, I'd always rather give than receive and bringing myself to ask for help is one of the hardest things for me to do.
2929	False	a	Topperstix with pizza sauce from Toppers. I long for its taste.
2930	False	a	Hi I just moved to Waltham MA from my home state of PA and could use some comfort food on this very lonely day. Thank you!!
2931	False	a	First time trying this out. Here goes nothing.  Did my taxes today, and I owe over 2k for last year.  I already work 2 jobs, 70+ hours a week, with student loan bills near 1k a month. No way I could work much more than I do now. Just had to inform my two great friends/roommates that I need to move out of our house and back to my parents' house to save the money up in time. The move would change my 10 minute commute to near an hour, and push me further from my girlfriend.   Shit, could I use a pizza right now.
2932	True	a	"Been following RAOP for a while for the d'aww of it and upvoting people who need it.  25 y/o here, I've always been independent so this is a little weird for me.  I was laid off from my job of 4 years 3 weeks ago.  After an intense job search, I was hired into an OK paying new job a week later(dancedancedance!) and everything is going fantastic there.  Their pay schedule is harsh (paid in arrears 1 week + 2 week delay = 3 weeks no pay) and I'm not due for a pay check until Friday.  My final paycheck  from my last job went into paying rent/keeping the power on/getting a bus pass etc etc. I'm the frugal type but even with my efficient spending, over the last few weeks I've dropped a lot of weight (down to 5'10"" 125lbs). So just putting this out there since I'm darn hungry. Any kindness will be returned in the form of filling a request when I'm back up and running financially.  Vancouver, Washington is right next to Portland, Oregon. ... Northwest USA.  Thank you all for reading and for being there.  Happy Holidays to everyone!"
2933	True	a	I could really use some help. I took my dog [Volk](http://tinypic.com/r/241rqmf/7), he was 25% Timber Wolf 75% German Sheperd, to the vet yesterday because he stopped eating and was generally acting really weird, not wanting to move. It had been getting worse over the course of last week. After the vet's initial examination, he thought it had something to do with Volks kidneys, so I left him with the vet overnight. I got a call this morning from the Vet's office, telling me that it was some congenital disease, that causes terminal kidney failure and that though I could probably keep him alive on dialysis for a while, it would be extremely expensive and he wouldn't be living a full, happy life. So, I went in this morning and said good-bye.  Anyway, the total cost of the visit, tests, and euthanasia was close to $300, all of which I had to pay up front. That was supposed to be grocery money. I feel bad asking for help from people I don't even know, but all my roommates and friends went home for the summer, and I promise I'll pay it forward.  I'm in Dallas.
2934	False	a	EDIT! fireflygirlie hooked it up! Thanks so so so much!   My boyfriend and I just broke up a few days ago. I'll try to keep it short because it's complicated and dramatic, but I'm heart-broken. I did pretty well the first few days, but it's finally setting in and I'm at a loss. I never saw this happening and I don't know what to do with myself. I'm trying to cheer up by watching reruns of Arrested Development. Since I'm paying 100% of the bills (another dilemma I'm attempting to work out), I'm flat broke. If there's a kind soul out there that could feed me some cheesy love, that'd be great.   I'm using a throwaway because I have some IRL friends that use Reddit and I'm a little embarrassed. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
2935	False	a	Hey RAOPers, today's been a pretty shitty day. I've been suffering from depression all semester long, and it's really affected my school work. I found out from our disabilities services counselor that I won't be able to pass two of my classes this semester. I also had a really shitty therapy session today that mainly resulted in a lot of crying. I hate to post a sob story, but a pizza right now would do a lot to cheer up my night, but I'm also really low on cash. I get paid next Friday, and I promise I'll pay it forward after getting my paycheck. Thanks so much!
2936	True	a	Central Missouri, USA.   The current temp is 105. On the upside I got a potential job offer today! It only took about three months, too! :p !!  I would love some pizza tonight to restore some semblance of normalcy to my life... and after a lot of walking today, the idea of turning on the stove top to make rice again seems depressing.  A haiku to commemorate the day:  Eggs on car hoods fry   Pavement seems a bit sticky   Worth it, job offer.
2937	False	a	My brother called me to ask if I could drive to his house and buy him some food since he's been too sick to go out for a few days. I'm pretty sure all he eats is sushi from the restaurant he works at, so some pizza would do his body good.  In return I offer an awesome TV show: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EkN8WtFTpE (also I have a few copies of dota2)
2938	False	a	My husband doesn't get paid until Friday, and until then we have no money.  I took the week off to study for MCAT, and now I regret taking the time off. If you're in Tucson, I'd be willing to trade some pizza for some...adult herb?
2939	True	a	My fiancee and I have been spending all day organizing my father's house after he passed away a few weeks ago.  It's been a lot harder than I thought it would be.  We only have $2.27 in our bank account until I get paid on Tuesday, and it would be really nice to not have to heat up ANOTHER Cup O' Noodles tonight, and instead be able to relax and chow down on some deliciousness.
2940	True	a	EDIT: Thanks DelicateCrush, I am very thankful. :)
2941	True	a	[I've made a diagram for you-all of what I'd like to happen.](http://i.imgur.com/yKjmh.png)  I have no sad story to woo you all with, simply that I am raiding on Warcraft without pizza--which I'm pretty sure is right after the holocaust on the tragedy scale.
2942	False	a	I've nothing I can sell, not even my own blood because apparently you can't do that if you have a fever. If anyone can help with a pizza, I can only promise to pay it forward when my life is less messy! Thank you so much in advance. I'm not sure how this works so pm me I guess? 
2943	True	a	I love pizza. I don't have enough money in my bank account to order one. I'm really hungry. I don't have a car, so I can't go get pizza in person. PAPA JOHNS IS FAR AWAY, IN BALTIMORE.   BALTIMORE. I love Pizza. Pizza is my favorite food. I am alone tonight and PIZZA WOULD BE SO WARM AND LOVING.  If anyone would be so gracious, I would pass down the warm pizza giving when I have available funds. I can also send pictures of the pizza in my hands, mouth, and while I am doing homework.
2944	True	a	Lost my job Monday. Sucks. I think a delicious pizza would be great... but I can't afford one... If someone could please buy me, even a cheap large cheese would be better than the growling stomach I have now. Thanks. 
2945	True	a	"Also, as a ""victim of the drug war"" I may serve time soon. Thanks and best to you and yours. "
2946	False	a	I live in California and my boyfriend lives in Colorado. He lost his job and is struggling to pay bills. He can only eat when I send him money, please please please send him a pizza! Comment or send me a message if you're interested! Thanks in advance :)
2947	False	a	Well, Hello RAOP!   Not one to normally request things from others but I am desperately craving a pizza :/ All I have at my disposal is a shrimp alfredo lean cuisine (ack?). Bank is actually at a negative balance thanks to the fees that are imposed monthly.. sigh... lol... A pizzahut Pizza would really be appreciated!   Thanks Reddit!  will pm verification to offer-er if they want it!  EDIT: Success! Finally managed to hunt down a hidden stash of cash, thanks **benkeiofthehillpeopl** for the offer!
2948	True	a	I'm re-posting, as my post of three days ago wasn't replied to.  Following a longgg period of underemployment, I found full-time work at this call centre; pay's great, benefits are great, but they're holding my wages a MONTH (as they do all new hires), and I'm utterly broke.  A hot meal would be so, so nice today.  I've asked and received here once before, 1 - 2 months ago. Hoping to be in the spot to pay this forward soon. Thanks a lot, RAoP! 
2949	False	a	Me and my girlfriend of three years just moved into our first apartment together, a little one bedroom in a small college town. We're both students and employed, but the move has proven costly.   We don't have any food in our fridge and my car broke down earlier today while I was moving stuff to our apartment.   Any random act of pizza would not only cure our hunger but would also make my day ten times better.   [Fridge Proof](http://imgur.com/QQ446)  Thanks for reading :)
2950	False	a	Hello everyone I could use something good for lunch today , I am broke until Tuesday and bArely have enough food to feed us until then. I will return the favor Tuesday . ThAnk you all for reading
2951	False	a	Things have been a bit tight around here lately. Our kids (4 and 5 year old boys) have been asking for pizza for weeks and we always have to say no since our food budget is only enough for groceries, no extras. Our oldest got the best color possible in school Friday (purple!) for the first time and we'd love to celebrate with pizza.  We're hoping for just one more lean month before we're out of the hole and are able to pay it forward.  Thanks for reading!
2952	True	a	EDIT: THANK YOU SO MUCH To Piccolittle for sending me a pizza, it is truly appreciated and was a wonderfully kind act.  As the title says.. my birthday was terrible. Saw a grand total of 3 people in my family, only one of which actually remembered it was my birthday.. Asked my mum to do one thing for me, which was to not drink on my birthday.. and she was drinking when I got there at lunchtime.  Another member of my family demanded to know why I was upset that they hadn't remembered it was my birthday. -.-  Unemployed too, so money is super tight.. would absolutely love a pizza right now. Thanks.
2953	True	a	I have a coupon for papa johns which gives 50% off for pizza. That's two large pepperoni for less than 15 bucks. Sadly a bit beyond my financial means at the moment. It would go a long way toward dinner for a few days.  
2954	True	a	There's too much month at the end of my money and I've gotta pull an all nighter to catch up a bit in my classes, can somebody help me out?  Edit: Seems its already the next day, but I'll keep this request up as I have $0.97 until the first and I'm ready to puke up ramen. 
2955	False	a	I'm 22, I live on my own. I ran out of work in the beginning of December. ...been living off of what I can. Unfortunately I ran out of food a couple days ago....I need to eat something. I will buy you a pizza and I'll also find you a cat who has a pony as a best friend as soon as I can!  Thank you!
2956	True	a	I ate the last of my PB&amp;J sandwich fixings yesterday and my mom isn't able to buy me more meal blocks until Wednesday. I'll draw a kick ass picture of you as a superhero if you feed me :)  EDIT: wow, putting my e-mail out there was a major slip.
2957	False	a	Hello, let me give you the story. I was kicked out on sunday and spent two days with a friend. My girlfriend was coming in from canada to stay at a hotel room which was supposed to be booked at $280 dollars. When she got here, the hotel came out to 460$. The extra money came out from our food fund, and we had about $20 for food and it ran out. We have been eating the little bit of snacks we have and its starting to make us sick. If you could spare a pizza please do. &lt;3
2958	True	a	Me and my girlfriend and her little nieces just got back from walking to jack in a box hoping to get 2 orders of tacos for the 3 bucks in pennies and nickels we had, but there was a problem, the cashier was a total jerk and did not want to take our change because she didn't want to count the bit we had there. So now i feel bad for her ( and my future) nieces ;) and we are on the hunt for random pizza ! 
2959	False	a	Alright, that first part isn't entirely true. I did spend last night in the ER, but not for anything terrible. But I'm broke and really hungry and would greatly appreciate the help of a fellow redditor.   In the Southwest Washington area.
2960	False	a	im an aspiring music producer/college student... a broke, hungry one :/ check out my work here. i will remix the song of your choice in exchange for a pizza. http://soundcloud.com/mindcntrl
2961	False	a	This has been the worst week of my life.  Monday, my grandmother died.  Tuesday, I spend all day getting affairs in order to go out of town for a few days. Important to note that, on this day, I lose my driver's license.   Wednesday morning, I'm having trouble finding my passport, and I end up making my ride to the airport late for work.   Thursday goes off without a hitch!! Luckily!   Friday, there's a lot of last minute things to do for the funeral this morning. My mom asks me to take her car to go pick up the dress Nana will wear for the funeral. I decide to grab some food while I'm out. When the girl is handing me my food, I drop the bag. Awesome. Love Friday.   Today, immediately after the funeral. I get dropped off at the airport (5 hours away) and go to check in, only to realize I've missed my flight by 4 hours. I just checked into a hotel near the airport.      I'm just asking for something small. My credit card is under so much stress right now, and I really can't afford to put more money on it without breaking my ability to make a payment this month.    Also, my nephew used my cell phone this morning, and logged me out. I have no idea what my account's password is until I can look on the computer tomorrow morning. I'd be happy to provide some other verification though.
2962	True	a	I received a pizza from this sub-reddit about 8 months ago. Just wondering if anyone is willing to help again?
2963	False	a	Hi, ROAP. I'm in a bit of a bind until Friday - I thought the money I was pulling from my savings/mutual fund for living expenses would be here by today but I just called USAA and they said it won't be available until Friday. I'm good on rent, utilities, and gas until then but I have two apples to my name and only have $38 (soon to be $13 after I go to the doctor's tomorrow). Living on a pizza and probably some more fruit that I pick up tomorrow won't be super healthy, but it'll get me to Friday =)  Verification code available, other pics available on request. Thank you vm in advance.  [Monies proof](http://imgur.com/OvbsY)
2964	True	a	Guys, even though I work two jobs and go to school full time money is always tight and sometimes I run out. This week is one of those times. I havent had anything to eat today except for a couple of snacks I could scrounge from a friend's house. Any way someone could help a fellow out?
2965	False	a	I could really use a pizza right now.  It's my friend and I, and we have nothing to eat / no money.. and his car is in the shop.  So if one of you fine gentlemen , or fine ladies, could give us delicious, hot, circular-shaped heaven.. We would be most grateful.
2966	False	a	Just moved to Iowa and have been looking for a job since the beginning of the month.  Had a really good job interview today and was wanting to celebrate with the wife.
2967	False	a	Hey guys, so my little sister is upset as her friend tired to commit suicide and is in a coma.. i want to get her a pizza but i'm poor as hell, anyone able to do that?  we live in the UK, surrey area!  thank you..
2968	False	a	Here is my story. I have a 3 year old kid, and due to some bad budgeting this month. I am out of food for the next few days. My son is or course more important than me, and so I've been scraping together what I have to feed him, but I haven't eaten more than a few chocolate covered nuts at work since sunday.   Thought I would give this a try, hoping for the best. 
2969	False	a	Have today off, soo I'll be stuck in the house all day cleaning and doing homework that I've put off for a week... Just looking for a pizza pie for lunch! :)   EDIT: Welp, got hungry and finished my homework, so I ordered Jimmy Johns instead, maybe next time! :) 
2970	False	a	Umm, pizza god? Hi, its me, chemo. My little brother and I have no money for food, and our fridge is completely empty save for some frozen corn. Were trying to save that for the weekend. I will try to do any stunt you can think of for pizza. Jump off my roof? I'll do it. Ask a stranger for a ride around the block? I'll do it. Smoke peppercorns? You bet your sweet bippy. I will post a video of the stunt, and post it here. We live in north Texas, in the dfw area. Thanks for listening!
2971	False	a	Hey guys, I'm in a tough situation and my mom has no money. She gets paid every second Wed. of the month and I've had Ramen Noodles and Mac N Cheese for the past week for Lunch and Dinner. It would be amazing if someone can help me out. I would be willing to barter with pics of my cat doing goofy stuff. 
2972	True	a	He is pretty miserable, we dont even have a TV or anything up there. Was hoping someone might be able to help me treat him tonight as I cant afford to myself. Dont get me wrong, I have noodles so we wont go hungry just daydreaming of something tastey :)
2973	False	a	Willing to respond with creative photography of pizza.
2974	False	a	"Hey redditors! My 4 year old son had to have an anterior tibialis transfer to help correct his clubfoot.  The surgery went very well, and Shriner's ended up releasing him about three hours post surgery.  He's now regained his appetite and is requesting pizza. We'll make sure to post a ""thank you"" picture if we're gifted."
2975	False	a	I'm going to the grocery store tomorrow, but as of now I have 4 slices of bread and some frostbitten ice cream. I also have not finished packing. I'm a terrible procrastinator. 
2976	False	a	Ive spent most of the weekend in bed with strep throat. I cant afford the doctor so I'm eating expired antibiotics a friend found in their medicine cabinet. Anything would help.... 
2977	False	a	"I made the genius decision to avoid my drunk ex-boyfriend who usually is so wasted by 7pm on Fridays that he starts harassing me at the bar with ""I know I just dumped you but maybe it was the worst decision I've ever made"" by staying in tonight. I've also made the genius decision not to drink which would inevitably cause me to pathetically text him until he pays attention to me. I'm craving extra cheese pizza like whoa. If someone feels generous, help a bitter lady stay in and watch Star Trek. It would restore my faith in the fact that a lonely reddit life is absolutely better than the real world. EDIT...SO many likes...no pizza. :("
2978	False	a	hungry couple in greater portland oregon area. no SSD $ til friday. nearest place is pizza hut. we will pay it forward when we're able. God bless!

2980	False	a	I haven't eaten all day (except for muh cereal, but it was the nock of publix brand chereioes. Oh I also ate publix icecream, but someone left it was a milkshake. Not to mention the fact that I dropped the container spilling i....)  wow I just realized how many food related accidents I've had today. Anyways I dropped the container and spilt melted icecream all over the kitchen floor. But at that point I didn't care because my bagel was done. It burned in the toaster. Hurt but not knocked down I scraped the black off the bagel and put some delicious salmon cream cheese on it (if you don't have salmon cream cheese get some it sounds extremely gross, but is actually pretty decent). Finally my little brother (14) tried to snatch my bagel out of my hands. He knocked it into the air luckily I bobbled it enough to regain control of my delicious snack. Unfortunately, I also bobbled cream cheese all over my arms and face. but fear not! I took revenge by sneaking up on him from behind and slapping a large amount of cream cheese on his face (the good kind).  yeah. That was my day today (not to mention all the college apps I did). This is why I deserve a mushroom pizza. Cheers.
2981	True	a	i think we all know why we are here, and mabey this is the first step to admitting how depressed i am, but ive run out of food and could use a bite to eat to make it through the week &lt;3. Im in Manchester NH. Not goin anywhere so feel free AMA heh.
2982	False	a	I have posted my story before (ironically in a thread kind of about pizza) here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/jkqak/dominos_pizza_deliveryman_saves_dude_from_psycho/c2d11rd?context=3  I don't begin to receive food aid until next month and I'm trying to make it until then.  If any kind soul would like to send me a pizza, I could really use one.  I will provide verification upon request.
2983	False	a	Hungry as heck, I'm just looking for a good pepperoni pizza delivery, by Dominos or Pizza Hut, or whatever delivers home. First post, tell me if I'm doing something wrong. Thanks, and Happy Holidays!  EDIT: Would need the pizza TONIGHT, no later. Thanks again!
2984	True	a	Woke up with a massive headache and sore throat, so ended up missing work. Tried to play some games to relax, but had constant losses(why do I play competitive games to relax? lol). Pretty much out of food and don't get paid until tomorrow, so food would be appreciated. :D  Now, don't take me as desperate. Worst case scenario I'm hungry for one night and have plenty of food tomorrow. Still, I'd appreciate a pizza!  Edit: Near Boston, Massachusetts.  
2985	False	a	Hi, RAOP. First timer here.  Nothing terribly special... UK dweller (South East Coast represent) who lost my job last August, ekeing out a living for the last 6 months or so on my severance pay but nothing has come up yet.  I've held out for as long as I can without making a claim for any benefits (which I've just started on) and have been living super frugal for the last month or so. 39p pasta sauce and a can of tuna only gets you so far before you want to throw in the towel. Come Monday I can stock up on some more varied food stuffs again (and pick up those Skyrim PS3 DLCs that have been rubbing my nose in my shitty financials) but right now, I'm hankering for some comfort food.  If someone can help me out, I'll be paying this forward at a later, more  financially stable, time.  Peace out, fellow Dovah. Your love is appreciated.
2986	False	a	"To start things off, my birthday was March 7th. Last year i spent my birthday with my exgirlfriend. She brought me to a beach, then to a bar in seaside for food. We fought all day. This year i spent my whole birthday working in a sheet metal factory from 7-6pm. One friend smoked me up, then the rest of the night i spent smoking up all of my other ""friends."" My best friend didn't hit me up till 3am the next morning.  Now that i'm done being a little girl, heres what really sucks. i got laid off at the factory two days later because my boss's twin daughters were hospitalized for something. Last week my car exploded on the parkway while on my way to secure a new job at a dispatch company working on ambulances. Water pump exploded, lighting my alternator on fire.  AND NOW. My droid 2 was stolen from me at a party last saturday. NOT TO MENTION THE BRAND NEW ITOUCH I GOT FOR MY BIRTHDAY FELL OUT OF MY HANDS WHILE FUMBLING WITH MY KEYS THE NIGHT I GOT IT.  TL;DR broken itouch, got laid off, car broke, phone stolen, lost career opportunity could really use a pizza."
2987	True	a	I posted last night, but perhaps it was a bit too late in the evening? I have zero funds, no food to speak of, and I've been hungry for days now. I was in a car accident a week ago and life has been pretty crummy as of late. I know this is a long shot, but anyone feel like helping out?  EDIT: Thanks pandyfackerlling!
2988	True	a	My fellow redditors, this week has probably taken the cake (or pizza? please say pizza) for worst week of my life. Two weeks ago my SO and I went to visit our respective parents in our hometown. SO had just gotten his Masters and we were there to celebrate. SO grandmother has a heart attack the day after we arrive and is in the hospital the whole time we're there. She died 3 separate times and was revived. All planned celebrations are (rightfully) ceased. Return home a week and some later after grandma is stable to find that our power bill is in arrears thanks to a shitty roommate we had and they are threatening to shut off our power. They refuse to work out any kind of payment plan and more or less tell us 'all or nothing' by 6pm tomorrow or we're out of luck. Next, find out the oven mysteriously broke while we were away and can no longer cook anything decent. Found this out after I attempted to cook a frozen pizza and was horrified by the half cooked doughy mess slithering through the oven rack. Don't know where I'm getting the money for the power bill and probably going to have to pick up stakes and move back home... but please reddit, if I can use anything right now it's a random act of pizza.   **TLDR: SO and I returned from visiting sick family member to discover our power is going to be turned off tomorrow; oven died and mangled a frozen pizza we were going to have for supper.**
2989	False	a	I won't pretend I would go hungry without this delicious doughy cheesy love, but I do have a story.  I just emptied the little money I had left in my bank account to register for classes at my local community college.  I never finished my degree and left and worked at a big company making good money for a while.  When that came to an end I moved and had no clue what to do.  I have been looking for work for over 2 years now.  I just recently had to move back home, and I am incredibly lucky to have a mother who would even allow such a thing.  She still has two pre-teen children at home, and works incredibly hard.  Hopefully I can be a positive influence to everyone now that I am living with my fam.  I know my little bro is going to love the three drumsets I brought home (he just started learning).  He seems genuinely interested in music, and I know that's one thing I can really help him with.  Even though I didn't work over the past few years, I have had some great experiences that really started to give me direction.  I am lucky enough to be able to live at home now, and go back to school.  My goal is to get back into a University in a years time, study in intnat'l business and economics and live in Europe for a while (I love to be the foreigner and there is so much to see!).  I kinda did everything backwards, but I am actually excited about working towards my goals.  I would love to celebrate this new beginning with some pizza, but the few bucks I have to spend for myself are going towards bills and I want to take my little bro to go see the Hobbit tomorrow when he gets off of school.  Like I said, I wouldn't go hungry, but pizza seems like a good way to celebrate the first step in changing my path.  We all must face the consequences of our actions, and I want my actions to finally start having beneficial consequences.  A part of me is scared that I will just fail the whole college thing again, but I know I more mature now, and can accomplish what I want out of life.  Fear is not an excuse to not try.  Thanks for reading!  I know my story isn't unique, but it is mine nonetheless.  edit:  I guess it would be useful to know I live right near Google HQ in San Fran Bay Area.
2990	False	a	As the title says, my GF is leaving me. We've been together for years. I'm pretty torn up. I quit my job and left all my friends behind to move to this city with her after she got a job offer here, and it's been a nightmare since I got here.  I came down here and interviewed, was drug tested, and filled out paperwork for a job before I ever moved here. However once I got here they told me they couldn't hire me because of a hiring freeze. I've been unemployed for 2 months and it is terrible - I've not had a gap in employment for 5 years. My girlfriend thinks I am a loser despite my taking care of our 3 cats and dog, doing all the household chores, and applying for many jobs and going to interviews. I supported her when she was unemployed in the past, but she does not care.  In addition my car is going to be fixed Friday, which I desperately need so I can continue looking for work after my girlfriend leaves me. I owe the mechanic $800 and I have to drive 4 hours to pick it up.  I can't let this stuff get me down, I need to keep my head up and find a job here so I'll be able to support myself.  With gas and everything I am completely broke. This is my first time on this sub - if someone would be so kind as to gift me a pizza it would totally brighten up my life. I will pass it forward when I become employed. Thanks so much!
2991	False	a	This is not for me, but for a family with five kids that live about 4 blocks away from me.  A fire destroyed their home Monday evening, and they lost everything.  I can't imagine how devastating that must be, but I'd love for them to be overwhelmed with compassion. Here is the link to the news article, including who to contact in order to contribute.  (I also posted this in [r/foodpantry](http://www.reddit.com/r/Food_Pantry/comments/iw27z/request_family_of_7_lost_their_home_and_all_their/) )  [Local News Article](http://www.lebanon-express.com/news/local/article_d75a08aa-b24a-11e0-b0cf-001cc4c03286.html)  &gt; *From the Article:* &gt;  &gt; **How to donate to the victims** &gt;  &gt; Anyone with clothes or other donations may contact Tia Parker at (541) 990-8003.  Edit: formatting
2992	False	a	As the title says, simply a bit more broke than normal this month. I get paid on the 28th and I have enough pasta + pesto to last (and cereal for breakfast) but I'm just sick of it having basically eaten that for over a week now.  Would really like a pizza or something just to change things up. 
2993	False	a	**EDIT: NEVER MIND! Since we couldn't hang out, my girlfriend made me and delivered dinner! Here's my sob story anyway**  I never really did this before so I'm not sure how it works, and from the looks of how many people are posting and asking for pizza, I probably wont get any, but it's worth a go. My grandfather has been in the hospital for a week and my mom just went in this morning because she has pneumonia. My dad, who is still in the middle of work, just drove my sister to her soccer game and is going to visit my grandpa, then to visit my mom in a different hospital, then going back to work. He came home for a half hour and he said I can't leave the house because I have SATs tomorrow morning and no one can come over because no one is home. When he left he told me we have nothing to eat and to buy my own food tonight and he'll pay me back. I just checked my wallet and I remembered I just spend my only $20 to buy a prepaid card to buy a game on Steam last night and I'm kind of regretting that now. Now I'm stuck here alone for two hours until my sister gets a ride home from her soccer game and who knows when my dad will be home. No matter what time he gets home, I still wont be able to eat. So all I'm asking for is a small pizza for one so I can eat tonight.  TL;DR: Grandpa and my mom are in the hospital. My dad drove my sister to her soccer game then has to visit two different hospitals before going back to work. Home alone. Can't buy pizza because I bought a game last night with the last of my money.
2994	False	a	I'm a life long Arkansan who dearly misses my [Damgoode Pies](http://www.damgoodepies.com/) who was going to Damgood since it was Pie-Squared (or something like that).      I recently moved here for an IT job and I am currently a full time employee but I'm requesting if someone is driving here anytime soon to grab me a large handtossed Spinato. I dont care if it sits in the sun for 2 days, I'll nuke the shit out of it. I'll pay for it and even give you some gas money for your troubles. 
2995	False	a	Sup brahs and brahettes, I'm just a regular canadian man looking for some pizza. If you get me some, maybe I'll be your friend :) So yeah no sob stories from me, cause who really wants to read about that and be depressed all day? 
2996	True	a	 I'm kind of struggling today so If anyone could help me out that would be the best!
2997	False	a	I have no pity story. I'm not poor (well...I make enough to survive), and I'm not starving. I'd just really like to celebrate. I think I did pretty damn well in the interview, nerves aside. If I get the job, I'll be able to actually make some pizza dreams come true.    I solemnly vow to randomly pay the random act of pizza forward. I'll probably buy somebody a pizza in the future anyway...but I'll make it my duty if a kind stranger were to hook me up. Hell, might even throw in some wings or breadsticks.
2998	False	a	Hey everyone! I really want Pizza and I know there are people on here that do too. If there's anyone on here that resides from Toronto, Ontario maybe we can cut a deal? It would make my time easier as well as yours ya dig?  
2999	True	a	After the past month, maybe its time to finally check this place out.  The great news is I've been at my job now for 3 weeks and pay day is Friday - I'm getting a room!   Bad news is, I haven't been eating very well at all - for the most part, I've provided for myself, but this week has been lean. Anyone want to help me celebrate my soon to be obtained freedom from this private hell with some delicious delectable discs of cheese, tomato sauce &amp; toppings?   I'm not expecting anything, won't mind if it goes either way, but I know that I'll be paying it forward this weekend. Also, since I don't have an address -  I wonder if this is even possible  Best wishes RAOP, you're probably the coolest community.   edit **I would ask that this ticket be considered closed - Tarable, the sweetest person ever has made my night** pics coming soon. 
3000	False	a	Eglin AFB, Fl.  My husband and I live on a military base. We don't get paid until in the am of tomorrow and we are down to no food and 47 cents in our checking. We are so broke because of me. I have illnesses that require medication that our insurance doesn't cover, as they only cover generic. This man has given everything to me and wants to take care of me. I wish I could do the same for him. So please, we need our faith in strangers restored. We will do the same. Please. 
3001	True	a	Here's my pitch:  I'm a sophomore at Yale University, and I've got a long week ahead of me - I've got a fundraiser to run in New York City, I'm going to be without my laptop for a week while it is being serviced, and classes are actually making us do work now.  I could go on and on about my firstworldproblems, but I think you get the picture.   What I'm asking for tonight is what I think will be a fair exchange.    1) YOU ... provide the food. New Haven is arguably the pizza capitol of the world (I can hear the hisses already), and so there's plenty of pizza places out there we can set this up for, however... There is also a really awesome website called OneButtonWenzel.com that allows you to a press a single button and order the ultimate buffalo chicken sandwich.  It's cheap, its easy, it supports a business - a great deal for you.  2) I... Will do my best to give you a fair shake. I'm not going to make some sort of pitch that you're helping a dying college student over here - we do have a meal plan and everything, so I want to give you something of substance.  I will photograph the consumption of your order, while confirming as many Ivy League/Yale stereotypes as possible.   AS A BONUS If you order two (2) WENZELS, my whole SUITE will get in on the action! That's right, you'll have a pictures of a room full of WASPY New England folks enjoying the delicious late night meal you have provided.  Offers like this don't come around every day - now is the time for food.  I hope you'll join me in this venture.   EDIT: Zombica has been kind enough to provide us with food, and so we'll do our part to provide the pictures while we are waiting for it to arrive. Delivery here is totally random, so it could be until 2:00am before they deliver - if that's the case, it is a risk we are willing to take.  EDIT 2: The Wenzels arrived, and they were awesome. Check out the pics below, and give Zombica as much karma as possible - she is the best, and totally made our week.
3002	False	a	edit: You guys rock. Thanks to Jesst for pizza and InfiniteInsight for kind words and company. 
3003	False	a	my family is away on vacation. I have three dollars to my name and no license.  basically broke, hungry staying in on a saturday.  If anyone one would like to buy me pizza I would be sure to pass it on sometime later this week.
3004	False	a	We be working the university Help Desk the day after thanks giving, we might be the only people here. please feed us.
3005	False	a	Alternatively, will write limerick for pizza.  I appreciate it.
3006	False	a	My son is having some friends over because he just got out of the hospital! He had to have surgery on his arm after a fall and now he is doing better, although depressed because he has to wear a cast for the rest of the summer. He is having a party to celebrate, but me and my husband don't have much money because we had to spend a lot for the surgery. (thank you obama). If someone could please send us an egift card that could feed 7 kids and 4 adults we would be very appreciative. Thank you all for what you do on this site and god bless. I know my son will be so happy for this.
3007	True	a	I'm 36 weeks pregnant, and currently broke until payday tomorrow.  I've been living off of ramen noodles and cereal the past few days, but my supplies are dwindling.  Here's proof - http://i.imgur.com/PRbVY.jpg Thanks reddit! 
3008	False	a	This week has been the worst week of my life. I'm currently failing a class so I have a shitload of work, I feel constantly depressed, I don't even want to get out of bed and I only have 30 cents in my back account and I have strep throat :( this week isn't for me, I would love some pizza
3009	True	a	I'm currently in my second year of a Computer Science degree at the University of Maryland.  I've been living on loans and a part-time job for the summer, but due to a paperwork screw-up I'm currently between loans.  On top of THAT I had to sink 500 bucks into my beater car to replace the brake pads.  I'm down to about 100 dollars on my credit limit and 30 bucks in my debit account - just crossing my fingers each day that I hear back from the financial aid office.  I'm so sick of ramen day in and day out, and I spend minutes at a time fantisizing about a fresh, hot pizza.  It would make me feel so much better.
3010	True	a	I've got some staples in the house, Ramen, PB &amp; J, and a beanie weenie casserole and I will be going to the food pantry on Monday (I get paid on Thrusday) But I would totally dig a pizza tonight. (Maybe a soda as well?)   There is only so much ramen you can eat before you start to lose your mind. I know everyone post I'll pay it forward when I get paid, but I WILL pay it forward on Thrusday. :)
3011	False	a	I just found out im pregnant and I was wondering if anyone would be willing to buy me a pizza for me and my future son (or daughter :P) in celebration. The dad is gone and wont be coming back (just a bastard, hes not dead) so I need the money I have to plan for my new family.  Thank you!
3012	False	a	Hello, I am 24 years old, I am a full time worker, a full time college student, and i live all on my own, not easy to do but i manage. Its the end of finals I am broke, at home with pink eye, so i can't work today (not my choice) and i'm broke. I would really like some pizza. If any of you can help me i would be extremley grateful. Thank you.
3013	True	a	Hello! Normally we would never do this, but we (me and my girlfriend) were hoping someone might be nice enough to buy us a pizza tonight?   Normally we wouldn't be in such hard shape, but delays in receiving my paycheck and some crazy insane overdraft fees (THANKS TCF!) have left us with a grand total of $2.50 between the two of us until Sunday.  We promise to pay it forward to another needing person next week when we are finally in the black again. I can send you proof of that if you would like. I used a throw-away for this post, but I would have no problem verifying my identity to anyone gracious enough to help.   So, if you might be interested in helping us out let me know. We will be browsing /r/aww in the mean time, keeping a smile on our face and positive attitude on this whole situation. Thanks!
3014	False	a	I would love to chill out with a pizza tonight, I will give you a shoutout on a youtube video. (Yes I am watched by many) and I will give you a great big shoutout and thank you on video. I dont get paid till tuesday and I am sick of eating corndogs.... hahaha.. Pizza sure sounds good. 
3015	False	a	When I have the means I *will* pay it forward.
3016	True	a	I'll save you all from a pity party, but right now I'm really unable to do most normal things thanks to medical issues.  I can even tell you about them if you PM me.  I don't need a pizza, but I do want one.  I have food in the house and I'm not going hungry, but pizza sounds great and because of medical issues I haven't been able to work recently (going back soon though!) and sometimes pizza is the greatest comfort of all.  I live in the midwest, if you PM I'll give you the exact location but as of right now it's not even noon so this is more of an asking in advance.  And like I said, this is a want and not a need so if someone here is way more needy then me, feel free to skip me.  Whatever happens to me, I will happily pay it forward when I can.    Thank you.
3017	False	a	Hello everyone (anyone?), how are you guys?  I've never posted on here but I could really use some help.  I have basically no money right now thanks to rent being awful, but I will tomorrow thanks to pay day!  Honestly, I would have no problem just being kind of hungry today but I have to study for a midterm all day/night and my hunger is becoming very distracting :\    Blah, I hate posting an annoyingly self pitying story like that but that's my situation and I could really use some help.  I was really hesitant to post this, because as a lurker I have no karma.  I only really upvote/downvote so if you want confirmation that I'm a hardcore reddit addict I can send you a screenshot of the liked tab on my profile!    Well, that's that!  So thanks for helping, thanks for reading, thanks for being cool :P  edit: and oh god to explain my username, its an inside joke as that was my first AOL screenname!
3018	False	a	I've been laid off for almost two months now and have begun skipping/ stretching meals. I would really appreciate a pizza, thanks so much. Much Love.
3019	True	a	Hello RAoP!  My fianc√© and I have been living on cereal, grilled cheese sandwiches and jello for almost 2 week now. Our [fridge](http://imgur.com/pXp9j) is bare aside from the essentials (milk, cheese, bread) and will remain that way until the 3rd. I'm okay with eating this way for a couple more days but my guy is going crazy. He just went off to work with a sack lunch of the usual and made a comment about how his stomach is shrinking and it made me feel bad. I was thinking about a hot meal I can make (for us for when he got home) with what we have but there's not much. Plus, I have a fussy baby on my hands. We have an 8 month old who is a high risk infant so she gets a monthly RSV shot to prevent her from getting the nasty virus. She's been a handful since yesterday :(  I've never requested a pizza here before and we aren't really the types to splurge on eating takeout. But if I had the money I'd do it today, as it would raise our spirits. I just got my verification code so if anyone can hook it up I would greatly appreciate it! I would also pay it forward as soon as I'd be able to :)  Thanks &lt;3  
3020	False	a	I just woke up from a pretty good night at the bar and pizza sounds delicious. I'm a singer/songwriter as a hobby and I'll trade you one acoustic song about the topic of your choice (I'll improv it), recorded as an MP3, for a pizza.  I'm in the Portland, OR area.
3021	True	a	I have been away from my husband for what seems like years even though its been like 4 months. We live in different countries so getting all the paperwork in order had taken a toll on our wallets. Luckily my sister and grandmother let me move into their apartment that they just got here in Dallas, Texas. My sister was working in a emergency pet hospital that shut down two month ago. She's at a new job now, but for the last month we have been struggling with finances to keep all three of us a float and especially keeping our pets fed before us! Us three would just be super grateful to have something besides dry pancakes this week, until the first of us sees a paycheck.
3022	False	a	Hey everybody, I just found out about this subreddit and I am requesting a pizza pie. Simply put, my dad has been in the hospital for a long time and is awaiting a procedure for this upcoming week. My mom is always at work and the hospital with him and whenever I'm home I have to find something to cook. Any kind of help would be amazing. Thanks.
3023	False	a	Experiencing times of hunger :/
3024	False	a	Evening, Reddit! I've had a rough day, and a pizza would make it so much better! I'm getting paid on Friday, so I'll be sure to give the gift of pizza when I can, but right now I'm hungry and sick of soup. Please help me if you can! Thank you!
3025	True	a	I would really appreciate a meal without having to walk to the grocery store in my state. I'm rather financially short but I would love to pay it forward with my next paycheque. 
3026	False	a	Hey all,  I recently tore the ligament in my left shoulder (two nights ago) and I am now stuck in my apartment. I am (like so many others) a broke college student who now has to pay for these medical expenses, and I find myself somewhat down in the dumps as I cannot hang out with my friends or do anything productive as I am hopped up on vicodin all day and night.   I could really use a small pick me up, maybe in the form of a pizza? :)   I plan to return the favor to the other needy posters here in this subreddit as soon as my shoulder heals :)
3027	False	a	Hey guys, my summer campus job just ended and I'm going to be broke until my new one starts in a week. Pretty hungry and I won't be able to buy food on campus until the semester starts on the 31st. Save me from ramen! Haha
3028	False	a	Things are very tight for me, and have been for a long time. But that's going to change soon :) as I'll be moving into a fantastic house in the heart of the city, with two lovely friends. My expenses will be halved, and I'll be closer to everything that's hapening :D   I keep feeling this mix of anticipatory excitement and nauseating terror - it's clear that this is kind of a moment, like I'm closing a chapter on one part of my life and starting the next one. And I wanna celebrate with pizza, not with ramen or easy mac, which is all I'll have til payday on Friday.  So really, I just want a greasy carb bomb to the gut, to properly honor this moment! Thanks :)
3029	False	a	Struggling financially...I work as a line cook and our hours get hacked in the summer time.  I get paid on Monday and have cereal to get me through, so I'm not gonna starve :) but if anyone would like to help, that would be amazing.  And I'd love to pay it forward when I get paid.  I don't like the thought requesting if you aren't also willing to help someone else.  
3030	True	a	"&lt;div class=""sob-story""&gt;  So I've been unemployed for awhile now but doing what I need to to make things work and not trying to make it anyone else's problem, got some things going to try to help get me some kind of income going in the meantime. Went to meet someone to sell an item and ended up turning back because they messaged that their car broke down. No big deal, stuff happens. Went to HEB to get some milk and bread, basic staple stuff. Card declined. Try again. Declined again. Insert sinking feeling here. Try once more as credit. No dice. So I left empty handed. Get home and check the bank account to see what has happened, because I had at least $20 to my name. Nope. I'm now negative almost $200 due to a payment I wasn't aware was hitting today. Fantastic.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Now, I have food, it's just not anything special (ramen, pasta, rice). That said, I would much rather people more needy than I get pizza'd. But if someone felt like helping a guy not feel like he's at the bottom of a dry well, I'd be quite thankful.  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class=""TL;DR""&gt;  Tried to buy basic foodstuffs, bank account surprise-buttsex, feels bad man.  &lt;/div&gt;"
3031	False	a	At work tonight in a hotel and none of us have enough cash to order a pizza or anything for that matter. We would really appreciate some free food to fill out empty hospitality worker tummies.
3032	False	a	Hey, the title pretty much sums up the story. We're a little low on funds and a pizza for this forced bachelor would be very appreciated. 
3033	False	a	Hey Reddit, We're 3 brothers currently freelancing in web design/development and as for now don't have a penny to our name, in fact, quite the opposite of negative pennies. We'll be willing to do web development, illustration or graphic work of your choosing for pizza or we can come up with something for you. FYI we're located in the UK Cheers  EDIT: the offer is still open as mr-smor was unable to order online for us due to geographical location and no stores accepting paypal.  Thanks again mr-smor.
3034	False	a	I have no noble cause to rally any givers to. I am not in absolute need, but I am completely broke and in debt, with a somewhat empty fridge. I am not starving, I have bread and canned goods. I mostly just want some pizza, because pizza is awesome and I'm hungry. Getting over a sunburn so bad I couldn't walk (swelling), if that helps.   All in all, there are better people to get pizza for. But I still want some.
3035	True	a	I have been dreaming of pizza all day. Unfortunately my sister needed some cash today, which I lent to her, forgetting don't have work tonight and can't go in to earn tips to get through the day. I am not clever or particularly talented and cannot offer anything original in exchange for pizza.  What I CAN offer is a beautiful pair of shoes, your choice! I'm a member of justfab.com, it's an online shopping site, and I have a bunch of reward points wracked up. If you'd like, you can visit their website, pick out a pair that catches your eye, and I'll have it shipped to you! In exchange for pizza!  Sweet deal!
3036	True	a	I've ended up sticking myself in a bit of a rut, guys. I've been living on my own for about 6 months now, and about 3 months ago, finally found a job. It's great and all, but the hours are less than desirable. Corporate won't let us go over 32 hours a week. I get paid every two weeks. This last pay period has hit me pretty hard in the wallet department. I finally had the money saved up to put down on a vehicle. A motorcycle, actually. Considering how cheap they are overall, I think it was a pretty good choice. Unfortunately, paying my bills, $100 out of the paycheck for the motorcycle payment, and another $100 or so to get it road legal...Has left me without food until Friday. The change that I've collected over the past couple months adds up to $6.17, which I need to use to fill my gas tank so I can get to work.  I'll be straight up here, a large pizza could feed me for 2 days, 3 if I stretch it. I would certainly be willing to pay it forward to another unfortunate soul in the coming weeks, if someone were to help me out now.
3037	False	a	Tomorrow is my best friend's birthday and lately she's been going through a financial rut. She and her mother live alone in a small house which they've been paying out the ass for. There have been many instances where I'll intentionally over bake something so I can give the extra to her and her mother. Unfortunately, I don't have the funds to buy her a pizza myself since I splurged on another gift I thought she might like.
3038	False	a	Title says it all if you could help I would love you forever!!
3039	True	a	The title pretty much sums it up. I am stuck at work for a 15 hour shift and wasn't able to eat breakfast. I can't afford to get anything for myself due to recent bills. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I have a Domino's near me; I think that's everything I needed, thanks for reading.
3040	False	a	Just lookin for a kind soul to help me out.I jus moved back to florida an I've spent all my money getting a place for me and my daughter and my disabled mother for whom I care for and all my money was spent on moving here we literally have nothin in the cabinets or fridge it would b nice to order them a pizza n soda so at least I know they have food in their belly I don't start work until next week so I hope someone helps..thanks
3041	False	a	I'm working part time now, my hours were recently cut, and I can't even afford to pay my current bills. I am about to get a new job in insurance sales, which will cure my financial woes (and will be able to pay it forward). However, I have a class and an exam to take and then I have to apply for a license, and it's still gonna be several weeks. In the meantime, I'm super hungry. And pizza just sounds so damn good. I'm in Virginia, if that matters.
3042	False	a	lost my graphic design job. absolute fucking dream job, gone. idk how long it'll take me to find a new position, but i hope sooner than later. dude i'd be so ecstatic if someone can hook me up with a pie. long time lurker - first time poster. i read the sidebar, i have verification and i am located in PA. please and thank you
3043	True	a	I would absolutely love some delicious pizza. That warm baked crust; the gooey cheese; the sauce that compliments both crust and cheese alike. Maybe some succulent ham or some savory pepperoni? Mouthwatering. Would anyone care to hook a brother up?
3044	True	a	new in town and waiting for that first pay check (15th) living off change/2$ p. terrys burgers til then.. we spent our last 20$ today on diapers and goat milk.. if you can help with a pizza we will return the favor to another Redditor or I will make you a delicious dessert of your choice next week... (if you're in Austin)  thanks for reading love and light, juanwonton
3045	False	a	Making dinner and the chicken that was supposed to be fresh smells like a newly birthed Orc. Mom had to work a double and my stepdad, douchenozzle that he is, took off without his phone. If someone could buy a pizza for us that'd be great.
3046	False	a	I am hungry
3047	True	a	Left work because I got sick (threw up, fever, exhausted) anyways I am really craving some Pizza Hut and have no money and could repay or pass forward in two weeks. Enjoy this whale http://i.imgur.com/yzpIN.jpg
3048	True	a	Starting a personalized songwriting business. It's going to turn into a community for songwriters and listeners to interact and coordinate the creation of a personalized song. Ideally, it's going to forever close the gap between the songwriter and listener, and give struggling, talented songwriters an opportunity to bring happiness to anyone in need of a song, for anything; but I've got a lot of work to do before then.  I probably won't have enough for rent this month, but my landlord's anniversary is coming up and I'm writing a song for his wife, in exchange for letting me be a week late. This leaves the unfortunate angle of food. I'm all out of bread.  Instead of just asking for a pizza, let's make this a symbiotic relationship. I will write a song about whatever you want. (Literally.) It will be catchy, awesome, and recorded in the form of a high quality mp3, in exchange for a delicious ham and pineapple pizza. I'll even submit it to you before you send a pizza, if you're wary about the deal.  If you're interested in hearing about my business, I'm funding Step 1 through kickstarter.com. [Here's the link to that](http://kck.st/pgKaih) Back me, or send it to a friend you think might be interested in a personalized song.   Otherwise, pizza for a song. Savvy?  If you want to hear some samples of what I do, check www.soundcloud.com/thallett (not sure why it's not linking...) out.  Thanks!  EDIT: **Thank you Czhunc for the pizza! It was fantastic. The offer is still open to anyone that wants it. I can always use a pizza. ** 
3049	False	a	He has the car with my wallet inside of it, so I'm stranded here with no money or transportation. I think a pizza might help calm my rage. 
3050	False	a	Recently I have started back at university for year 2 and my funding application hasn't been processed yet. I have been volunteering with my local charity and although the work is good and I'm getting experience and references and all that, I'm not earning any money. My application probably won't be processed for another two weeks and until it is i'll have no money, and most importantly, no pizza.
3051	False	a	Hey guys, I just fasted for 5 days for the Hunger Unity for East Africa fundraiser here http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=224652260904169 if you wanted to check it out.  All i had for the last 5 days is 3 V8's and a Herbal Tea (so i didn't die and kept my strength up)  Now that it's over, i'd love a fresh pizza. If someone would be so kind as to email me a card for pizza (pizza hut, dominoes or something) I'd be ever so grateful! Thanks again! Reddit on!  EDIT: Thanks to HOTMAMMA, I live in the USA, just so you guys know! EDIT: Thanks to SarTim, I pulled my email address, if anyone is kind enough to get me one, post here and i'll PM you my email :)
3052	False	a	I'm a little broke, but not super broke.  I have stuff to cook.  So, I'm not really begging for pizza as there are other people who probably need it more.  I was just wondering if anyone has come across any good coupon codes recently... I know I've seen them posted here before, so I figured I'd ask.
3053	False	a	Well, me and my girlfriend are celebrating our two years and I don't have any money whatsoever to pay for anything for her. I work at burger king but my paycheck goes straight to my savings account, for my little baby girl on the way. I would really appreciate if someone could send me a pizza, I know I'm new on here, but I found this site from wishuponahero. I recieved some clothes from there, but haven't asked for something of this sort. I just need this help just once.
3054	False	a	I'm 37weeks pregnant and would love nothing more than a Stuffed Crust Super Supreme Pizza mmmm (mouth watering) Just something I am craving but we don't have the money to splurge on right now ;-) Please b my Pizza Angel :)
3055	False	a	 Stumbled across this subreddit and figured it was worth a shot. My cousin and I moved out on our own a few weeks ago and he is unemployed. I have been paying all bills/ buying all groceries and other expenses. We've been living very meager and haven't eaten out since we moved. We were talking the other day about how we would love a pizza. I anyone would kindly donate we would be very appreciative and would most certainly reciprocate in any way we can.
3056	True	a	She is getting rather old and I moved in with her to help around the house, lift heavy things, drive her to bingo, etc...   long story short. Im poor, yadda yadda who cares..... Her cooking isnt what it used to be....    I WANT A PIZZA...  Thanks yall... 
3057	False	a	hey, this is my birthday tonight, i'm looking for a friend, someone who can bring some happiness in my heart. what better way than a pizza ?  will food be my only friend tonight ?
3058	False	a	I'm a broke student. Seeing all the pizza commercials on TV is driving me crazy. Can someone help me out? Any pizza will be promptly paid forward.
3059	False	a	My boyfriend introduced me to reddit a while back. I'm from Finland and I have only 0,27 cents in my bank but I'd like to surprise him with a pizza since he's been having a rough week, and also has no money to get anything to eat. I wonder if anyone here would be able to help, I'd appreciate it a lot.
3060	True	a	Southeast Michigander here. We're a couple living together in a small home on have been on a single income for nearly four months now. My S/O just got a new job but there wont be a paycheck for a couple of weeks. I've been floating us by but we're both college students too so it's not like we had any sort of saving to speak of :p.   Anyway, we were hoping for a ROAP with an absolute promise to pay it forward times two this upcoming Friday. We've nothing but soup and green beans in the pantry! (Although green beans are damned delish aren't they? Just not very filling. :D)  Thanks for hearing me out &lt;3 
3061	True	a	Check clears in my bank account on Monday. Someone, please help one hungry dude get some calories for today?
3062	False	a	They are asking for pizza and I am hoping someone can help them get one tonight. thanks for viewing. Oh Im in MI
3063	False	a	Just got a job and will have enough money to make rent! Huge relief, but the cupboards are empty. Anyone wanna hook me up with a congrats pizza? Abbotsford, BC would be sharing it with my S.O
3064	False	a	I am in desperate need of food until I can finish training at my new job, which doesn't even start until the 14th. I have only $4 to my name, which I need for gas for when I start my job, as well as to find a white button up shirt at Goodwill.   If anyone could help with a pie that could hold me over a few days, I'd be elated. 
3065	False	a	I have been sick since Tuesday and my fiance has been taking care of our son Tony(6) and baby girl (3 months). He has been taking care of their every need and making sure I got rest so I could get better. Our son was a big help also. When dad was making bottles, Tony would keep baby entertained. He helped dad whenever asked. I really appreciate my fiance and all he did this week to make sure everything was taken care of. I am feeling better, just have a sore throat and a slight headache. I haven't been able to cook for them and I know they would really love a pizza!   
3066	True	a	"TL;DR - My spouse and I are hurting too bad to walk for groceries and have run out of food.   I am mid 30's, hub is in his 40's.   We rely on one another to get things as a team, but the last two days, my knee has been ""out"" and his back has been ""out"" and our grocery trip relies on us walking a half mile to the local Walmart neighborhood grocery store, filling up backpacks and a large rolling suitcase, and walking home with them.    We have to do our month's shopping all at once because we are on the stamps and to break it up into smaller trips wouldn't allow the money to stretch.   We have an offer for a ride to the store tomorrow, but we've been eating once a day for a week and ran out of food yesterday.  Please pm me if you can help. Willing to answer any questions.  [Edit] Spelling"
3067	False	a	Hey all, my coworker and I are stuck in an empty office for the next four hours with nothing but hard candy and empty stomachs. We're getting close to payday but until then we're both broke as joke. Anyone want to help a couple of hungry Georgia Peaches?
3068	False	a	hey guys, me and some friends, there is three of us total are all flat broke(all our money goes to rent and basic needs, we just all moved out and in together) but were totally out of food without access to even a grocery store to even try and rack some food, and due to a recent cold snap its been way to cold to panhandle. If anyone could order us a pizza we would be forever in debt.
3069	True	a	I can offer you my sob story, but I don't think that would be too appreciated, haha... So in short, my mom and I are both students, and completely broke. I work but get very few hours (overnights, and hours have been getting cut like crazy recently), and my mom is currently unemployed and has been trying really hard to find a steady job (her school schedule doesn't make it as easy as it had been before she went back). More than willing to repay when I get my taxes in! Thanks :)
3070	False	a	Hey everyone,  I'm a student here at PSU and I'm going through a bit of a rough patch here financially. I haven't eaten anything but ramen and spaghettiOs for a while and I'd love to actually have a nice hot pizza. Please let me know if you could help me out tonight. I'd appreciate it greatly, thanks!
3071	False	a	Hey reddit,  My husband and I have been kicked off of food stamps for a few days because of paperwork not going through. We're getting that fixed, but money is super tight, and my parents showed up today to help finish the tiling in my grandma's bathroom. The house (especally upstairs) has little to no air condition, and it's really hot. I was hoping to offer a pizza for them for dinner when the work is done?  They really should get to eat, and we don't have the money, or food in the house, to feed them. So if anyone wants to buy us a pizza or 2 to share, that would be fantastic.   If you want proof of my parent's work, I can provide that.   Thanks in advance.  Edit: Ok, grandma messed up and mom and dad left. Hubby and I wouldn't mind a pizza if someone wants to give one though. Just thought it'd be fair to update.
3072	False	a	I stayed out way too late on a Monday because a friend got arrested and would rather deal with a few days at home than the shitstorm he'd deal with by telling them. Spending my time right and marathoning the wire anything would help.
3073	True	a	I am a recently seperated mother of two wonderful kids. My husband walked out on us for someone else and left us high and dry. I have been a homemaker for 10 years. I'm actively looking for work and awaiting foodstamp benefits. It would be fantastic if a gracious redditor could randomly pick us for dinner tonight. My account is brand new but I guess everyone has to start somewhere.
3074	True	a	Me and my brother have been sick, and my mother took the week off of work to take care of us, and my father has been working more to compensate.   Everyone's pretty grumpy, so I figured a pizza would be nice!  EDIT: THANKS TO BRIGUY9876 FOR THE PIZZA!
3075	False	a	We are doing projects/writing papers/preparing for tests and ramen just isn't cutting it anymore. Could really use some pizza! :) 
3076	False	a	I just recently moved to a new town (first time on my own). I have tried very hard to get a job doing anything. I am a very hard worker but, no one seems to care about that anymore. I will probably have to move back home because my parents won't help me with anything. Im 19 and going to school for film and photography. I have heard Reddit was a very friendly community. I have posted stuff before but am still kinda new to this. Any help will be greatly appreciated and I will somehow try to pay it forward. Thank you all.  EDIT:Round Rock, TX
3077	False	a	Hello! I'm new too reddit ( over a month thankfully) and found this wonderful subreddit! Last month, me and my boyfriend were living out of my car. We ended up living and sleeping there for a month. I had a job, but my hours were minimal and we could not afford rent. It was awful, just recently though we both got jobs and we are able to offers the tiniest little place. Unfortunetly, bill this month left us short on cash with empty cupboards. A cheese pizza, would make the world a little brighter for us!   If you have any questions about our homelessness, feel free to ask!
3078	False	a	I live at home with my mom and sister and my mom just got out of the hospital with diabetes related gang green on her leg and we have no food in the house and no money until the first of next month.  We live near Warsaw IN and it would be very helpful if we could get a pizza.
3079	True	a	We are currently stressing out in our newsroom for various reasons to get content ready for the next day's paper. A pizza would make this all go down much easier and give our News editor moments of precious peace.
3080	True	a	I am a student and I work at my school's IT call center. Pay day was supposed to be today - but everyone's time sheet was not submitted due to a clerical error. I only have .88 cents in my checking account and was really counting on getting paid today so I could go buy groceries. I have some staples in my pantry, but those really need to last for two weeks until next payday. I would really appreciate a pizza to make up for not getting paid today.
3081	True	a	Hey Redditors, I'll try and keep it short. I've been broke for quite some time with just enough money to pay for rent. I recently got a job, working I.T., but I wont see a check until the end of the month. My sob story isn't all that bad, i'm glad to finally have a job! I just don't have any money yet for any food.  I was just wondering if /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza would be willing to help me through this Saturday night.  Edit: Thanks Numb3rs4 for the kind words. Also, here's some proof. I hate looking in my fridge. http://imgur.com/2Hkchis
3082	False	a	He turned 6 last saturday and wanted pizza for his birthday but we don't have the money to get him any. I had an interview earlier today also, and the guy made it sound like I had the job. So it'd be nice to celebrate these things with some pizza!  We have a domino's here.
3083	False	a	I'm already a bit strapped for cash this summer.  But I manage to have a good time.  Unfortunately, on my way to my friend's house last night in the Champaign region, I got robbed at gunpoint near my house.  While he didn't get really any money from me, he got my phone, ID, and cards, and without those, I can't use the little money I have, especially since all of those will have to be replaced... for money.  :/  My friend suggested this to me, and I was wondering if any of you could help me out.  Thanks for listening ^_^.
3084	False	a	Hey all.  Didn't get to eat much for dinner last night and I am not getting paid until tomorrow. Could really use a pie for lunch, I'll even share it with coworkers. *Pay it forward* right?  I'm not sure exactly how this system works, first timer. I did the verification code thing but it says not to post in thread.  There's a couple pizza places really close to my work where I can go pick it up on my lunch break (anywhere from noon to 1pm). I'm eastern time zone.   * Neighhood Pizza Company: 905.984.5555 * Boston Pizza: 905.688.0273   Thanks for looking!
3085	False	a	Hey all. I am sick at home and the only thing I'm craving is pizza. No transportation and broke on top of that. Will anyone help out? Thanks!   ETA: Will provide verification code
3086	False	a	i'm a 22 year old part time college student (anthropology). alcoholic dad kicked me out last night. parents got divorced and can't stand my stepdad. this is so pathetic but my bank account is at zero and i have no cash. living off mcdonalds dollar menu for lunch.  quick edit: Hunger really makes you realize how much the world has to offer, and how little you have. got my verification code thing too.
3087	False	a	I just ran 7+ miles and would love a pizza, I have 0 dollars and am pretty hungry! (Everything I have takes hours to cook). Any size is fine! PM me for my address. Thank you in advance!
3088	False	a	My mother is a nurse, and has been working the night shift at work for the past few days, and hasn't gotten paid yet. Child support hasn't come in either. All us kids have been eating the past couple of days are crackers and dry cereal, and lightly with them. Not trying to sound like a sob story, but some pizza would really lighten our spirits. Thanks! Edit: Already getting helped out, thanks PhysicsGirl!
3089	True	a	I am a firm believer in what goes around comes around. Fallen on hard times could use some food in my belly :) Gave a pizza out a couple weeks ago. God bless all.
3090	False	a	I've heard a lot about this subreddit from /r/trees and /r/assistance, but I have been relatively lucky up until now. I'm reaching out to this community! We're going to be a bit short for the next few days until I get paid again, and our pantry is bare and sorrowful.   If you want verification, just let me know! I'll be happy to provide pictures or an email verification.
3091	True	a	We just moved to MD in January and still trying to get caught up in bills, and I'm just trying to break up the cycle of rice and pasta that we've been on for the last week and a half.  I'm okay with still eating the same stuff until we get paid, but I want him to be happy and I don't have the money right now to treat him to a bacon pizza from Domino's. :\
3092	False	a	My 3 boys wear me out every night! I could use a pizza tonight for after when they go to bed!
3093	False	a	I am a new college student and have been having a real hard time these first few weeks with financial aid and as a result i am not on a meal plan this year.  Because of this i have to buy all of my own food which is a problem because i have very little money to begin with.  Ive been having 1 ramen cup a day and thats all i have eaten in 4-5 days.  Im really hungry and a friend recommended this subreddit.  Please Help.
3094	True	a	Currently living on my own &amp; taking summer classes, haven't found a job yet in this town, and ran out of food :(  A pizza with leftovers to last for the weekend would be AMAZING :) please and thank you, folks! :)  also i have .5 bitcoin for you in exchange if youre interested!!
3095	False	a	Hey everybody,  My band and I are from Chicago, and we are in week two of our 5 week tour. The 6 of us have nowhere to stay tonight in southern Oregon so we pooled our money to get a hotel room. Since we have no show today we don't have a venue to provide us food, so a hot meal would be much appreciated. In return, we have merch to offer you or we could send you the digital download of our debut album.   We would be more than grateful for any help, our moms are worried we aren't getting enough to eat. Seriously. 
3096	False	a	Hi.  So, I'm broke, sadly, I don't have enough to order a pizza.  I'm also hungry.  I won't die if I don't eat, but it sure would be nice.  So far today I've eaten the last bowl of cereal and a bag of Ritz crackers.    Thanks!
3097	True	a	I'm an art student and I do Web Development to support myself. I've been waiting to get paid for a week, and am close to running out of food completely. Can't buy anymore till I get the check in the mail. Chances are it won't be here till Monday at the earliest.  A pizza would really raise my spirits. I live in the Chicago area.
3098	False	a	My funds are getting really low. I fucking love pizza, but I ate my last frozen one two days ago. Then yesterday I finished off my shitty instant rice. 
3099	False	a	We are currently looking for work and later today, we could really use a pizza. We understand that it would need to be paid forward at a later date and we're cool with that. We've considered foraging in the forest or going to a food bank, but a random act of pizza would get us through the next two days or so. 
3100	False	a	It's pretty much just like the title says. My cousin and I will write stories for pizzas. We prefer fiction(non-fiction makes us think too much :P), but we will try anything. I might also convince her to draw a picture to go with the story.
3101	False	a	Speaking of do, we have poopwater in our tub. I have been cleaning out the tub for 3 hours.  Yup.
3102	False	a	So, yes. We both work retail to make ends meet, and normally this works out for us, but given that it's early in the year and retail money sucks, we were budgeted to just barely scrape by. Now, with this development, I had to use my last $20 for her Metro fare so she can get to work. That was gonna go towards PB sammiches. Whoops.  This all seems like a sob story more worthy of the pantry or assistance, but it's no life or death situation. Reddit-flavored pizza would brighten the week for us till we get paid on Friday, but we'll still be around otherwise.
3103	False	a	Here's a list of current edible food (edible, keyword people):  1. 4 Eggo waffles (syrup is Dated July 2009, we're good like that). 2. 1/4 box generic Cinnamon Toast Crunch - no milk. 3. 1/3 bag Stale Cheetos. 4. Hot cocoa powder (no marshmallows included, what are we, animals?) 5. 1 slice of American cheese, no bread or crackers. 6. 1/10 Bear of Honey (went well with the waffles last 2 days tbqh). 7. 10-15 otter pops (pi√±a colada flavor, useless).  If anyone would be willing to help out a couple of dudes in need, I'd definitely pay it forward as soon as I can (most likely a couple weeks). Keep in mind, that is a literal stock check of edible food. There is no hidden Ramen or sandwich materials, and the last of our funds went towards keeping the cats fed.  Location: Gilbert, Arizona
3104	False	a	Two tests on Monday and my friends flaked on my birthday dinner and I'm broke as a joke. A pizza would make me feel a whole lot better (and fuller!)
3105	False	a	It has been dark,dank and cold for the past few days and its been bumming me out. Could really use a pizza to help me warm up a little if anybody is feeling generous. Sorry for the repost it's my first time posting on this subreddit and was asked to include a general area.
3106	True	a	A pizza would literally keep me fed for 2 or so days, and would be a literal godsend.  I have no system to really make sure I can eat tomorrow, and emergency foodstamps take up to 7 days in my state.  Anything anyone can do would be greatly appreciated :)
3107	True	a	"I'll send a photo of my driver's license with a ""hey &lt;username&gt;"" next to it. Just thought a pizza could help with a forever aloneness! Thanks so much to the person who can help me, or just to give me someone to talk to as I take one step closer to death o.0 I live in Virginia - edit  Edit: Thanks for the birthday wishes you guys! Even if i dont get a pizza I really appreciate the support. "
3108	True	a	I live in Galveston, Texas and go to Texas A&amp;M University. Last week my tuition was due and so my school took my money from my checking account, which left me with an overdrawn account and maxed out credit card, which is linked to my checking account.   I really am in a bind. I signed up for a short term loan and don't get paid until Friday. I do have some food left, but it's all canned stuff that I am trying to save for the next two weeks. I still have the electricity and phone bills to pay next week so I don't know when I will be able to buy food again. Here's my original comment and PIC in another [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/il3kf/offer_i_have_some_extra_cash_and_id_like_to_buy/c24nm4c)  /edit zelmerszoetrop was able to help! Thank You! [As seen here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/in6nx/received_thank_you_zelmerszoetrop/)
3109	False	a	Hi all. I heard about this site on the radio, and I thought it was the nicest idea. I have been on both sides of this. Able to give, and in need. We were doing ok until my boyfriend lost his job this past March. Which is fabulous since around the same time we found out we were pregnant with our third child. So he has been pounding the pavement trying to find a new job, and in the meantime my salary gets stretched pretty thin. We use to have pizza night on Friday with the kids. We'd get a movie from the Redbox, enjoy a pizza pie and have a fun family night. Its amazing how you miss simple things like that. I hope we are soon in a position again where we can give more, and need for less. Heck, I hope we all are. Times are just hard, jobs are scarce and I just hope things get better for everyone. But if you are in the position to provide pizza night for a grateful family, it would mean a lot. Maybe show the kids that yes, money is tight...but not everything is changing. Things are going to be okay. And I will surely pay it forward. Thanks for reading :)
3110	False	a	"So. Was randomly 'asked to resign' or 'get terminated' from my job that I loved as an EMT. I think I'm about to get another job, but, it's been hard because I help provide for my elderly adoptive mother (she's 82). We're getting low on food, and today she just walked by me and said "" I wish we had a pizza"". I feel terrible because I can't afford such a luxury right now and she doesn't eat enough as it is, but it made me think of you guys over here! I'll provide whatever proof I can if you want it; Thanks guys &lt;3 "
3111	False	a	I got a job at Dominos recently but they are having trouble getting me through the system and it is taking forever to actually start my training. So if I get a pizza tonight instead of eating PBJ I will pay it forward very soon.
3112	False	a	if someone could get us some pizza money that would be the greatest act of kindness in the history of humanity.
3113	False	a	One of my good friends has recently been kicked out of his dad's house. He's 19, and has no where to go. I guess he's been staying in the parking lot of the store by my house, and he finally just mustered up the courage to ask for a warm bed for a few nights. My mom and I have such a bed, but we have very little funds. We've been living off free bagels and bananas for a while now. I can keep going off of that but I know my friend could really use something more special. I don't think he's actually eaten for a couple days. Anyways, I'm in Boise Idaho, and he'll be staying the night tonight. He's already really appreciative of the bed, but doesn't know I'm trying to do this. I'm working right now, but when I get my paycheck I'll be sure to pay it forward. If anyone can help out, it would mean the world to me, and him. Thanks for being an awesome subreddit.
3114	True	a	So, my best bud had  his phone stolen over the weekend in a break-in. Right after he lost his phone he learned that his paycheck was messed up with our university. I want to help him with a pizza but I can't afford it myself considering I am a student as well. Anyone want to help him?
3115	False	a	I have a boatload of tests this week and am hoping to use this weekend to finish my final projects and study a bit. I've hit a bit of a financial hiccup (http://imgur.com/Lw5wjsH), and am down to my last few dollars and a small bag of rice until sometime next week.   Any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated! Pizza lasts a few meals for me, and there is a cheap 5 dollar pizza place fairly close if any kind soul might be able to give me a hand. :) 
3116	False	a	Hello, Not quite sure how this work, but a buddy told me about this. I am super broke as I've had to make rent and deposit for a new apartment as well as rent for the old place! I will be visiting my local food pantry on Mon, but I'm hungry now. :/
3117	False	a	If any of you have interned on the hill or in DC you understand how expensive everything is here...  you'll understand my plea. I've been limiting myself to one meal under $10 a day for the past month and just stumbled on this sub. I'm a long time reddit user and hate asking for help, but shit am I hungry.  My stomach is screaming at me just thinking about pizza right now. 
3118	False	a	"I hate banks, because of a glitch in the banks system my check n't be in til monday,""cross my fingers."" the problem is that I have a wife and 3 kids who were counting on that check as well as myself. now, we are not only going to be late for rent, our electricity may get shut off as well as we are past due, we only have some ramen noodles and popcycles for dinner.we were counting on my check to get groceries, and as you can see, that is out of the picture. it doesn't help neither of us have fa,ily members here, so we can't even borrow. so if anyone out there can help, we would appriate it.

3120	False	a	I've been having a couple of harsh months (lung surgery, recovering, severe nerve damage, no money, on disability, etc.). Because of the amount of pain I am dealing with I don't get around to much. Overall, my dream is to become a pulmonary/critical care specialist to help people like me. I wasn't going to go back to school this semester because of the pain (and not having any money) but I decided this week to still keep pursuing my education. So I got a loan for school and was approved, and classes start next Wednesday. I am very excited.   Edit: Also because I want to eat pizza on my living room floor while watching all of netflix. 
3121	True	a	Ran out of food this week, can't buy anything for another two days. I'll happily draw a humanoid character portrait for anyone who can get something headed my way!  Examples of my art, and the style and quality I'm willing to draw: http://imgur.com/A6CQbrp http://imgur.com/KDKJCj0  (crossposted to [the other RAoP](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPizza/comments/1gn9st/request_drawings_for_pizza_in_nsw_australia/) because I don't know how to Reddit v well :( )
3122	True	a	Hey guys :) Just found this website...what a miracle. Basically, me and my sister are students and are trying our hardest not to ask our parents for money all summer like we usually do. We have no money until Sunday where we are doing a paid photo-shoot but right now, we are SO hungry.  If we got pizza it would save us as we get so irritable when we're hungry (we all know the feeling)  Please help us!!! We will definitely repay the favour on Sunday! (pizza all round yayay!)  Lola &amp; Heidi
3123	False	a	I'm pretty much flat broke right now, would love if someone could give me pizza I get paid this Friday so I promise to pay back the favor!
3124	False	a	my children are coming home after being gone 21 days and i would like to take them for pizza when they get here but i can not afford it.  we are a family that  lives paycheck to paycheck and are often short on funds, with school starting next week we are truly in the hole.  I want to be able to sit down with my girls and talk about their trip without having to worry about anything.  Thank you.
3125	False	a	Extremely hungry 23 year old in between jobs and out of stuff to pawn here (except my computer but lets be real, I'm not gonna pawn it lol), hoping to find a kind soul that would like to put pizza in my belly. PM me for my address I live in downtown Charleston, SC. You can choose between any of the big chains as well as a few stores. I'd prefer Papa Johns but its up to you
3126	False	a	No g/f (surprise?), no kids, no otherwise horrible story, just a fluke from my superiors.  My payroll dept slipped and my direct deposit didn't go through. I've already spent all my money and was desperately depending on this check. I'm a little f'd here for another few days.  I'll gladly commit a RAoP in the next few days when the suits upstairs fix this error.
3127	False	a	Hey I would so grateful for a pizza right now. I am out of food at the moment, not even ramen left, and my pay check isn't coming till Wednesday due to labor day weekend. I have some tests I am studying for right now, I am in Rochester NY. 
3128	False	a	Just three Southern Illinois University Carbondale students who are hungry! :) I took my girlfriend to the casino and then Olive Garden yesterday for her 21st and turns out I need to brush up on my Basic Strategy. Have a buddy over who is feeling blue and wish to feed him, but dont want to take the hit to the bank account.  A couple of pizzas and a 2-liter should accomplish that!   Thanks for reading!  **EDIT**: Ended up grabbing something else to eat tonight, but thanks for the upvotes! You stay classy, RAOP. 
3129	False	a	"Pizza is soft enough I can eat it without it hurting too much.  So I went to the dentist, she said  ""we're only going to work on one side so you can still chew on the other.""  I said ""Great, what side?"" She said ""The top.""  ‡≤†_‡≤†"
3130	False	a	Hey there, I live in Toronto in a house of starving artists. All I've eaten today is oatmeal and I'd love a couple slices of actual food. I wouldn't have words for how much I would appreciate this. Thank youu Maybe I can trade for art ? I dunno

I ate my last pack of Ramen last night before work. Anything would be greatly appreciated and I'd owe you immensely.  Reddit, care to help a 22 year old down on his luck? (more like out of luck, or at least good luck) Thank you for  reading even if you can't send anything. It's the thought that counts.   **REQUEST HAS BEEN ANSWERED BY THE GUY BELOW. FUCKIN SAINT RIGHT THERE!**
3132	False	a	Hi everyone,  I've been scrounging around for money for awhile now that I'm taking an extra summer course load (something that will ultimately save me money in the long run). My friend, a fellow redditor, suggested that if I was ever hungry and needed help, there were people in a magic place that would get you a pizza. Well, I'm finishing up with a really long week of backstage work and if I could have a pizza when I got home later tonight, it would make me such a happy boy.  I didn't believe it, but here I am. I'm an avid fan of Star Trek, Archer, and theater to give you a little info about myself.   Anyone willing to help will receive a long distance air-five and lots of appreciation from my empty belly. :D
3133	False	a	***EDITED***  Edit: My friend offered to buy me pizza. Hopefully another time, RAoP'ers!  ~~I'm a student at the University of Northern Iowa and I'm working on a web application that I think will be massively useful and hopefully nicely profitable for me Some Day(tm). But until it makes me money, I'm basically broke.~~  Looking forward to the day I can give back a random act of pizza,  Aaron

3135	False	a	Hey guys I've been completely  for months as my wife had to stop working due to ill health (thankfully she is on the mend and returns to work in the new year). I would really appreciate if someone could pizza me so I can remember that sweet taste again.

Thanks everyone have a pic of my dog for your time http://www.flickr.com/photos/benjaminbexson/7591908676/
3136	False	a	Long story short, due to rampant summertime flu circulating throughout the house, our paychecks were short last week, resulting in a momentary budget crisis. Electricity comes before food. We'll be fine on Friday, but we'd absolutely LOVE a pizza tonight. We'll definitely pay it forward. 
3137	False	a	I'm just looking to get a pizza. I will pay it forward on Thursday when my check comes in. 
3138	False	a	"I'm in emotional need.  But today I lost my best friend.   My friend since fourth grade was bullied out of school in 6th, and nobody talked to him. I felt bad for him, and I stuck with him. Several years go by, and I'm still his only friend, so I convince him to come to my school, and meet my friends! So school starts, and he meets my friends, he doesn't really click with them, and decides to meet new people. A month go by, and he meets some really bad kids. Stupid kids no one else likes. Any way, I try and talk to him today, and he gives me a cold shoulder.   When I tell him what he did wasn't cool (being an awkward homeschooler he doesn't know much about being with people), he apologizes. The bell rings, we go to class. After class him and his buddy come up to me, punch me, and run off.   This puts me in a bad mood. I storm home. He texts ""What's wrong?"" I tell him ""You, punching me."" He then, goes on about how I'm over reacting, because I'm upset, he punched me, and I tell him to go away, not wanting to talk, and he just refuses to believe he did anything wrong.  He then argues, that ""I should just suck it up, it's your fault you're in pain, if you weren't so weak, it wouldn't have hurt!""  I then at that very moment, lose it, sh*t hits the fan. I tell him ""Screw off. We're not friends. I don't wanna be associated with a person who believe they're not ever at fault."" I haven't talk to him since. This was a few hours ago. So I'm just lost. He's one of the few people I had left.   I'd just like a Pizza to cheer me up. "
3139	False	a	Hey folks, I was just wondering if there was anyone out there who would be generous enough to hook me up with a pizza! It'd make a nice break from ramen while I wait for the next check and can buy my own pizzas!
3140	False	a	I'm a big fan of The Walking Dead and today was the last episode before the season finale. I hope I get the TV fixed  before Doctor Who! If someone would send a pizza, I'd be very greatfull. Also, payday is next week, so I can pay for someones pizza then.
3141	False	a	My father just recently was a wealthy man with a high paying job at a bank, but because he took a loan from a client he got fired. My step-mom is jobless, filing for bankruptcy, and I work at McDonalds to have my own money. Unfortunately, I've been screwed over twice in the same day yesterday... My paycheck only clocked me for 8 hours where I deserved to be clocked 16, and the bank would absolutely not allow me to deposit or cash my check. So that leaves me without GTA V(which I had planned to buy yesterday), as well as without money in general. I had planned to buy a large pizza to share with my friends while we played GTA V but now none of that is possible. My friend brought his hard copy over to my house, and so now I request a random act of pizza be given to us. Note: This isn't a sob story, this is just a request so please don't feel guilty if you don't want to give us pizza. I have cereal.   TL;DR Wasn't able to get GTA V or pizza, so I'm asking for a random act of pizza. Much appreciated.
3142	False	a	Sitting here trying to do work and I am starrrrrrving.  I have ¬£1.47 in my bank until tomorrow and no food in the house (except cheerios)  I will pay it forward and repay the pizza back to Reddit sometime in the near future.   Thank you kind Redditors.
3143	False	a	I'm new to Reddit, but I love all the different things that go on here. I am requesting just a small or whatever is cheapest pepperoni, and I will send you one back in return tomorrow. I'm not exactly sure how this all works, I've read the sidebar but let me know what else I need to do.  And also, if this does go how I'm thinking, I will certainly become a regular contributor. 
3144	False	a	Hello I just read this article:  http://abcnews.go.com/US/random-acts-pizza-donate/story?id=13950694  And it is amazing that something like this actually exists over the internet, I am here for assistance , because sad to say I am hungry and have been for the past 2 days and my check for the week has already been spent on paying the rent and fixing my car brakes.  If anyone with a kind heart can help me, I promise to return next week and give pizzas to those in need thank you
3145	True	a	Just moved to Austin Tx this year and not having the greatest time. My work cut hours, its hot and doesn't feel like Christmas, my boyfriend and I keep fighting and its bumming me out. A pizza that I could give the pizza bones to my dog would make both of us very happy. 
3146	False	a	After being laid off from a seven year stint, i have been burning threw my savings to pay the bills and keep my belly full. Unemployment barely covers my mortgage and the SNAP program here in florida only gives me $16 a month for food. A Cheese pizza would go a long way today.
3147	True	a	Blasting music and hungry :(
3148	False	a	My step dad just got laid off. We're spending the day together, and he's really down. We've had a tough year, to say the least. He's always been there for me. He married my mother knowing she had a daughter and has treated me as his own ever since. I was diagnosed with MS earlier this year and I wouldn't have been able to cope without him. We're hungry and broke, and I would love to make him smile with a pizza. He's a great person. I'm trying to restore his faith in humanity, essentially. Hope this works :)

3150	False	a	Hey there!

3153	False	a	I'm sitting here, working on an internet radio station I'm starting. I was searching for free pizza coupons. RetailMeNot didn't help. I was about to give up hope when I remembered that there exists a Random Acts of Pizza subreddit. If you would like to donate a pizza, I would eat that pizza with gratitude... and, if you're located in San Diego, CA, I'm looking for DJs.
3154	True	a	Been really hard times for the entire family. Let me surprise my girl and 2 boys with pizza! They haven't had anything but ramen and rice in weeks. 
3155	False	a	This isn't for me but a friend and his family. He's a disabled war vet that worked with me until his injuries made it impossible to function. His wife works as a barista and they have a preschooler. They're flat broke while the VA gets their thumbs out and gets him some medical help, and they need food. I'm going to bring them some groceries but tonight they're going hungry. Any help is appreciated.  Edit: We're in middle TN, if it helps.
3156	True	a	After spending 18 hours in a lot of pain and devoid of any appetite, the pain has either taken a break or I am stone free. Either way I am exhausted and (finally!) starving. Not really wanting to move around much for fear of jinxing the peace my ureter has found and pizza sounds delicious. Anyone want to help a girl out? Your act would never be forgotten by me and always appreciated.
3157	False	a	I've been working on this cartoon idea for awhile, it obviously needs refining but I decided to make my request in the form of a (not rage) [comic](http://imgur.com/hnqAk). Hope you like it! And, ya know, hope the whole pizza thing too..

3161	False	a	My school bizarrely sets meal times to end at 7 pm every night, and as a twenty year old I often stay up about 7 hours after that. As a twenty year old I also get extremely hungry and have no money with which to get a pizza. If anyone would be so kind as to offer me this, I would definitely pay it forward in the future. Definitely not a tearjerker, but 100% factual

3163	False	a	I'm an american archaeology student working abroad in the UK. I don't get paid for a couple more days and I'd like to avoid eating boiled potatoes on their own. Sweet pizza has not passed my lips in over half a year. Can you imagine?  I'm willing to do what I can in return (proofread an anthro related paper? photograph me cutting and consuming pizza with my trowel, while wearing dig clothes perhaps? Salacious pictures of my moobs?) If you've got other ideas shoot them at me. 
3164	False	a	Pretty much what it says, I would be eternally grateful for a pizza.
3165	False	a	Gonna be a long long night
3166	False	a	Starting a new job Monday but I'm on my bum until then. Friend told me to try here. Could anyone possibly send some deliciousness to me tonight?
3167	False	a	I sort of survived all day yesterday on a jar of crunchy peanut butter, and most if not all of my income is going to a lease that I have to finish for the next two months. I really like playing music, skating, and playing video games, but I don't really have the energy right now. If you guys could help me out, I could probably make the slices last me the week. Thanks for your time.
3168	False	a	Having a very bad week and I have no dinner to eat.   Thanks if you do!
3169	False	a	"Girlfriend and her work buddies are pre-drinking at mine, I cant afford to go out, or buy pizza. But being surrounded by this bitchy, whingy and no doubt at some point tearful selection of ""Ladies"" ( this term is more loose than many of them ). They have invited me to join them out but tbh Socialising with them makes me fear for my IQ.   I get paid on 20th so pizza me today and I pizza you / pay back then ? more of a random loan of pizza !"

I got home tonight and wanted to quit, I get shit from customers on the nightly (I work in a restaurant) and I only make meh money. Don't really have a whole lot else going for me at this point. Could use some pizza... but if not, that's cool too, you guys have a great thing going here. 
3172	False	a	Hi RAOP redditors,  I recently moved up to Kirkland, WA, and due to less than happy circumstances had to move my wife up when our finances were less than ideal in order to get her out of them. While the hope was to move her up when our finances were more stable, it just didn't pan out that way.  The good news is that it meant I got to be with her sooner. The bad news is that it's meant having no money for much food at all - in fact, we ran out of food this evening. We're waiting on some sales on craigslist to get through and see us through the weekend, but it doesn't look like those will happen tonight.  I would be deeply grateful if the pizza fairy made its visit tonight, and so here is my story. Thank you.

3179	False	a	I'm a software developer who is working on contract work week to week and this week... things came up slightly short.  My girlfriend has come over to my place for the evening and she just expressed the want for a pizza and as I sit here looking at my bank account I've realized I'm overdrawn for the week thanks to the dentist.  So I've come looking for a pizza. After being a long time Reddit lurker I've registered and decided it is time to see what happens with this.  Don't worry... I'm verified.
3180	False	a	Hey RAOP. I never thought I'd be here posting. But my week has been terrible. I don't want any sympathy so I will try to keep it sweet and short.  I got laid off Friday, and I'm going to go apply for unemployment until I get back on my feet. I plan on stopping by the pantry Wednesday (next day they are open). I thought the pantry was open today but they are not. I have a 3 year old and that is the only reason why I am posting.  I know posting from a throwaway is frowned upon, but I truly cannot work up enough nerve to reveal my identity. However if someone is willing to help I can give my picture ID, my active accounts name or anything else that's requested. 
3181	False	a	I don't really know what to put here. I guess I will put my favorite pizza combo haha.   Meat lovers with green peppers onions and jalepenos(not sure how to spell this without the line thing). 
3182	False	a	She doesn't know about reddit, but this girl has gone through a lot this year with her recent ex's new relationship being based around making her upset. She's studying for the same exams I am but won't come out of her room for study breaks and she's starting to become an insomniac. Every time we meet up she looks a little bit more depressed and lonely...  I'm sure some good hearted redditors will be able to scrape together a few dollars for this wonderful girl to show her that there are wonderful people out there (as she doesn't believe me or her friends).
3183	True	a	http://www.facebook.com/InstituteSA/posts/270872372947463  There's the link! If I get the most likes I could win myself a sweet buffet dinner today.

3185	False	a	hello Random acts of pizza! im a poor college student and just came across this subreddit, im going to valencia community college near UCF in orlando and i was hoping to eat a warm pizza tonight. Theres not much in my pantry, a couple boxes of ramen and thats about it.  I was a video game tester for 3 years for Electronic Arts but got laid off 7-8 months ago and havent been able to find a job since. If you have any questions about being a video game tester id be happy to answer them for you, i know it interests a lot of people  thank you in advance!

3187	False	a	i dunno how to beg for pizza. my brother and i are sitting inside, i have some work to do in a couple hours which i will be getting a check for, but i can't cash it. tomorrow I should have worked enough to get my bank account up to zero dollars. i don't have a credit card, so the only way I could really pay it forward is by feeding the local vagrants. not having credit sucks, and mom doesn't get paid til friday. it's sad, but i'll have you know the reason i'm sitting here hungry is because I do favors for people and not all of them are able to express their gratitude in the form of money. totally missed out on the free artisan pizza, that would have been epic.   i'm in New Orleans area. my skitzo brother will likely record a rap for you which you can post if u like it. and i'll upvote it.   edit: http://slickdeals.net/forums/showthread.php?t=3350702  also, have a $10 iTunes giftcard for you as well, in the spirit of randomness i'll just post it here in a little while.    XXTSPXBMBTQ3S32M   that's the iTunes code, I'm not hungry I had a booger and fingernail pasta. my bro could still use the pizza and maybe a pack of cigs. I'll delete this post later today... gotta head back over to this lady's house I think she has a rootkit. fml.
3188	True	a	I know I haven't been very active on this site, but I thought I'd give this a shot. I've been out of steady work for about a year now, and this is the first time in 8 years I won't be able to go home for Christmas. I miss my family, miss my friends, miss my steady paycheck, and tonight I'm just plain hungry. Whether this pans out or not, I intend to fulfill another Redditor's request as soon as financially feasible.
3189	False	a	Pretty self explanatory. No sob story ~~and no priding myself on not having a sob story.~~ Embarrassed myself last night and hoping pizza will soothe the pain.

3192	True	a	[I am a miserable failure when it comes to making anything. Even heating up corn dogs.](http://i.imgur.com/IxgXi.jpg)  I was given this convection microwave. I guess i'm not sure how it works fully. But there went my dinner for tonight. I might try corndogs again tomorrow night, as it's the only thing I actually have to eat, but well, tonight i'm a little bit frustrated with the whole corn dog adventures and my microwave (and house) smells like the inside of mordor.  can provide a verification code if need be.  If no one feels the need to help out, no worries. I'll figure something out. My dad bought me a burger for lunch today so I can make it till tomorrow. :) This place is still awesome.  EDIT: Forgot to add that i'm in Utah.
3193	True	a	Currently been living on about 30 dollars for the last week and a half in college, waiting to get my student loan. There's been a strike going on though so I couldn't try to schedule a pickup until this week, and today I learned they still think I'm on my probation from last term (Which I corrected by achieving a high enough GPA and got off probation with the school, but not OSAP).   Anyway, it's going to be a while before I can even pick up that loan but even after all that it will take a little bit before it's deposited to me. A pizza would easily last me a few nights worth of dinner and certainly beat the rice krispies and peanut butter sandwiches I've had for every meal the last week.  Once that loan comes through I'll be sure to pizza it forward if someone comes through for me :)  I'm located in Oakville, Ontario
3194	False	a	Hey, I could really use a pizza.
3195	True	a	"Sup RAoP?  I'm chilling in my room, listening to some music and browsing Reddit. Suddenly I get hungry, and go to the campus pub for a meatball sub and some fries. Unfortunately, due to the lower quantity of students on campus this weekend (we have a four-day weekend this week and almost everyone has gone home,) the pub's hours are different, and when I got there they were already closed. Goddamnit.  Anyway, the first thing that popped into my mind, of course, was ""REDDIT,"" and getting back to my room, the first thing I do is jump onto my computer and go right to RAoP. Now, I'm sitting here, pretty damn hungry, listening to Ensiferum and wondering what I can do to get some delicious pizza in my belly. So here's my offer. I am willing to provide a custom funny drawing of the giver's choice in exchange for a pizza. I'm not looking for anything extravagant as far as the pizza goes, and we have a cheap local place that delivers until midnight. In exchange for said pizza, you receive said drawing. The only other food I have right now is Martin's Salt and Vinegar potato chips, and while they are delicious, they simply aren't much of a meal. Please help this broke sophomore get himself some 'zza?  Help me Random Acts of Pizza, you're my only hope!  EDIT: ANARCHYREIGNS, YOU ROCK! Thanks for the pizza!  EDIT #2: Here's the picture, as promised: http://i.imgur.com/X7Koz.jpg"
3196	False	a	The title basically sums it up. I'm not looking for pity, just a helping hand. I'm a college student and I work part time at a decent job, but things are rough right now.     I've been paying my own bills since I was 17 or so, and have garnered a great deal of respect for the life of the working adult over the past couple of years. You never really appreciate the basics until you realize how much they actually cost. I'm currently putting myself through college while paying every bill that comes my way, so as expected, things are naturally tight. But a couple days ago my car broke down and after paying my internet bill (which was a necessity, since I work from home) I don't even have $1.00 to my name.  I'm not going to be broke forever, but my girlfriend and I are getting really burned out eating rice and ramen. A pizza would be much appreciated and would also be great surprise for my lady when she gets home in the morning (she's been 12 hour night shifts non-stop to help pay our bills, and finance a vacation that we have planned next month)  edit: I'm located in Nevada, USA. Near Las Vegas.   Thanks RAoP, and I'll definitely return the favor when possible :)
3197	False	a	Short and sweet.  Ate shit at the skatepark yesterday, ComEd and RCN cleaned my bank account out.   If anyone has the means can you send me a pizza tonight when I get off work? No extravagance necessary and anything and everything will be appreciated.  Thank you all. 
3198	False	a	I just got home from working a 15 hour shift, now I'm wishing I had some pizza. I recently got 2 flat tires, so getting that fixed so I can go to work on top of all my other bills has left me with $2 U.S. Thanks!!!
3199	False	a	Good evening folks! We sure would love some pizza right about now, but we're too poor to feed our dog anything but carrots, let alone spare some change for a tasty slice of some pizza pie! How 'bout it? There's 3 of us and we like pineapple
3200	False	a	I'm not that great of an artist , but I will use my trusty Wacom tablet to doodle you anything of your choosing.  I'm quite certain that me and my brother won't have much to eat today.  A pizza would go a long way for this broke college student!  Once I get my college check I will be sure to pizza it forward!  *EDIT  I am located in Gray , TN!
3201	False	a	If you look at my previous post you will be able to see my story, since then things have settled a little, the stress is still high but overall I am looking at things more positive, I would love to be able to get a pizza to relax this weekend without having to worry too much about food.
3202	False	a	Hanging out, alone in my apartment with my cats, and if I eat ramen noodles one more time I might throw up. Would appreciate something real to eat. My account has been in the red for pretty much the last month. Just got my electricity turned back on since I have a deadbeat roommate... I'll pay it forward as soon as I can.
3203	False	a	I live in Tucson, AZ, and came out of work to find a small tree on the hood of my car after this afternoon's lovely storm. Fixing this is going to be the rest of my money until payday on Friday, and I'm just hoping that there's someone out there thinking about passing on a pizza. I'm a big believer in karma, and I'm hoping that she's going to be kind to me after the past few weeks of absolute shit. UGH. Right before my vacation, too :(
3204	False	a	I'd love you guys forever and of course return the favor. 
3205	False	a	Yo.  So I'm about to move across the country (Florida to Pennsylvania) with my girlfriend, and I just paid the deposit on the new place, first month's rent, and the pro-rate for my current apartment, so I've been stretched ramen-thin for a week and a half or so. I don't get paid 'till Friday, and a pizza would be pretty sweet.   Not gonna lie; I won't starve if I don't get one, but it's been a pretty stressful week, and it'd help the ol' morale. I've done the verification system and such.  Thanks!
3206	False	a	The girlfriend and I were sitting at home and after repeatedly checking the cabinets she decided she'd rather be hungry than eat any more Ramen. Personally I could eat the stuff every day for another couple of months, but she's a little more high maintenance than I am. We're in between checks and had a ticket (10 over) recently that got rid of nearly all my disposable income. She'd deeply appreciate the gooey cheesy deliciousness and I really wouldn't mind myself! 
3207	False	a	I love pizza, and haven't had it in ages as it's too expensive for me....then I found this site.  I'll be soooo happy to receive one! :)
3208	True	a	If anyone can help at all, I'd appreciate it more than you can imagine.  Edit: spelling error.
3209	True	a	Not doing anything this weekend and I would love to be the recipient of a  delicious sausage and pepperoni pie from any of the chain restaurants. I already used my free code from Papa Johns last week. Thanks!
3210	False	a	I am here because my 5 year old son has been sick off and on since just before Thanksgiving. He has had everything from strep throat (3x), ear infections (3x), sinus infection, pink eye, and the flu. He has now had vomiting and diarrhea and intermittent fevers since January. He has had several blood tests and labs done and we're hopefully getting the results back tomorrow. He has been tested from everything from food allergies and parasites to some pretty serious diseases. As of yesterday he has been feeling a bit better and is feeling up to eating something other than soup. I told him a while ago that once he was feeling better he could have whatever he wanted. Well, my little man has chosen pizza and unfortunately I just don't have the funds to do this right now. (only have a dollar and some change in the bank) So, I'm hoping someone can be my little boys pizza hero before he's not feeling up to eating.
3211	False	a	Hey! Both of us havent got time to cook much, and yesterday, i made a realllllly shitty pizza, and spent all the flour i had left on it.  Thanks a lot! 
3212	False	a	 Please help. You're my only hope.  I live in Asheville, North Carolina. No work, no food. Got a job interview tomorrow, will pay it forward once a paycheck comes in,
3213	True	a	My autistic nephew had his 15th birthday yesterday. I bought him some Dora The Explorer DVDs for him.   On my way home from work I stopped by Walmart to grab a frozen pizza but was declined at the register.   There's a Soul Food fund raiser at work tomorrow where I can eat, and then I get paid on Thursday. However tonight I've got nothing.  I'm requesting just a basic pizza to eat tonight with some slices I can save for breakfast. Since I get paid on Thursday I can totally pay it forward. It would really help me out guys, and I'd really like to return the favor.   Thanks for taking the time to read this. And my nephew loved the DVDs. His sister looks like Dora, so he gets very excited when watching them since he cant live with his 'real' family. He's a former student of my sister who took him in from his parents who couldn't take care of him. Long story, but I don't mind answering any questions about it. 
3214	False	a	I would be so thankful if someone would send me a pizza any kind! any type! I haven't really had the problem of not having money for food until recently, it sucks.
3215	False	a	I have been at school for 2 weeks with a personal check from my dad, and no bank account. I cannot cash this check and have no usable money at present. I bummed a 1.50 so I could enjoy a soda today, living on cafeteria food, water, and lemonade.
3216	False	a	I am actually in no longer commissioner, but now a broke college study whose last final is tomorrow.  I could really use a good pizza right now as all my money has gone to putting a down payment on a house and tuition for next semester. Life's a garden, dig it.  
3217	False	a	Test
3218	False	a	First time on Random Acts of Pizza, my wallet was stolen out of my car today and I am in a very miserable mood.  I am hungry and if someone would be so kind to give me a random act of pizza I would be very grateful.  In the future when I am in a more financially stable position I will remember the generosity and pass on the good deeds. BTW I &lt;3 Dominos pizza. Thanks!
3219	False	a	I just brought pizza to a friend who has gone through a lot lately and is in the psych ward. Made me really wish I had enough money to get all the guys in there pizza. If the hospital near any of you is like mine, it'll have a pretty small inpatient psych ward that a couple pizzas would probably cover. Believe me folks, psych ward patients could all use a slice of 'za
3220	False	a	Hoping to get a pizza before I just go to the library without eating anything today :)  love and pizza Dom 
3221	False	a	Just as the title says. I miss calculated my living expensive and ran out by May. Ive been living off student loan money since I've been having trouble with finding work. I had to sell just about everything of value except my phone and damaged tablet just to pay rent for the last few months. I just topped off my bag of rice and down to Oatmeal and a bag of Beans. I get this semester of loans in 2 weeks, but a Dominos pizza would make this US student very happy. Even just breadsticks would do.    Sorry for my long sob story.
3222	False	a	I'm out of cash, and only have $1.38 in SNAP benefits left. Anything would be great. 
3223	False	a	I live in a small town that just doesn't have a Papa Johns. I have a code for a free PJ Large 1 topping, was hoping to trade since the nearest one is 30 min from me. Thanks to you guys and your subreddit.
3224	False	a	[This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO3U56gTi2U) is what I'll be listening to for the next while hoping that my request reaches an open heart.  I have no money, little food, and high hopes of receiving a pizza.  I'll draw you a cool pizza-related picture!
3225	False	a	a RAOPizza would be nice diversion from heat transfer/fluid mechanics/and materials processing.
3226	False	a	So yeah. My girlfriend of two years left me a couple of weeks ago and I'm pretty much alone with my 3 cats playing Super Nintendo. I'd love some pizza before I leave tomorrow morning, but I have zero money on me after all the holiday gift buying.  Thanks for reading and have a happy holiday!
3227	False	a	My girlfriend and I wouldn't mind a nice pizza - normally I'd have plenty to eat but the bank happens to be closed today so no cash for me :( any takers?  Ill be sure to buy someone a pie in the future   to clarify,  we haven't received our fridge yet either 
3228	False	a	We just moved to the area, and as a result of putting down a huge deposit on our new home and getting in a recent accident, and my wife starting a new job that turned out to be the opposite of what she was told, we are broke and stressed. She just texted me and said she really would like some pizza and wine for dinner tonight just to relax her nerves, but we don't have enough right now to afford either.   I really want to give her a break tonight, she does so much for us and she really deserves something to make her feel better after a long and stressful week. Thanks!  EDIT: We have a Pizza Hut nearby, so feel free to use a Pizza Hut ecard: https://pizzahut.cashstar.com/gift-card/buy/?ref=ph1 
3229	True	a	Hey RAOP, I'm college student living with a couple friends right now. After having about a dollar in my bank account for about 4 weeks I finally started working last week and will get paid on Friday. Unfortunately we are running out of food, and a pizza sounds just wonderful right about now. If anyone out there is willing to help us out, we'd be forever grateful! :) 
3230	True	a	We have no running air conditioner and the thought of having to turn the oven on turns my stomach. We don't have much to eat our food stamps don't come in for a few more days. If anyone could send us a pizza i would be very grateful. Thank you. God Bless!  Roxanne and Lilly
3231	False	a	Hello, right now I have my newborn daughter in my left arm as I type this with my right. If released even for a moment she will start screaming very loudly for a twelve-day-old person.   I would like to humbly submit my request for a free pizza. Cooking a meal has been...difficult shall we say and both my wife and I are very tired of Ramen Noodles and Lean Cuisine.  I know Papa John's has a deal this weekend but Dominos is the only place that delivers to my address in my area.   Thank you in advance!
3232	False	a	Okay, so me and my roommate are in a sticky situation. We both don't get paid until Thursday, and we haven't eaten all day. We also don't have much food left in the house, just chips and snacky stuff. My mom cant help me with money until tomorrow night and her parents don't even live close to us. A Egift card for pizza would work wonders right now.  - i posted this already just a few minutes ago but i cant see it for some reason, so im posting it again to see if it works
3233	False	a	So yeah, new to this sub-reddit.. Jobless and alone for turkey day.. I don't even know if they are open on thanksgiving.. probably not right? Anyway, I'm in North Mankato, MN.. if anyone would like to help, I would really appreciate it, and hopefully in about a month, I'll be able to pay back, or even help out another reddit-or..   Thanks for reading, hope you all have a happy holiday, even if you don't celebrate :) 
3234	False	a	Hey guys,  I work part time, go to school, and I support my disabled mom who would be homeless otherwise. I'm dead broke ($0.64 in my bank account, I think) till I get paid on tuesday and there is no food in my fridge/pantry (I bought mom a few days worth of groceries yesterday).  I'd love to have a pizza or two to get me through till tuesday when I get paid. I'll pay it forward in january when things should be looking up for both myself and my mom.  Edit: I didn't post on my regular reddit name because I didn't want it out there on that name I'm having issues. If you want, though, I'll give you that name and send you a PM from it.  Edit: **THANK YOU!!!**  I got a pizza gift card, and that person wishes to remain anonymous. 
3235	False	a	Just graduated school and am looking for a job I can hopefully call my career. Any help would be greatly appreciated and I will definitely pay it forward!
3236	True	a	(First time on RAOP so sorry if i messed up the format/rules)  I'm currently down on my luck due to my roommate moving out, and my cat getting really sick (She ended up having hyperthyroidism (Damn rare in cats, i won the sick cat lottery!)) [picture of the sick kitty](http://i.imgur.com/PPAW8.jpg).   She's doing just fine right now thankfully. Though the medication is 58$/m (and thats if they are nice and drop the visit fee like they did last time which in of itself is 43$) until they get the dosage right then back down to 20~$/m (depending on dosage, probably be a bit more, i'm expecting 34$/m if the current dosage works)  I'm just wanting a pizza or two i can eat to raise my spirits (it's the even last finals week for my bachelors! Damn you Murphy's Law) and have something tasty eat while i try and de-stress and work on getting another job while 
3237	True	a	I hate having to ask for help like this, but this is really my last option.  I recently had to take my dog to the vet to have a growth on her leg checked.  The exam was $50, the biopsy was $50.  Then the battery in my car went out.  Jumping it worked for awhile, but then a few days ago it stopped holding any charge.  New battery was another $100.  For the past 3 days, my husband and I have been subsisting on pasta.  Yesterday we ran out of pasta sauce, so I can still eat it, but it's so bland and I'm getting tired of it.  Plus, I still breastfeed my son, otherwise I would deal with the blandness, but when my diet tanks, my supply tanks.  (We are in Indianapolis)  Thanks for reading, let me know if I need to give any more information.  **EDIT** [mr-smor is a lifesaver!!](http://i.imgur.com/VLRyn.jpg)
3238	False	a	In between paychecks and no food left in the apt. I have been trying to ration the food I had left to last until next week. Turns out I miss calculated. I have been out of a job for about 2 months now and just got another one a couple weeks ago, my next paycheck should be enough to cover everything, but until then I'm flat broke and can't even afford the gas to put in my bike to get to work. A nice hot meal other than the ramen Ive been eating would be nice right now. Any help?
3239	False	a	&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; 
3240	False	a	I've been debating whether to post here or not, because I am just beyond shocked. My boss called this morning and said they company had to let me go. He said they had to let several people go and because I was newer I guess I would be one of the first to go. I just started a month ago and had been looking for work for 4 months. I don't know what to tell the wife as I've been at the computer most of the day trying to take my mind off of it while looking for work. I'm hoping she will take the news as best as she can over a good meal. We're not without food, but I know that she loves pepperoni and mushroom pizza.   What's left in the bank and what's coming in the next check will all go to bills, so I really have no way of treating her to her favorite. I've worked hard to provide for my family, but I feel like less of a man when I can't. I'm hoping someone can help me treat my wife to her favorite and that she will handle the situation well. Thank you for reading and understanding.
3241	False	a	Fellow ents,  I am currently in a pickle.  I went out last night and forgot to close my tab before I left the bar.  Currently, however, I am too high to go and get it from the bar.  Simultaneous, my state has made me very hungry and would love to order people.  Alas, I can't because I don't have my card.  If any of you can find it in your heart to help me out, I promise to pay it forward when the time comes.
3242	True	a	Howdy out there, just a simple request; my mom is staying late tonight in an attempt to get ahead at the first of the month, and was wondering if I could get some pizza for my brother, sister and I. I would normally do something like this myself, but I haven't been able to nail down a job and between the three of us, there is about six dollars to split. :P If anyone could help out, I would greatly appreciate it.
3243	False	a	Collegedale, TN. I am trying to get my MBA, going to classes full-time and working 2 jobs. 
3244	False	a	My girlfriend isn't having the best day. What would really help is if some one would help me get her a stuffed crust pizza that would make her day!  *edit: I am in the Tucson, Arizona area.
3245	True	a	Hi,  I live in Glasgow, UK and I have no money to buy food until Monday. I am hungry. Could a kind Redditor please order me a pizza today from http://www.dominos.co.uk   The pizza costs ¬£11.49. I have about ¬£3.25 in my paypal account I can send you.   The pizza I would die to eat right now is:  Meatilicious Pepperoni, ham, chicken breast strips, smoked bacon rashers, cumberland sausage  Looks like this: http://imgur.com/fFxxt  Small (6 slices), ¬£11.49  Can anyone help?
3246	False	a	Hey, I live in Bremerton, Washington and currently I'm babysitting my cousins for about a week while my aunt goes on vacation with her husband, My grandpa currently has the money and he only spends the money on beer and cigerattes and we're almost out completely. I was hoping that someone would be kind enough to buy a pizza for us, as we're knd of sick of cereal. ;-;
3247	False	a	See above :) It'll probably take me a while to save up enough money as I don't make a lot. In the meantime, I'm stuck on food stamps and can't really afford a nice, hot pizza. Getting sent one would really be appreciated! :)
3248	False	a	"I was looking up for possibility of free pizza and ran across the reddit free pizza at first was hesitant but I thought I give it a try. My girlfriend and I are in a tough spot, my job has yet to pay me my ""lost"" hours and we are behind with some bills. We have enough money to pay for rent tomorrow but it may be a week or so before we will get above. Does anyone have it in their heart to provide a pizza for us? In return we will pay it forward to your choosing (I have just thought of a unique idea paying it forward) If interested I will share it with you. Thanks for taking the time to read this."
3249	False	a	Just 3 college age kids who don't get paid for another week, contrary to what we were told by our boss Edit: Sorry for no location, we are in Michigan
3250	False	a	Title pretty much explains it all, I am in fact dirt broke, I've even started putting up anything valuable on ebay. I probably won't have a dime for another week or two, my mom also just told me she has a pancreatic tumor that has spread to her liver, I'm just down in general right now. I would love the comfort food of pizza, especially now that I can't even afford to stick to my paleo diet. 
3251	True	a	My wife and I are both full time students. She has an all-day class today and will be out of the house until 7:00 PM. I'm a graphic design student with 2 major projects to finish by Monday.   I feel terrible for my kids (7, 5, &amp; 4). They are doing so good entertaining themselves while we get ready for finals, and I wish I could do something for them. But we are completely broke (students, after all). Would someone mind treating them to some delicious pizza?
3252	False	a	Got caught in the Trader Joes dumpster tonight and was yelled at by the security. Wasn't able to get any food and my fridge is entirely empty 
3253	True	a	Reddit I've been eating linguine (which I don't know when and why I bought) for dinner and lunch for the past 3 days since it's the only thing left in my apartment.  Proof of culinary skills: http://i.imgur.com/50K2L.jpg  I would be delighted if I could taste a pizza or something better tonight, can you please help me? :D  I can PM you the verification code.  Thanks guys!
3254	False	a	me and my best friend are stuck at her brothers house while they are on vacation. We are going to be up all night studying for our finals for our summer classes. A pizza would be a great treat. 
3255	False	a	My roommate and I finished our finals today, of course we had one at the last timeslot (U of I has a terrible final schedule this year). We'd like to celebrate but it's starting to storm pretty bad out at the moment. A pizza would be delicious, this semester was a rough one. Pretty please? :) I'll gladly pay it forward to a college kid who asks next time around.
3256	False	a	I get paid at the end of the month,  the final week is always a struggle.  I could ration a pizza, if I had a pizza.   I'm willing to return the favor then, or I can take a funny pictures involving cats and pizza. 
3257	True	a	Sup RAOPists,   So I'm in Bellingham hanging out with MY GIRLFRIEND and was curious if this RAOP thing worked. We just finished a 6 mile hike and don't have much money to spare. We decided if we could convince any kind soul to donate a pizza to us, that would be flippin sweet, and we'll pay it forward later in the future when we have more $$$. Anyone?  EDIT: pizza order has been placed by a person who prefers to remain anonymous. Thank you muchlies, good sir or madam!  EDIT 2: And now with a picture! http://i.imgur.com/G9Rog.jpg We got a large pizza with half Hawaiian and half cheese, cuz Heather is a lame vegetarian who also dislikes pineapple.  Peace love and hugs, -Scott and Heather
3258	False	a	I've been without a job since the middle of August, so I've been living off of what's been left of my savings account. I've been living off of bagels and yogurt for the past month or so, and I really want a pizza to liven things up (and it'll feed me both tonight and tomorrow, too). As a college student who doesn't have a meal plan, this would mean a lot to me.  I'll gladly pizza you (or someone else on this subreddit, if you want) at an equal value at a later date, once I get a job and my first paycheck. I'm hearing back from an interview later this week, so it could be pretty soon that I pizza you back.  Thank you for reading, and I'd love to be able to give to this subreddit once I have money.
3259	False	a	I'm off work and uni with glandular fever which has caused badly swollen glands and is making me look like the elephant woman (can prove with pictures) :( I'm craving a pizza and just can't afford one right now, got no food in the house and too tired to get out of bed to walk and get something to eat.  Edit: Will try pay it forward when I can!
3260	False	a	Well, the title pretty much explains it. At around 8pm Pacific time my neighbor and I are having a Halo 2 System-Link party until around 2am. Currently my neighbor only has chips to snack on for the party so it would be pretty wicked if someone helped us out by sending some random pizza!
3261	True	a	My husband got deployed last month and I decided to use all my food money on the best possible gift for him since he is sacrificing so much for me. I have been living on that crap at the back of the cupboards for the last two weeks, and am pretty much out-the only thing left is a box of macaroni and cheese, but no milk or butter to make it with  Yesterday I got a conformation email from UPS saying the package was delivered saturday...it was not. We decided to wait until today to see if the package was just at the local office, but it didn't come today either. The package is gone. I'm in an apartment complex (in California, neer the bay area) and I think the UPS guy left it at the door and someone snagged it.   I'm not used to asking strangers for anything...but I am on the verge of a break down and haven't eaten anything filling in weeks.   We are usually fine when it comes to money, so once our paycheck on the 15th comes I will send a pizza back to whoever sends me one today.   TL;DR (yes, I know I'm a ranter) my husbands deployed, I'm depressed, his awesome christmas gift was stolen, and now I have no money for groceries. If you send me pizza I will return the favor when my paycheck comes. 
3262	False	a	I'm quite poor at the moment, I still owe my brother for rent, and I could really use a pizza if at all possible. I can draw somewhat well, so I'd be willing to trade a digital sketch or something for some 'za. Please and thanks!
3263	True	a	My wonderful buddy LainIwakura came to my rescue, so I'll be eating tonight :3 Thanks to all you anyway!  This'll be as short as possible since typing is a bit painful (I am also a programmer, the irony), I'm 19, former CS student, but the past year my arthritis (rheumatoid, and osteo in the right knee) has gotten bad enough I had to drop out of uni, leave my job, and recently got the power cut in my apartment- currently I'm house-sitting at my parent's who are on vacation, but they've sort of kept an empty fridge since they've left for 3 weeks and I've come to the conclusion rum is not a proper substitute for food.  I'm in Ontario (Windsor to be exact), so this might be a bit of a pain, and I'm not sure I how I can pay you back, save paying it forward when I'm not at rock bottom. Honestly I'm not even sure where to get pizza around here :3  Thanks regardless to you lovely people for this sub even existing!
3264	False	a	we are broke and she has no health insurance and we are starting to freak out about how we will pay this bill when it comes. She is a wreck and all i want to do is see her smile and there is one thing that does this and it is pepperoni pizza. Thank You RAOP!   P.S. She doesnt know i am trying to do this, and she is a redditor but doesnt know of this subreddit, so let's keep this between us for now.
3265	False	a	I lost my job, maybe someone would help a couple out?
3266	False	a	Pre-Law, if I make it through (wouldn't count on it if I were you but there's a chance) you get free law stuff. My ferrari lost its traction control and I lost my dads visa black card so hard to eat.
3267	False	a	Just moved into a new apartment with my GF and we've spent all our monies on the moving truck, ridiculous deposits, down payments, and other 'security' fees. Payday is a few days away but we're really craving a good pizza. Can Reddit help us settle in tonight?
3268	True	a	I'm supposed to go home in two weeks (Europe) and I lost my credit card on Tuesday. I'm working on getting it back but it's going to take a couple of days. Haven't eaten anything but spaghetti with pepper the last two days so if anyone is feeling like buying me a pizza I promise to return the favor when I get my card back!  Edit: I got a gift card for a couple of pizzas! Reddit you're amazing!
3269	True	a	I've been staying with my cousin for a few days. I'm broke and have been running off the very minimum. I would feel wrong about taking from his cupboard, as it is nearly empty as well. Perhaps we could both appreciate some pizza.
3270	False	a	"Hello: I'm not going to try to make this a ""SOB"" Story lol but it's one long day until the 1st of the month, and the kids are sick and tired of hot dogs, mac and cheese and ramons noodles. We are very hungry for pizza.  It will hold us over soo much you can only imagine...  I'm praying that someone will really satisfy our tummies thanks so much for reading. This is the first time I've been on this site... Thank you..."
3271	False	a	Hello reddit  A friend of mine showed me this website the other day and today he told me that one of you might be able to help me with my dilemma.  Apparently I accumulated enough points in Papa John's to get a free pizza, but I sadly don't have the cash to pay for the delivery free, tip and taxes that are involved with the order.  Can one of you guys help me out with this?  Thanks and keep rocking people with pizza!
3272	True	a	I'm not due to go back to my job until next week. I've been off for hand surgery. I'm broke, my temporary food stamps have run out until the 10th, and my parents can't put $20 into my account until the bank re-opens Tuesday (Monday is a bank holiday). Can someone please help?  Also, this account is a throwaway. I'm embarrassed and I don't want my friends to see. I will be happy to give you my other user name and PM you from that account for proof. Thanks for reading. 
3273	False	a	So tomorrow I hit 19 (3/3/1993) and I'm having a party with a few friends of mine the day after. Unfortunately, I'm a college student and all my friends are in about the same situation. What I'm getting at is, we have no cash to do anything on Sunday. If a fellow Redditor were to hook us up with a pizza then I would go through their comments and upvote everything they've ever posted. What say you?
3274	False	a	PizzaReceived see you in a few weeks RAoP And thank you so much ;)
3275	False	a	So this is my roommate and my last night living together, we will both be going home which is about 3-4 hours apart. We've been friends since middle school and probably wont be able to hang out anymore (at least for a long time). We both recently left our jobs (I helped him get one on campus where I work). I worked their for 2 years and he worked there for a year. It would be nice to commemorate our final night of living together.
3276	True	a	My SO is the only one working right since I'm still looking for work. He has spent all of the money on bills and the hell hole apartment and now we are both sitting around trying to figure out what to do for food. We have tried to find people on Craigslist to buy our backwards compatible hacked PS3 but the only replies we got were from scams. In short, a pizza sounds so good right now and it sure can raise our hope and morale too. Please Reddit, a pizza pie for two hungry people?   **Edit!** Thanks to mkeanon my Sunday is looking better.
3277	False	a	Got evicted a few weeks ago due to my dad and I (we're roomates) falling upon difficult financial times. Thanks to the generosity of some friends, I've had a place to stay for the last 2 weeks.  However, things are getting really tight as I wait for my next paycheck to be deposited (the 5th). I already feel overextended with the friends who have been lodging me, and would prefer not to have to ask them for money/food as well.  If there are any redditors out there who are in a position to help, I would be extremely grateful and will do my best to reciprocate the favor. A pizza will most definitely get me through to my next paycheck and keep me afloat. Verification code / address / pics / anything else you want available upon request!  I'm very grateful to even have a place to ask for help, so thank you very, very much.   -Nick  *EDIT: I deleted my initial post because of some formatting errors (no request tag or location)*
3278	False	a	I thought I had enough to get some more ramen, but it turns out that I used my remaining quarters to do laundry. I do get paid Friday, but until then I'll be at the mercy of my hunger pangs. A little pizza would go a long way. Reddit, help a brother out!
3279	False	a	I got a little over ambitious with my Christmas gift spending this year for my family and girlfriend and now I'm out of money until I get my paycheck tomorrow at my internship. I'm at work now and I would have to be here for 10 more hours without food unless I get help. I was hoping someone could help me out since I work right next to a Pizza Hut and could run over there to grab some lunch and dinner. Thanks for any help!
3280	False	a	Hello there! Long time lurker of Reddit, this sub inspired me to finally sign up. As post says, craving just a pepperoni pizza from Papa Johns and I don't get paid until next week. Not feeling ramen tonight, and I'd be happy to return the favor next week!! I'm in central PA if that matters.
3281	False	a	morning out there my family is hoping for pizza tonight but the wallet is empty its been over six months since had pizza or have even gotten to go out to eat. please can anybody help my family have a pizza dinner tonight
3282	False	a	Will return the favor to a random person on reddit 
3283	False	a	My debit card overdrew last night, and there's very little to eat here besides rice and corn tortillas. I'll have money on Monday, but I'd like to just eat something with flavor tonight.  Edit: I should have specified, I was hoping for just a cheese pizza from pizza hut or dominos. If you're feeling especially generous, a stuffed crust would be magical.
3284	False	a	Hi there, my oven broke a while ago so naturally ordered a new one. Someone corgi registered needs to install it and with payday not being till tomorrow I have been cooking on an open fire in my garden, don't get me wrong I loved doing it....for a while. My family is away for the night and I can't bear to cook on a fire again lol. Some pizza would be awesome. Naturally I would return the favour to someone else in need of pizza tomorrow evening. Thanks fir reading guys and girls.EDIT: also just noticed its my 2nd cakeday :) (thanks to Baconit)
3285	False	a	Im just riding it out until next Friday and I'm tired of eating grapes and popcorn. 
3286	True	a	Thank you for taking time to read my post all the money my family has at the moment has gone towards the things I need for college while I wait for my financial aid check. I really expected to get it today but I didn't so now my family And I have no money to eat. I can pay someone back or pay it forward or both as soon as I get my check.
3287	False	a	I'm in between jobs right now and am living in a house for free, as long as I get my own food since there isn't much to go around. Long story short, I'm out of savings and stuff to sell and still haven't been able to get another job, and for the past few days haven't had anything to eat. Any pizza, even if it's a small cheese, would be amazing. I can do most freshman/sophomore college level work, especially math up to calculus, if anyone would like that in return but don't really have anything else besides eternal gratitude and a promise to pay it forward when I can. Thanks for reading!
3288	False	a	Wyoming, USA. I would love a pie right now, I'm starving.  When I get back on my feet I'll be more than happy to give back.  But for now, all I can do is ask.
3289	True	a	In a nutshell, 2 months ago I sold my car to cycle to work and yesterday night the rear derailleur of my Trek Madone sheared off and I crashed into a bus shelter full of kids (no kids were hurt, but they laughed).   I have to spend my last ¬£60 on repairs whilst nursing a bruised ego.  I only have freezer food until Friday and some pizza would go a long way to making me feel better.    I will forward or pay back as soon as I get paid this Friday, promise.  Thanks for reading.  EDIT: image of the derailleur http://i.imgur.com/zxM9oXl.jpg 
3290	False	a	I've never been this happy in years. Yesterday, I finally made it to school for the first time in 2 years. I have social phobia and depression and I would never even step foot outside my apartment, even to walk my dog. After years of therapy and medication, I somehow managed to gather up my courage and start a new life for myself.      I would love to celebrate with a pizza! I really wish I could provide proof, but I'm not sure how I can prove this kind of stuff. I can say, however that I live in NY.     Thank you all so much for even reading this, I really appreciate it.  Much love &lt;3  edit: formatting
3291	False	a	Finals are upon me once again and between my lovely empty bank account and a school that puts me on a limited number of swipes a day, pizza sounds amazing.  
3292	False	a	Hello, I was thrown through some hoops at my old job, which resulted in me not working for a whole month (without any heads up that i would not be working). I was smart with what money I had left and paid my next months rent and groceries. I am starting to run out of food now and will not be able to purchase any for another week. If anyone would be kind enough to brighten my day with a pizza, I would GREATLY appreciate it and pass on the good deed once I get back on my feet.
3293	False	a	needing pizza to help feed my 3 young cousins and keep them quiet so I can focus on the RWC! Can anyone help?
3294	True	a	I was laid off a few weeks ago, but ndb as I found a new job. Neither paid a lot, but my savings was depleted over the last few weeks while working my new job. Now I am gainfully employed, but have no cash until I get paid on Friday. I could sure use some pizza love to fill my tummy until payday.  Thanks for any help, fellow redditors.   Edit: I got a pie! Thank you, paulinator! 
3295	False	a	I turned 25 today! Looking for some nice birthday pizza for my family. Were staying in chicago tonight at my sisters apartment and would love some pies. :) there are nine of us, but even one pizza would be nice.  Thanks in advance- verification can be provided if needed.
3296	False	a	Hey! Just got off my retail job that im working until i finish my teaching certification (hs math/physics).   Been eating peanut butter sandwiches for a few days now until i get paid at the end of the week.  Would really appreciate it and would repay the favor soon!  Thank you! May The Flying Spaghetti Monster grace you with his noodly appendage!
3297	False	a	I am currently at work, surrounded by people who make more than I do for doing less work.  My job stresses me out so much and 95% of my money goes towards bills/paying for daycare for my baby girl.  To top it off, my work just switched to bi-weekly pay and I literally have $12.32 in my checking account to last me until Friday.  Due to lack of finances, my boyfriend and I have not been out to eat/gotten take out in almost a year and would love a meal that I don't have to cook.  I'll pay it forward as soon as I have a little extra cash... promise!
3298	False	a	So after 40 weeks, it's finally here!  Baby Boy should be making an appearance some time in the next week!  (This is our first) I am showing pretty much no pre-labor signs, except for being a little crampy and irritable, last night I had about 5 braxton hicks contractions.  My fiance is working all day and we unfortunately are living paycheck to paycheck (which is a bit easier when I am actually able to work) and have every penny pinched for the baby.  I am crazy craving some pizza,  I have a bad gluten intolerance (almost had to be hospitalized the last time I ate normal pizza, it was the last glutenous thing I purposefully ate before I made the switch to gluten free everything), so I know that makes it a bit more difficult (and expensive :( ), but I do live in Portland, OR so there are a couple of gluten free places (like hot lips or Bellagios) that do deliver.  I would love you forever and ever and ever and I could craft you something if you'd like.  I haven't had many cravings this entire pregnancy (except meat, I was vegetarian before I got pregnant, now I am a carnivore) and now it is pizza overload.  Someone help a pregnant girl (who is not royal by any means) out?
3299	True	a	I may have gotten my subreddits mixed up, is there a difference between this one and /r/randomactsofpizza?  Oh well, might as well try both...  So a little over 3 weeks ago I lost my job, and I THOUGHT I had another job lined up, but unfortunately that fell through. I've been barely making a meal a day out of bare bones food (ramen, rice, beans) and have no money to buy anything else at the moment. The job hunt is not going as smoothly as I had hoped, and apparently I have to wait until NEXT week for unemployment to give me anything, which will go mostly to my rent.   With every day I don't get a new job my situation seems bleaker and bleaker. And the fact that I've been barely surviving on a meager portion of tasteless crap every day is not helping my outlook on life. I don't think I could write the words that would properly convey what a nice, crispy, cheesy pizza would do to boost my spirits, and I don't want to get my hopes too far up by typing it out.  All I'm gonna say is, if any kind soul out there would send some pizza my way (I'm in NYC, btw) it would mean the world to me.
3300	True	a	I'm on my own and have no family to speak of, I'm alone in Florida and have $5.48 left to my name for gas to get to and from work. I lost my job due to downsizing but thankfully got a new one soon after - the only problem is they pay you bi weekly. I started on the 9th of this month and don't get my paycheck until this Thursday - the 26th. I only have enough bread left to have one sandwich a day until then. I want nothing more right now than a Domino's Philly Cheese Steak pizza and a 20oz bottle of cherry coke and I swear to celebrate my first paycheck by giving someone else a pizza as soon as I can. Please help me before I start to cry strawberry jelly.
3301	False	a	Been a lurker for some time, figured I'd give it a shot. Nothing special about me. Just moved to San Francisco and don't know many people, so I figured I'd just stay in tonight and hope for some cheesy goodness. :)
3302	False	a	Today, has been a shitty day, starting out with me falling asleep during an exam and not even answering 25-30 of the 96 questions after studying for most of the night, becoming ill shortly afterwards and missing my crew practice today due to the fact I missed the shuttle between campuses at 12:00 and missed the carpool for my crew team. On said shuttle I took at 1:00, I left my iPod. Here I sit hoping someone will contact me saying they have it. So ROAP'ers can y'all please brighten my day with a pizza?
3303	False	a	Hi everyone I am in louisville ky and I am wishing for someone to please help us out for dinner tonight ..Me and my daughter are hungry and we would love some pizza for dinner..We get foodstamps but they dont come until tomorrow the 7th ..please and we have no food and are very hungry..thanks for reading
3304	True	a	I am requesting a pizza for dinner. My hubby is in the ICU unit,.He had a sezuier and hit his head. They had to do emergency Brain surgery, He is medical coma. Its to early to tell what is going to happen to him. If you cant do a pizza, Please sent good thoughts his way .  Why am I on the internet? I am trying to keep my mind busy, Thanks :]
3305	True	a	Normally I would have been fine but some expenses popped up unexpectedly that I had to pay and now I'm going to get late fees on my internet bill because I couldn't fully pay it off. The only food I currently have are condiments, which aren't appetizing my themselves &gt;.&lt;  I will be able to pay it back on Sunday though! I would really appreciate if you could help, thank you!  **EDIT: Thank you ReillyBoy for the wonderful two pizza's!**  I'll be msging you again on Sunday for repayment :)  **EDIT2: How embarrassing, I was able to pay it back the next day &gt;.&lt;**
3306	False	a	I just bought 4 GBs of new RAM to make it run better, but it's still unplayable. I was looking forward to playing multiplayer with my brother. Needless to say, I'm pretty disappointed. I'm in Utah County.
