it's only just the seventh, and we have already exhausted our snap for the month.  (and on that note, i have heard mixed reports that this asinine government shut down may delay or cut the benefit entirely.)  we are going to one of our two regular food banks tomorrow.  rent is half of my take home income, so effectively i get paid once a month, and my employer pays my landlord the other half of the month.   and i have had less than $30 in checking for the last five or six days that i need to stretch until i get paid friday.working full time but living in check-to-check poverty is an american nightmare sometimes.  for two and a half years my meager emt income has been supporting myself and my girlfriend - who graduated with a nursing masters in august, and starts work in february - in one of the most expensive cities in america.  i was generally feeling okay today, until we were walking home from the grocery store just now (where we just finished off some produce vouchers from the food bank on fruits and veggies,) and passed a little local pizza joint. two other people walking by it, without an ounce of concern or hesitation or reluctance, just said ""hey wanna grab a slice real quick,"" and as easy as that elected to go sit down and have some tasty pizza, as if the decision was of no consequence and totally carefree, and they totally stumbled upon it.  i'm hungry, here's pizza, i'll eat pizza.

how could something as simple as that be so far removed from my present lived experience?  i am getting constant reminders of how things i used to take for granted, little simple pleasures in life, were such luxuries.

i am dreading going into work this week so low on emotional solvency, and some simple comfort food vis a vis a raop would go a long way toward filling our bellies with pizza, and our hearts with the emotional resources necessary to take on the rest of this week (tonight is kinda my sunday, since i work four tens tuesday through friday.)

we would greatly appreciate a kind offer of assistance at this moment in time, and would relish an opportunity to pay it forward down the line when our living situation changes soon (she starts early feb, and we have been counting down the days, and budgeting that first pay check for weeks!)

thanks for reading, and have a great rest of your day and week and 2019!

because of this, we have depleted our savings and lost our apartment in the time that i've been trying to find work, and recently began staying with my father in law who lives off of social security.

i am currently waiting for supplemental nutrition benefits to be deposited as well as my first paycheck which i will not receive until next wednesday. we have no idea when the supplemental funds will be available and though it's easier for a 11 month old and 2 year old to get through right now thanks to wic, my 9 year old, husband, and i could really use a pick me up as canned food and pb&j's gets old very fast (though my toddler would definitely enjoy this very much too).

we are near domino's, papa john's, and pizza hut. if anyone would like to make our night and help us out to a night of pizza, we would be so grateful and will happily pay it forward as soon as we are able. thank you for reading.

additional details: the reason why everything in the fridge is healthy and green is because my wife has been having some gastrointestinal issues for the past couple of years so we have been changing up diet to help her not feel sick after eating.  this week she just had a colonoscopy done (she's under 30) and the doctor noted some fluid that could be a symptom of a leaky gut or gastroparesis.  we won't know for sure until after she gets the test to check for it, but that's why everything we have in our apartment is green and healthy.

we currently made a wonderful zuppa toscana soup that will hopefully last us till this upcoming thursday (when she gets her next paycheck, which will hopefully not be docked by too much because of the overpay situation.) but we are kind of unsure. our fridge is laughably empty, and we are kind of just rationing what we have and utilizing what ingredients we have to stretch out until thursday. 

we could really use some help, but i recognize others are in a worse scenario. our situation will greatly improve by mid-march, but until then we are just playing it by ear and hoping my financial aid comes in sooner rather than later. in the spirit of reciprocity, i will give a few recipes in this post for others who have maybe $20 and need to stretch that out for the next week or so. we live near a pizza hut and any help would be awesome. we would love to pass on the act of kindness to someone else when our lives become a little more stabilized with my financial aid and her new job. 

the recipes i have are as follows, and are all quite delicious:

**1. zuppa toscana (tastes very similar to what olive garden serves):**

- small container of cream ($2)
- 1 bunch of kale ($1-2)
- 1/2-3/4 lb italian sausage ($2-3)
- yellow onion ($1)
- 4-6 cloves garlic, depending on how much you like garlic :) (.50 cents)
- 1/2 lb mushrooms ($2)
- 1/2 stick butter (50 cents- $1)
- 3 lbs potatoes ($2)
- chicken stock, or 1 bullion cube. ($2-3)
- 1 gallon water

cook sausage for 5 minutes in butter. add diced onions and diced mushrooms. cook for about 10 minutes. add chicken stock or bullion cube as well as water and bring to simmer. once simmering, add the potatoes. cook the soup for about 45 minutes. after that, add the cream and garlic. cook for another 20 minutes. add chopped kale at the end and cook for a remaining 10 minutes. season with salt and pepper as needed. some stocks are salty so i like to wait till near the end to adjust seasonings. 

all in all the dish costs about $17-$18 and should last a single person about 5-7 days. it's also quite delicious, easy, with minimal need for multiple pots (it's a one pot soup), and healthy. enjoy!

**2. french bread recipe (goes great with the toscana!):**

-4-6 cups flour. bread flour is best but regular flour works well also.  should be maybe $1 worth of flour.
- one packet yeast (50 cents - $1)
- two tablespoons sugar (negligible cost)
- 1 1/2 cup warm water (105 -115 degrees f)
- 2 tbsp any vegetable oil (25 cents at most)
- 1 tsp salt

combine yeast, sugar, and warm water in a bowl and whisk. let stand for 10 minutes until it is foamy. add in 2 cups flour, salt, and oil and mix together. continue to add flour until the dough stops sticking to your bowl. from here, you can either transfer the dough to a cutting board or, if the bowl is big enough, just knead more flour into the dough with your hands until it is just slightly sticky. set in a bowl in a warm place for about an hour. after that, you can separate half the dough away and reserve that for later. with the rest, you can either bake it in loaf or roll form. i find rolls to be easier if you have a deep baking dish. for rolls, just separate the dough out into 1-2 inch balls and place in a dish 1 inch apart. place in a warm place for about half an hour until that rises. preheat oven to 400 degrees f and bake the rolls for about 15-20 minutes and you are all done! the entire dish costs maybe $2 at the most.

hope these help anyone who is struggling to stretch $20 for a week. those 2 recipes can meet most of your food needs for less than a week or so. would highly recommend :)

my school made an error with my pell and awarded me too much.  i have been fighting them the entire semester to fix it. there solution to the problem is to take the diffrence out of my loans and keep it  and not report it to anyone includeing myself, they also desided to withhold the amount of my pell i wasn't suppose to get essentially stealing my finantal aid from me.  i only noticed because i checked up on them when i never got a dispersment. i just got out of my final culinary class only to find out that they took the remainder of my financial aid that was suppose to cover my summer classes and i will be booted from the classes tomarrow for non payment. i'm currently sitting in the student services department a bundle of nerves because they have spent the entire semester blowing me off and telling me things wpuld be worked out. i have no idea what i'm going to do now school wise or finantally. i'm already in the weeds and have a recently dead vehicle. if i don't take these classes i won't be able to move forward in my program untill next spring. a pizza would be a nice thing to look forward to tonight after such a devisasting day rather then another night of raman.

my depression and anxiety have been through the roof recently. so i've been going to my therapist more than often. several times we've looked into stabilization centers, but every time we do, no beds are available. 

i nearly lost my place of residence twice due to the person in living with being on the verge of kicking me out due to my mental illness increasing their own anxiety and depression. i've had to sleep at a friend's house once because i was too afraid (not for my safety, just anxiety offer facing the person i live with upon returning when i know they would rather have me out of their sight.) to go back to my own room where i've been living. i regret going to my friends house because my severe allergies to their cats caused me to have asthma attacks on and off for over a week after staying there. 

then i lost my ability to drive with uber to make money (only recently fixed this; it's the only job i've been able to do the last few months) because my insurance rolled over this month and they failed to update my online account or send me new insurance information. so uber suspended my ability to drive despite having insurance.

right after i lost my ability to drive for money. . . i found out that i lost my health insurance, which means that all my therapist appointments now have racked up a huge cost i had no idea about this whole past month. (still providing the proper paperwork to my state to fix this, as i'm on medicaid.)

i was so stressed out about both car and health insurance that i didn't even know that my snap benefits also went away. so after so much anxiety that i avoided shopping for weeks. . . after my therapist encouraged me to shop and i finally tried to. i got to the register and my snap card was declined. 

add in the fact that all this stress has caused me feel unable to work for uber. i have nearly gotten in 4 accidents this week trying to get all of this paperwork stuff sorted. severe anxiety can impair my ability to drive. i don't ever drive for uber unless my anxiety is okay enough for it, and i only drive to absolutely mandatory appointments like my therapist (an 8 minute ride from me on non-busy roads) when i do have high anxiety. the morning after i stayed over with my friend, i backed into a car in the parking lot and left a message with contact info. they haven't reached out and i don't know if that's good or bad.

between my anxiety and paperwork keeping me from making money all month, and my food money going away. . . i'm just sorta at my wits end. i've asked relatives for money to cover car/insurance payments and medical bills are looming; my last inhaler that i use to breathe is at 20 puffs left. (which is 10 effective doses)

i've not eaten anything but a single klondike bar in 2 days and for 2 weeks i've been going through what's left of the plain pasta/rice in my storage. if all goes well with my snap processing, i should have money in my account either tonight or sometime monday, but snap money where i live cannot be used on hot prepared foods so a luxury like pizza would be out of the question and has been for several months now, since i had to leave my job due to anxiety and panic attacks earlier this year. 

i want so badly to just be able to brush myself off and say, ""yeah, i'm fine!"" but i've been so bad lately that my best friend even came over uninvited (he has keys and permission to do so) one night just to be sure i wasn't dead. things have been a little better since he came and checked up on me. the paperwork that partially caused this emotional collapse is mostly taken care of, but it's left me with nothing to eat but a few stray klondike bars and heavy anxiety about calling relatives asking for more money yet again this month when i know that if i try to make enough money to pay them back next month it could cost me my snap and medicaid all over again.

there's a papa john's right around the corner from me. i am on the east coast; i'm happy to be more specific in a pm but i'd prefer to be less specific publically. i cannot express how much it would mean. it could take me a couple months to pay it forward since i have a lot of paying back to do first, but i definitely want to once i can.","[Request] Bad few weeks, hungry, a pizza would go a long way right now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/da25e4/request_bad_few_weeks_hungry_a_pizza_would_go_a/,2727.0,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,"['3DS', 'Breath_of_the_Wild', 'northernlion', 'funny', 'therewasanattempt', 'youtube', 'GoogleAllo', 'WTF', 'AskReddit', 'aww', 'NLSSCircleJerk', 'jobs', 'pokemon', 'forwardsfromgrandma', 'tipofmytongue', 'Calgary', 'MHOnline', 'videos', 'whatsbotheringyou', 'google', 'gaming', 'Edmonton', 'techsupport', 'bindingofisaac', 'Edmontongaming', 'Guildwars2', 'pokemongo', 'BeforeNAfterAdoption', 'AndroidTV', 'splatoon', 'NintendoNX', 'nintendo', 'HelpMeFind', 'Random_Acts_Of_Pizza', 'depression', 'Okami', 'monsterhunterclan', 'BDSMcommunity', 'SSBPM', 'savedyouaclick', 'NintendoSwitch', 'MonsterHunter', 'mealtimevideos', 'ACTrade', 'nonmonogamy', 'GW2Suggestions', 'Anxiety', 'smashbros']",Recipient (Got 1),Latromi,1569598663.0
