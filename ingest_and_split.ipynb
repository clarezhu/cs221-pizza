Any help with a couple of pizzas and I'll send you a free download link!\\n\\nEDIT: SallyMacLennane just made everyones night! Not only will I personally be paying this back, but the boys in the band have all subscribed and plan on doing their thing to help out in the future!\",\n",

She is visiting my aunt and uncle in Canada this week, so no food bill for me until Sunday. :(\\n\\nWhat I can give in return: If I give you my Papa John's credentials, you can order just a $10 pizza to my door and I will have earned 1 free large pizza from their loyalty program. :D\\nI can either eat it myself or send it back to you! 2 for the price of 1!\\nI can also chat with you about science, academics, or just politics or really whatever you'd like to talk about. We can connect on Tumblr or Facebook if you like :3\",\n",

My sister is my roommate; I'm basically crashing here, but have to be out next month, as she's apparently moving in with her boyfriend after that. No, I don't feel good about being a jobless layabout. I've been job hunting hard but nothing's been working out, and I can only really get around on foot.\\n\\nAnyway, so the only food I've had around here is potatoes. Which wouldn't be so bad, but there's really nothing to put on them (no butter for baked ones, no ketchup for fries, no oil or vinegar for cooking them with.) It's better than no food, but the combination of dry potatoes and tap water is crazy bland. The aforementioned sister spends most of her time with her boyfriend; my parents dropped off the bag of potatoes a couple of weeks ago. I don't wanna complain or anything, it's good to have a place to stay (for now) and sustenance,  but... a pizza, of any kind or any place, would be so so rad. Haven't pizza since July (my birthday.)\\n\\n I will of course pizza it forward immediately when I'm in a position to do so, this subreddit is such a wonderful thing and needs all the offerers it can get to keep it running.\\n\\nHope I'm doing this right!

No, I don't feel good about being a jobless layabout. I've been job hunting hard but nothing's been working out, and I can only really get around on foot.\\n\\nAnyway, so the only food I've had around here is potatoes. Which wouldn't be so bad, but there's really nothing to put on them (no butter for baked ones, no ketchup for fries, no oil or vinegar for cooking them with.) It's better than no food, but the combination of dry potatoes and tap water is crazy bland. The aforementioned sister spends most of her time with her boyfriend; my parents dropped off the bag of potatoes a couple of weeks ago. I don't wanna complain or anything, it's good to have a place to stay (for now) and sustenance,  but... a pizza, of any kind or any place, would be so so rad. Haven't pizza since July (my birthday.)\\n\\n I will of course pizza it forward immediately when I'm in a position to do so, this subreddit is such a wonderful thing and needs all the offerers it can get to keep it running.\\n\\nHope I'm doing this right! Thanks!\",\n",

This hasn\\'t happened, instead it\\'s brought us further to the bottom. We made a whole $500 last month and it\\'s not better this month either. He\\'s talking about getting a lawyer because, he hasn\\'t been paid for everything he\\'s done and paid way less than promised. No, we didn\\'t get anything in writing and that is one piece of evidence we don\\'t have for a lawyer.\\n\\nI applied for foodstamps on the 23rd of last month. They said they would be expedited but, then said (today on the phone) that since we did have that money last month then they have until after the 20th of this month to finish my case. They said they are unsure of the info on the wage form from his employer. Well, I haven\\'t seen it since they faxed it to eachother and my worker is out until Monday. I spoke to a supervisor and didn\\'t really get any words in.\\n\\nAnyways, our bills are not all paid so the $212 (Yes, that was his pay deposited in the bank!) today had to go towards the bills. My husband is a truck driver and I\\'m applying for financial aid to go back to college.\\n\\nWe are a family of 4 and would love to request pizza for tonight. Yes, I know that I am new. I cannot offer contribution of funds, gift cards or whatever but, I can offer things locally and posted an offer of a full garbage bag of clothing/shoes for a little girl in the assistance section. We are behind on our internet/phone so it will be shut off soon, that is why we still have internet access or else I\\'d have to use the library in town.\\n\\nI\\'m unsure of how this works, please bare with me. We are rural, they don\\'t deliver out here. There is a Pizza hut, Dominos and a Hunts brothers in a local country diner.\\n\\nI want to make sure everyone knows that my kids will NOT starve tonight if they don\\'t get pizza. We have a few odds and ends and I would never, ever let them starve. I\\'d find a way to get them food before letting that happen.

       "  'request_text_edit_aware': 'EDIT: I have been offered pizza for my family, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\\n\\nI\\'m really not sure how to do this, I\\'ve been lurking for awhile and signed up last night and my email is verified.\\n\\nMy husband started a new job at the beginning of last month, they pretty much promised the \"world\" to get him in the door. This hasn\\'t happened, instead it\\'s brought us further to the bottom. We made a whole $500 last month and it\\'s not better this month either. He\\'s talking about getting a lawyer because, he hasn\\'t been paid for everything he\\'s done and paid way less than promised. No, we didn\\'t get anything in writing and that is one piece of evidence we don\\'t have for a lawyer.\\n\\nI applied for foodstamps on the 23rd of last month. They said they would be expedited but, then said (today on the phone) that since we did have that money last month then they have until after the 20th of this month to finish my case. They said they are unsure of the info on the wage form from his employer. Well, I haven\\'t seen it since they faxed it to eachother and my worker is out until Monday. I spoke to a supervisor and didn\\'t really get any words in.\\n\\nAnyways, our bills are not all paid so the $212 (Yes, that was his pay deposited in the bank!) today had to go towards the bills. My husband is a truck driver and I\\'m applying for financial aid to go back to college.\\n\\nWe are a family of 4 and would love to request pizza for tonight. Yes, I know that I am new. I cannot offer contribution of funds, gift cards or whatever but, I can offer things locally and posted an offer of a full garbage bag of clothing/shoes for a little girl in the assistance section. We are behind on our internet/phone so it will be shut off soon, that is why we still have internet access or else I\\'d have to use the library in town.\\n\\nI\\'m unsure of how this works, please bare with me. We are rural, they don\\'t deliver out here. There is a Pizza hut, Dominos and a Hunts brothers in a local country diner.\\n\\nI want to make sure everyone knows that my kids will NOT starve tonight if they don\\'t get pizza. We have a few odds and ends and I would never, ever let them starve. I\\'d find a way to get them food before letting that happen. I\\'ll also be visiting the pantry for the 1st time on Tuesday.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure what kind of proof I could give? His checks are direct deposited with no stubs mailed yet. Let me know what I need, I can try to figure out something to prove if requred.',\n",

Thanks flamingcow!\\n\\nFirst off - I will **not** *starve* between now and Friday, so if you\\'d rather help someone who has absolutely nothing, I understand, appreciate your stance, and thank you for helping someone truly in need.  \\n\\nI\\'ve been unemployed for better than two years. During that time, I watched most of my photography clients (I did a lot of corporate work) shut down their budgets for expenditures like me. As that income dwindled, I began looking for other work. I\\'m not sure how much the year-long gap of \"employment\" (other than self-employed) has mattered, but I haven\\'t been able to find anything. About a week and a half ago I finally got to the point I had to take a laborer job that\\'s physically killing me (ok, it\\'s only very painful). So I\\'ll have something coming my way soon.  \\n\\nIn the mean time, I have a 1/2 sack of potatoes, a few cans of corn, 1/2 jar of peanut butter, 3/4 loaf of bread, and a few boxes of mac and cheese. All of which is pretty much what I\\'ve been eating for the past couple of weeks. Like I said, I won\\'t starve, but I damn sure don\\'t have a meal I\\'m actually looking forward to for the next week.  \\n\\nIt\\'s just me. My dog passed the day after Easter, and as much as I\\'d love another pet, I know I\\'m not in a position financially to take on another right now. So even a medium pizza would be like 4 meals - I could take a couple of slices to work every other day for lunch or something just to break the monotony of what I\\'ve been having.  \\n\\nI\\'m not hiding behind a new account - I am who I am. A quick look at my profile will tell you exactly who I am, and hopefully give you a sense that I try to contribute to the community as well when I can (/r/TOMT, /r/picrequest, gift exchanges, postcards to kids/random people/etc., general blathering). You\\'ll also see where I\\'ve sold some of my camera gear to a fellow redditor because I needed the money. I feel bad asking when it\\'s not a matter of \"need it or I\\'ll die\", but I figure if I\\'m just honest about where I am, someone might throw me a ~~bone~~ pizza in the spirit of the *Random Acts* part of the subreddit.  \\n\\nEither way, if you\\'re still reading, you\\'re a good person for even considering helping someone out. Thanks for being part of what makes reddit awesome.',\n",

I\\'ve been surviving off the kindness of my landlord/roommates, (I do dishes I don\\'t have to pay for food) but that can only go so far. I\\'m attempting to go back to school so I don\\'t have to pay my student loans back, especially since the call volume is dropping at the center and I haven\\'t been getting the best hours. \\nAccording to the government I make too much money to qualify for food stamps, and my dad makes too much money for me to qualify for Pell Grant. My car has been spazzing out and I think it\\'s probably on it\\'s last legs, and today I didn\\'t even make conversion at work for the month, so I don\\'t get any bonuses.\\nOverall everything\\'s just been a bit rough, I definitely plan on paying it forward as soon as I get everything together. One of my landlords wants me to dogsit for a couple weeks or so next month, and I\\'ll be able to cover everything then.\\nIt\\'s just been a really rough day and I could use a meal that I didn\\'t have to cook myself today.',\n",

This last week I've had to pay back some small debts to my boss and father, and it's really hurt.\\n\\nAlso, our stove at this apartment doesn't work, so we've had to basically resort to microwave, cold prep foods, and a single burner hotplate.

My family is hungry, but just for the day.\\n\\nSo here is my request, which I will counter with an offer. In exchange for a pizza, I will buy 2 other people in need a pizza in the near future. This is my way of setting aside the guilt of asking, and expanding the assistance of RAOP. I can provide any and all proof and verification needed. And whatever happens, I'd still like to thank RAOP for all their awesomeness.\\n\\nNOTE: Come Monday, I can get my paycheck advanced to me. Yesterday we just barely slid by, and all will be well from Moday on. I've got a second job that I start Tuesday at. It's just rather...depressing(maybe even desperate) feeling to be hungry, have an empty wallet, and feel like there is nothing I can do.

       "  'request_text': \"Hi Everyone!\\n\\nFirst time requester here and thanks for reading. I'd like to request a pizza for my partner of 7 years. I think it'd be a really nice surprise for him and he loves Reddit as much as I do, so it'd give him one heck of a smile. If you're interested, I want to provide some history so you know where I'm coming from and why I'd like to see that smile. I'll try to provide enough context without being too verbose :)\\n\\nAbout 3 years ago I lost my job in marketing. I was the breadwinner in the relationship and he worked for fun, really. I set out to find another job at the start of the recession and it didn't go so well.\\n\\nAfter about a year of being unemployed, living off savings and looking for another job that would pay enough for me to pay my bills (a big concern that stopped me from taking a lot of jobs due to pay requirements... we all have to service our debt obligations!)  I realized I hated what I was doing. I was 25 then... 2 years ago. \\n\\nIt's strange and hard to describe, I think, unless you've gone through something similar. I worked hard, ever since I was 13 and had a paper route that earned me a couple hundred a month. When I was 16 I got a job at Best Buy and that's when my 'career' in sales took off. I sold on the Best Buy floor for about a year, then went to CompUSA where I worked as a commissioned sales guy. My first commission job and I was only 17. I made really good money and continued to progress through retail and then into retail marketing. \\n\\nBy the time I was entering college I was making more than most people who had been out of college for years, and that number went up every year. That kind of money blinded me to the fact that I wasn't enjoying what I was doing... I was enjoying making and spending money. So much so that I burned through it faster than I made it. It was really the only thing I had fun doing, though. I dropped out of college (probably a good thing, since I was going for a degree I wouldn't want now).\\n\\nI met my partner through Myspace at about the time I had gotten my first management position and was traveling 90% of the time. The first couple years were great. I was gone so much it was like a long honeymoon. Sometimes he'd come with me; Vegas, NYC, Seattle... etc. \\n\\nFor his part he worked off and on. It was never a big deal... I made a lot more money than him. He'd always worked odd retail jobs, hourly stuff, customer service stuff. Never made over $10 an hour or held a job for more than half a year. I didn't care because I'd rather spend my time with him when I was home than have him working and making a couple extra bucks.\\n\\nSo, back to three years ago when I lost my job. After about a year of coming up dry, I fell into a pretty bad depression. I couldn't find work that would pay my bills, and realized that I didn't even like doing that work. It affected our relationship dramatically. I retreated into World of Warcraft and stopped talking to family. Eventually the money ran out and bills stopped getting paid. \\n\\nI hit bottom after a long, dark period... but thankfully for me bottom was a nice soft pillow of people that loved me. My parents stepped in to help get me through some tough financials and my partner stepped up to support me mentally and financially. \\n\\nFast forward to today. My partner is now happily employed (1 year anniversary this month) with a company that is providing him with a promising career opportunity that he loves doing. We've downsized our lives; no car, eating cheap, staying in, cooking and we've moved into a studio apartment. My partner is working we're saving so I can go to school and do something that I do love; be a vet. He even got me a chocolate Labrador puppy in February. We named him Fizban and he's a constant source of joy for me. The person I was 3 years ago would not recognize the person I am today.\\n\\nI try to do nice things for him whenever possible to lessen the stress of being the sole earner in the house. That's what this request is about. We're not starving, but we live tight. This would not only be a delicious treat for us, but once my partner found out that it came from a generous person on Reddit he will be amazed.\\n\\nOne day I promise to pay it forward. Here's a picture of my dog, Fizban and my partner:  http://imgur.com/SoygY\",\n",

I'll try to provide enough context without being too verbose :)\\n\\nAbout 3 years ago I lost my job in marketing. I was the breadwinner in the relationship and he worked for fun, really. I set out to find another job at the start of the recession and it didn't go so well.\\n\\nAfter about a year of being unemployed, living off savings and looking for another job that would pay enough for me to pay my bills (a big concern that stopped me from taking a lot of jobs due to pay requirements... we all have to service our debt obligations!)  I realized I hated what I was doing. I was 25 then... 2 years ago. \\n\\nIt's strange and hard to describe, I think, unless you've gone through something similar. I worked hard, ever since I was 13 and had a paper route that earned me a couple hundred a month. When I was 16 I got a job at Best Buy and that's when my 'career' in sales took off. I sold on the Best Buy floor for about a year, then went to CompUSA where I worked as a commissioned sales guy. My first commission job and I was only 17. I made really good money and continued to progress through retail and then into retail marketing. \\n\\nBy the time I was entering college I was making more than most people who had been out of college for years, and that number went up every year. That kind of money blinded me to the fact that I wasn't enjoying what I was doing... I was enjoying making and spending money. So much so that I burned through it faster than I made it. It was really the only thing I had fun doing, though. I dropped out of college (probably a good thing, since I was going for a degree I wouldn't want now).\\n\\nI met my partner through Myspace at about the time I had gotten my first management position and was traveling 90% of the time. The first couple years were great. I was gone so much it was like a long honeymoon. Sometimes he'd come with me; Vegas, NYC, Seattle... etc. \\n\\nFor his part he worked off and on. It was never a big deal... I made a lot more money than him. He'd always worked odd retail jobs, hourly stuff, customer service stuff. Never made over $10 an hour or held a job for more than half a year. I didn't care because I'd rather spend my time with him when I was home than have him working and making a couple extra bucks.\\n\\nSo, back to three years ago when I lost my job. After about a year of coming up dry, I fell into a pretty bad depression. I couldn't find work that would pay my bills, and realized that I didn't even like doing that work. It affected our relationship dramatically. I retreated into World of Warcraft and stopped talking to family. Eventually the money ran out and bills stopped getting paid. \\n\\nI hit bottom after a long, dark period... but thankfully for me bottom was a nice soft pillow of people that loved me. My parents stepped in to help get me through some tough financials and my partner stepped up to support me mentally and financially. \\n\\nFast forward to today. My partner is now happily employed (1 year anniversary this month) with a company that is providing him with a promising career opportunity that he loves doing. We've downsized our lives; no car, eating cheap, staying in, cooking and we've moved into a studio apartment. My partner is working we're saving so I can go to school and do something that I do love; be a vet. He even got me a chocolate Labrador puppy in February. We named him Fizban and he's a constant source of joy for me. The person I was 3 years ago would not recognize the person I am today.\\n\\nI try to do nice things for him whenever possible to lessen the stress of being the sole earner in the house. That's what this request is about. We're not starving, but we live tight. This would not only be a delicious treat for us, but once my partner found out that it came from a generous person on Reddit he will be amazed.\\n\\nOne day I promise to pay it forward. Here's a picture of my dog, Fizban and my partner:  http://imgur.com/SoygY\",\n",

Came out with a new lease on life, and spent the next 3 - 4 months in a sober living facility. Just trying to remember how to live and enjoy life sober.. I got the best job i have ever had (Contracting for charter) and after a month i was promoted to be the south Saint Louis Market contractor. (Basically i managed all southern saint Louis contractors)\\nThings were going great, With my new job i rented out a new apartment Set myself up a home office, and genuinely enjoyed day to day activities. Then one day, When i was heading back from a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, I got pulled over in Illinois (15 minutes from my apartment in Saint Louis) The Police Officer Informed me that i had an outstanding warrant in O-Fallon Missouri for Possession of a controlled substance. You see, I knew that this warrant was a possibility, But i had assumed they would let me know when they decided to issue the warrant! 6 months prior (Before Rehab) i had been arrested for Possesion and they had let me go, With no ticket, Not even a court date. Since that was my first serious charge ever i had assumed they would at least let me know if i had a warrant.\\nWell. Long story short(er) I ended up spending 5 days in a holding cell in collinsville Illinois, 2 Days in Madison County, and 1 day in St Charles County. MY mother had got me a lawyer so that i could bond out (they didn't want to let me post 10% so without a lawyer my bond would have been 20,000) and ended up spending 5k just so i can hopefully keep my job.\\n\\nShe had hoped that by getting a lawyer and since this was my first offence, ever, We would be able to preserve my job. Well, No luck. I lost my job because of my 1 week absence and the fact that i had obtained a felony. Since i was a contractor i cannot collect unemployment.\\n\\nSo here i am. 1 month later. With barely Any food in my fridge, A carton of cigarettes, and an internet connection that will be shut off any day now.

Well my piece of shit extended warranty doesn't cover any of the things wrong with it and it's going to cost me 2500 like i have that lying around. So if there's any kinda strangers who can help a sista out with a pizza that would be great. I want pizza is kinda code when I'm just super sad. Since I have Celiac Disease and eating pizza is a treat for me now even though there's more options for us people who can't have gluten. Anywho, if there's any kind soul who can afford a pizza that'd be cool. but even a joke or uplifting advice would be cool too. Thanks. And I hope one day I can return the favour.

He's been paying our electric and water since we moved into the apartment! She goes over to his house almost daily when she left me to head to work.

I thank the dozens of folks who offered encouragement in thread and through PM as well as the others who flamed and trolled me so diligently. Ripping into you was an awesome way to blow off some steam, so you helped out a lot too. Thanks again to everyone, here's to a brighter future.\",\n",

We are trying to save to repair the roof and replace the drywall that was damaged. Since that time, things have continued to spiral downward. I don't want to be long winded, but it has gone so far that we have had to apply for foodstamps and medicaid because I have 2 have surgery and a diagnostic procedure to rule out cervical cancer. My husband's wages have been cut because the runs just aren't there. We are struggling and the only way that we have had any food for the past couple of weeks is because of my parents. I have been looking for a job, but I have had no success. We are even having to sell our electronics on craigslist to try and get some money to survive.

I do not have any money since I am going to surprise my mother with the money for her to use whatever little money I have given her for the surgery.

(Plus, I can surprise the fianceé with her half to lessen the blow.  She knows, incidentally.)\\n\\nSorry to bother.\\n\\n**Edit** ... Sorry again. I\\'m in Ontario, Canada. I\\'m new to this. Sorry.\\n\\n**UPDATE**  I didn\\'t get pizza last night. User \"shockey\" helped out (I believe, because my faith in humanity can\\'t let me think that this was a prank) to the point of taking my personal info, but no pizza came.  Around 11pm last night, I noticed that they deleted their user info from Reddit, but tried to ignore the warning flags that come with that.\\n\\n[Conversation, part 1](http://imgur.com/QkDp5.jpg) and [part 2.](http://imgur.com/ktmYJ.jpg)\\n\\nSorry, everyone, for getting your hopes up. I don\\'t know what my fianceé ate last night. It\\'s nearly 5am for me now, so I\\'ll go eat some cereal and make a coffee, and start the day. ~~I\\'ll message the mods here about this~~ (Nope, I have no info and it was only my trust), but only time will tell if we were scammed or not. I hope not.  I sincerely think that it was a first-time gesture that didn\\'t go through.\\n\\nI really don\\'t mean to bother anyone, and thanks for the words and support you gave. \\n\\n**UPDATE 2** Hello, again. Thanks to everyone who messaged their support and well-wishes.\\n\\nAlthough we never received pizza from *Random Acts of Pizza*, which has an obstacle regarding cross-border exchanges it seems, it should be noted that *we did have pizza* last night from some old friends of ours who invited us back to our hometown.  It was a great night out and all of us got some great laughs and good social vibes.\\n\\n*(The first* \"boy pizza\" *had pepperoni, bacon, tomato, and red pepper; the second* \"girl pizza\" *was feta cheese, sundried tomato, red onion, and green olives.  There was also 20 deep-fried wings, ordered with BBQ sauce but supplemented with the home\\'s own Frank Sauce. A jug of Nestle Ice Tea Zero was offered and shared all around.)*\\n\\nI just want to thank everyone who has offered to assist my fianceé and I in the last few days. She\\'s as astounded and overjoyed at this post as I am, and we thank you all sincerely.  She also keeps nudging me to start accepting some of the gratuity, Since I was fence-sitting because of my morality, ethics, and humility, I\\'ve decided to graciously accept a few offers (if still available) via private message. If declined, I fully understand with no ill will.\\n\\nOnce again, thank you, everyone.  You are an awesome community, and we love you.\\n\\n**TL;DR** Laid off, pizza offer fell through in possible scam (though hopefully not), Reddit comes through with offers and consolation, we get pizza from friends back home.\\n\\n[Here\\'s a pic...](http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/images/bunny.jpg)\\n\\n[...from the cutest images ever. Thank you.](http://thecutest.info/top.html)\\n\\n**UPDATE 3** Five months later, and I got a low-wage job doing satellite installation. It\\'s something. Thanks for your kindnesses, reddit.',\n",

It's a mixture of embarrassing, frustrating, and sad. I don't want to move back home but I don't know what to do.

(North County)~~\\n\\n~~We have a three bedroom house that the bank is trying to foreclose on. Although this isn't a new situation for us, the guy who offered to do the home loan modification took two-thousand dollars of my and my mother's money and bailed. My mom's transmission also failed around last month so we've been taking the bus.~~\\n\\n~~We have been able to manage lately, until recently when my sister and her husband declared they would not be paying my mom rent for staying here anymore, and I found out they had only been paying my mom seventy-five dollars each for the past four months.

I had faith that between my family and all my friends..  SomeONE.. (I thought there would be many)  would find it in their heart to take me in, even if for just a short time..  After waiting a few days, I realized that no one was going to come to my aid.. So I decided to start asking those who I KNEW would do anything for me.. Or so I thought.. Immediate family turned me away without even a 2nd thought.. Since they were the only ones in my family that had room for me, I had to move on to my good friends.. My best friend lives 4 hours away so that just wasn\\'t an option.. My other best friend AND neighbor would definitely take me in.. I just knew she would!!  She has an empty guest bedroom and everything.. So I asked if she could help me out and let me stay in the guest room for no longer than a month.. Without even pretending to think about it.. She said \"I don\\'t have any room for you\".. That was it.. I had exhausted all my options.. One day before my eviction I started to plan the best way to be homeless.. I decided to live in my van.... Scary doesn\\'t come close to how I felt, but my fear was deep.... Ring Ring! It\\'s Curtis.. A friend I met thru my best friend.. I knew him and considered him a friend but we didn\\'t know each other very well.. Without hesitation he said that he heard about my situation and wanted to offer me a place on his couch..  I burst into tears.. I was relieved.. But mostly, I was so touched to receive such extreme generosity from someone who is also struggling just as hard as I am!  So here we are at his 1 bedroom apartment.. Trying to figure out how we are going to afford something to eat TONIGHT.. Let alone tomorrow.. But It\\'s 6:52pm and neither of us have eaten today.. I want Curtis to have this pizza cause he deserves it!  Thanks for reading! :)',\n",

Basically I'm waiting for school to start so I can receive my financial aid in order to purchase books and more importantly FOOD. Unfortunately that isn't for another 2 weeks....which has kind of left me in a desperate situation. Hence the RAOP request. For those wary gifters out there I know...this is a new account and thus this request will probably be treated as a scam but I assure you that I am indeed a real live hungry college student. Starving, some might say, stupid as well for hoping $150 could buy me a months worth of food, but alas, a man can dream. Anyways, a pizza or a gift card would really go a long way; a gift card more so because I would stave off hunger as long as possible, but any food right now would be fantastic and I would really appreciate the help.

My grandfather has been in the hospital for a week and my mom just went in this morning because she has pneumonia. My dad, who is still in the middle of work, just drove my sister to her soccer game and is going to visit my grandpa, then to visit my mom in a different hospital, then going back to work. He came home for a half hour and he said I can't leave the house because I have SATs tomorrow morning and no one can come over because no one is home. When he left he told me we have nothing to eat and to buy my own food tonight and he'll pay me back. I just checked my wallet and I remembered I just spend my only $20 to buy a prepaid card to buy a game on Steam last night and I'm kind of regretting that now. Now I'm stuck here alone for two hours until my sister gets a ride home from her soccer game and who knows when my dad will be home. No matter what time he gets home, I still wont be able to eat. So all I'm asking for is a small pizza for one so I can eat tonight.\\n\\nTL;DR: Grandpa and my mom are in the hospital.

I am a 22yo veteran of the Army Reserve who is currently being medically discharged for Bipolar Affective Disorder type 2(severe depression, dysphoric hypomania). I have tried to work but I have chest pains and anxiety attacks from ptsd. I try my hardest to hold out but i cant work if Im curled up in the bathroom praying for death. Im just trying to explain why Im so broke. I cant get any VA benefits until my claim is processed(months from now) so I have to pay for my meds out of pocket. I make 20$ a week taking an experimental sleep medication in a clinical trial but most of that goes to bus fare, meds(Ive got a few rx's), and stretching out food. I applied for food stamps but my card was delayed(stolen out of mailbox) and now I wont see it until a couple weeks. Im living with my roommate who has been kind enough to only ask me for 50 a month in rent, but that leaves little room for pizza! I honestly havent had a pizza this year. Its one of the few things that makes me feel better, like theres something to live for and look forward to again. maybe Im not the most deserving, but it would really help me out.
