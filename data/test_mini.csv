It dawned on me that I had all the stuff for vegan fudge, I'm not vegan, or vegetarian, but I am pretty clever. Here's what I had for dinner. 
     3 cups sugar
     1 1/2 cups water (use coconut, almond, or regular milk if you've got it)
     2/3 cups of coco
What you wanna do is boil the shit out of these 3 ingredients until they pass the ""hard ball"" test... What's that you ask? you just drizzle a little bit of the mixture into a bowl of cold water and if you can reach in and form a ball your mixture passed (Test frequently until you have the hang of making fudge)... Once your fudge passes the test turn off the heat and toss in a TSP of Vanilla and a Half a stick of butter if you've got it (I made mine with just sugar water and cocoa last night and it was still good). At this point you can toss stuff in your chocolate goo... Nuts, Raisins, those little cranberry raisin thingies... Ya know whatever, I like to dump a load of peanut butter in there when I have it. Super easy!
