Thank you.  Hopefully someday soon I'll be the one sending out the pizza.","Hey RAoP,

My situation is that I just finished a term in AmeriCorps (http://www.reddit.com/r/americorps) now I'm looking for work and picked up a class to teach at a college, but it doesn't even cover my rent so I'm still looking for a full-time job.

I ran out of food this month because I was sharing my food stamps with another AmeriCorps to tide him over (he's a wiry guy that ate like a horse, and I'm just a wee 120 lb gal that doesn't need that much, so it made sense at the time).  I'm down to 5 packets of ramen, but new funds come in on the 5th so I really just would like to get through this weekend and also feel a bit less depressed while job hunting and lesson planning.  If you could please send me a pizza, it would make my night!

Thank you.  Hopefully someday soon I'll be the one sending out the pizza.","[REQUEST] San Jose, California - AmeriCorps alumni and severely underemployed teacher out of food and would be ecstatic if there was some pizza in her life right now",0.0,460.29072916666667,0.0,460.29072916666667,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,False,[],0,4,0,20,,hungrycorpsteacher,1346548629.0,1346545029.0

N/A,False,2,3,False,0,"So, a friend got screwed out of a place tonight (landord dick-ness), and as such is stuck using what little money she has left paying for a hotel in Southwest Florida. If you kind pizza-ers can give her a hand that'd be swell. I know it's not me, but she's never used Reddit, and College has also left me quite poor. You have my word that I will pay it forward. Thanks regardless!","So, a friend got screwed out of a place tonight (landord dick-ness), and as such is stuck using what little money she has left paying for a hotel in Southwest Florida.

ghotisgirl06,False,4,18,False,13,"I'm on my own and have no family to speak of, I'm alone in Florida and have $5.48 left to my name for gas to get to and from work. I lost my job due to downsizing but thankfully got a new one soon after - the only problem is they pay you bi weekly. I started on the 9th of this month and don't get my paycheck until this Thursday - the 26th. I only have enough bread left to have one sandwich a day until then. I want nothing more right now than a Domino's Philly Cheese Steak pizza and a 20oz bottle of cherry coke and I swear to celebrate my first paycheck by giving someone else a pizza as soon as I can. Please help me before I start to cry strawberry jelly.","I'm on my own and have no family to speak of, I'm alone in Florida and have $5.48 left to my name for gas to get to and from work.
