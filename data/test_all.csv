Now I could stretch what I have l easily for 2ish days, but that still leaves me short tonight and tomorrow. I normally am not the kind of person to ask for a handout but if anyone could help me during this perfect shitstorm that would be make my week. The second I have access to my accounts and money again I plan on passing it along. 

TL;DR: I got fucked by my ex-roomate. To ""protect"" me schwab locked all my accounts while telling me I would still be able to use them. So i've got no money till monday and am just short of food to make it till then.

But today I lost my best friend. 

My friend since fourth grade was bullied out of school in 6th, and nobody talked to him. I felt bad for him, and I stuck with him. Several years go by, and I'm still his only friend, so I convince him to come to my school, and meet my friends! So school starts, and he meets my friends, he doesn't really click with them, and decides to meet new people. A month go by, and he meets some really bad kids. Stupid kids no one else likes. Any way, I try and talk to him today, and he gives me a cold shoulder. 

When I tell him what he did wasn't cool (being an awkward homeschooler he doesn't know much about being with people), he apologizes. The bell rings, we go to class. After class him and his buddy come up to me, punch me, and run off. 

This puts me in a bad mood. I storm home. He texts ""What's wrong?"" I tell him ""You, punching me."" He then, goes on about how I'm over reacting, because I'm upset, he punched me, and I tell him to go away, not wanting to talk, and he just refuses to believe he did anything wrong.  He then argues, that ""I should just suck it up, it's your fault you're in pain, if you weren't so weak, it wouldn't have hurt!""

I then at that very moment, lose it, sh*t hits the fan. I tell him ""Screw off. We're not friends. I don't wanna be associated with a person who believe they're not ever at fault."" I haven't talk to him since. This was a few hours ago. So I'm just lost. He's one of the few people I had left.

My parents are in the process of moving into their new home after being homeless for about a month. There have been a lot of really frustrating and stressful developments over the past nine months leading to my parents moving into this new home. I've taken most of this week off of work to come and help with this transition.

Unfortunately, after I arrived I learned that they have delayed the actual move-in days because the previous owner was a ""crazy cat lady"" and the house still reeks of urine. (There are visible signs of spraying in some of the rooms.)

I have learned that over the weekend my mother spent most of her time shampooing, and re-shampooing all of the rooms. Today my father and I spent most of the day addressing  and then moving in the heavy furniture and furnishings. Hopefully if all went well with the previous cleanings, we'll be able to start moving the majority of items into the home. (Unless it is decided that the carpeting will need to be replaced first.)

Anyway, long story short, it would be fantastic if we could have pizza for dinner tomorrow (Tuesday) night. I'm not financially able to supply any food while I'm staying here, and I was hoping that maybe someone would be willing to help us out.

We'll pay it back when I can catch up in a few weeks.

I work in a call center in a little cubicle where my only joy is seeing the clock hit 7pm. I sit in a chair and get yelled at for 8 hours. Sometimes 16 hours, because my boss likes to tell me that his star agent has taken off and he needs me to cover their shift. This rockstar agent also likes to come in late and is related to the head manager so..why would I complain about him? Who would I complain to? He's a pain in my ass always asking me questions that he should know the answer to. 

My other co-workers are really good people and by good I mean aholes. One guy plays erotic games most of his shift on the company computer and no one seems to care. Another lady is a busy body Christian looking to convert everyone and anyone she can find. If she spent more time working versus running around telling everyone to have a blessed day, she'd get more accomplished. The other co-workers pretty much annoy the living shit out of me. They call me and ask for answers or blind transfer callers to me. 

I know I need out of this job and I complain way more than I should. I should be happy I have a job. I should be happy I can barely afford my bills. Right right? Wrong! I've been looking everywhere else for work, but not many places are hiring near me. I'm so depressed with everything. My only motivation to go into work is for the check.

Understandably, she's very freaked out and upset at being down there by herself and having to face the possibility of neurosurgery this week alone.  I'd like to try and cheer her up, but we spent all my ""able to spend this"" money just to help GET her down there ($500 just from me, and more from her husband and my girlfriend to cover it all).  Given that stress doesn't help her condition, it bothers me that she's under such pressure alone and I can't help any more than this.

That's why I'm asking you guys.  Can we get her a pizza from a stranger to help restore some of her feeling that things will be okay?",[REQUEST] For a sick and stressed-out friend.,1.930810185185185,832.2328125,0.0,830.2603356481482,1,25,0,0,0,14,0,1,1,False,['AskReddit'],1,154,1,258,,manyhattedman,1314583288.0,1314579688.0

I have linked some pictures below, so that you see what you have to work with. The walls are an off white/egg color (bleh). Have you ever gone to someone's house and thought ""Wow, why did they pick this stupid color?"" I am regretting my decision of selecting this color. Just placing one finger on the wall and that one spot is now 10x darker than the rest of the wall. Maybe I just have dirty fingers? :D

I hope I can satisfy someones curiosity or desire in just wanting to have some control or a say over someone else's living space. I'm not a good designer by any means. I still think a milk crate and a towel make a perfect chair. No wonder I'm single. 

Anyway, I want to thank you for reading my very long post. I hope you enjoy your Saturday and won't spend the day watching paint dry. Please pick a good color. Any color other than white/egg shell. Please and thank you :)

Have you ever gone to someone's house and thought ""Wow, why did they pick this stupid color?"" I am regretting my decision of selecting this color. Just placing one finger on the wall and that one spot is now 10x darker than the rest of the wall. Maybe I just have dirty fingers? :D

I hope I can satisfy someones curiosity or desire in just wanting to have some control or a say over someone else's living space. I'm not a good designer by any means. I still think a milk crate and a towel make a perfect chair. No wonder I'm single. 

Anyway, I want to thank you for reading my very long post. I hope you enjoy your Saturday and won't spend the day watching paint dry. Please pick a good color. Any color other than white/egg shell. Please and thank you :)

So backstory. Last year (I was 18), I was sexually assaulted by a stranger not too far from Harvard Square. It resulted in some severe PTSD: I couldn't sleep or eat. I was hardly able to function or focus enough to even engage in casual conversation. I couldn't stand to exist in my own mind any longer so I tried to fix it by drinking, which only made me feel sick and more depressed. I tried smoking weed (I'd smoked often before and it seemed to help then) but now the weed gave me flashbacks to the assault and made it so much worse. I was getting desperate. I don't know how the idea got into my head, but one morning I was getting dressed and I just made the decision. It was this voice of deliberate recklessness that announced, ""Today I'm going to try heroin.""

It was alarmingly easy to get my hands on it. It was cheap and it was everything I needed. I knew it was stupid, but I didn't care. I had nothing left to lose - and why stop when it works?

Well eventually I ended up in a psych hospital for the PTSD and heroin addiction. I got help, I got my shit together, and I'm going to college.

It is amazing to see people helping each other this way.  There was a point when getting a pizza meant nothing.  It was more of an escape from cooking for the night then a special treat.  Those days are long gone.  In the last year I've gone through a divorce and lost my job.  I do get unemployment, but I'm $500 in the negative every month with just the standard bills, not counting gas or food.  It's a round robin of who gets payed each month based on the impending shut-off notice.  TV service is long gone, and we wouldn't have the internet if not for it being a major part of the job hunt.  We've learned to live on what we have, and I'm grateful to say my kids are too young to fully appreciate where are at four and five.

I am deeply touched reading all of these posts.  Both from those in need, and those looking to help.  It is amazing to see people helping each other this way.  There was a point when getting a pizza meant nothing.  It was more of an escape from cooking for the night then a special treat.  Those days are long gone.  In the last year I've gone through a divorce and lost my job.  I do get unemployment, but I'm $500 in the negative every month with just the standard bills, not counting gas or food.  It's a round robin of who gets payed each month based on the impending shut-off notice.  TV service is long gone, and we wouldn't have the internet if not for it being a major part of the job hunt.  We've learned to live on what we have, and I'm grateful to say my kids are too young to fully appreciate where are at four and five.

He always does a great job managing bills, including our puppy, gas, etc. We try to buy enough groceries to last us the two weeks before pay-day and in between he gives plasma for extra cash.

This week he received a vacation for all of the days he's gone in early or when it was his day off and we've been waiting for Thursday (he gives plasma Thurs/Sat) for a night to finally have money for some good food.

On his way home from the Biolife center a few minutes ago he called me and said he was stuck at a gas station because he tried using the Biolife card to get gas. The pump automatically charges a card $75 dollars, I believe, and then puts back whatever you didn't use. My husband pulled the pump out to use it, realized the car was too far back, and put the pump back to pull the car forward. Somehow by doing that something got cancelled and the money is being withheld. When he called the card company they said it could be up to 7 days before it goes back into the account. My husband had to call his boss and ask if he could use the business card for $3 in gas to get home that he'd pay back Monday.

It would be so amazing if someone would provide us that awesome Thursday night we had planned. The favor *will* be returned by Saturday when he gives plasma again!

The shop's bill came to $320 and some change, to replace the rusted pipes/cat and weld up the connections.  
  
Let me say that I'm not in a dire situation, my parents were able to lend me enough to cover my overdraft fee and most of my rent, but I've nothing left for food. I have enough frozen burritos to survive, but a warm pizza would be amazing.

I go into work after class, and go to look at my schedule for the next week. I'm scheduled for 12 hours. I go to ask one of my managers what's up because I literally can't even pay for my gas to drive to work on those hours. Apparently someone decided to start a rumor about me at work that I was tired of working there and that I was bad-mouthing the managers. Instead of coming to talk to me, they listened to the rumors and cut my hours. Wednesday comes around. I'm on my to school when my car starts acting funny. I'm on my way to class, and am almost at the school, so I just try and get the school where I can look at my car. I'm in the parking lot getting ready to pull into a spot when my car dies. Steam starts coming out from under the hood, I knew it had overheated. My temp gauge didn't show it was overheating so it told me that my thermometer was broken. I call my dad and tell him I'm stuck at the school, he says when he gets a chance he'll bring a thermometer up to me and we'd replace it at the school. I wait 20 minutes, start the car up again,  pull into the closest spot, and go to class. I come out from class and look under the hood. Radiator is empty and the resevoir tank is massively overfilled, leading to the thermometer again. I put water in my radiator, and try to start my car; nothing. I try again, hear a loud bang, get a big puff of smoke, and my car dies. I just cracked the engine block, meaning my car is dead. As a side note, my school and work is 40 minutes away one from where I live. I cannot live without having a car. So now I'm having to borrow my dad's car. Next comes Thursday. My parents are going through a very bad divorce, and my dad was having to travel to a different state for the trial. I get a call from him late in the afternoon, in which he's very upset with me. The day before I told my mom about my car, and told her I was using my dad's car, and then she asked how my dad was going to the trial. This was where I made my mistake: I told her that he was using his company credit card. Apparently she used this information in court against him, and it wasn't something even his lawyer knew about. Now my dad is upset with me because he thinks he can't say anything to me because I'll just go to my mom. I'm not talking to my mom right now because she took something I told her because I thought she would be concerned about me and instead just used it to her own advantage. Thankfully Friday and Saturday were pretty uneventful because I don't believe I could handle any more disappointment this week. Sorry for the rant, but it was kinda therapeutic to get it off my chest. It's nice to know that there are a couple people out there who will read this just so I'm not the only person who has to carry this shit. Even if I don't get any pizza, it's nice knowing that fact.

Thankfully Friday and Saturday were pretty uneventful because I don't believe I could handle any more disappointment this week. Sorry for the rant, but it was kinda therapeutic to get it off my chest. It's nice to know that there are a couple people out there who will read this just so I'm not the only person who has to carry this shit. Even if I don't get any pizza, it's nice knowing that fact.

kramapple,False,2,4,False,2,"So... I don't really know how to request pizza, especially since what I have to ask for probably makes me sound really... un-needy. I'm 24, flew myself out to Columbus Ohio to work with Cirque Du Soleil temporarily and only work four hours a day and we haven't gotten paid yet. I'm down to $100 and I use most of that to help get me to and from the Cirque site and I haven't eaten anything except some Bananas since yesterday. 

It's hard to ask for help, since I put myself here because I want to one day work for Cirque Du Soleil -- instead of just a temporary job working with a show while they are in a city. I plan on trying to follow them for a few more shows and hope the experience helps set my resume apart, as well as that I can practice some aerial arts (trapeze).

I absolutely love the show and the people I am following and it's really the show I want to work for but if I were to actually land a job with Cirque, I honestly would not mind any show.

Regardless, gluten makes me very sick so pizza typically isn't something I can get unless I order multiple little domino's gluten free pizza. I don't really know who else delivers in the downtown columbus area that has gluten free, and also since it's 1am.

I don't expect pizza, since GF is such a hassle but thank you for having a subreddit like this exist. ","So...

Nothing special about my story, but here goes.
A bit over a year ago, I bombed out of college. Hard. After that, I was unable to find a job, even in the pizza industry, where I have 3.5 years experience, 1.5 of those in management. Throughout the year I have been bouncing around between cities, going back to Eugene and Corvallis for a time, and eventually went to Texas because I wanted to meet a girl I'd been talking to online for a year and a half or so and was quite enamoured with. That journey was a complete disaster, and months after I wound up back in Portland, I still think about it everyday. I still can't find a job... I interviewed at Voodoo Donuts the day before yesterday, and by now I would have heard back if I'd gotten the job. I feel like I kicked ass at the interview, but most 'cool' jobs in Portland are always won by scrubby hipsters and overly-tatted indie/rocker chicks. I'm an electronic musician, an artist, and writer, and slowly over the last year I've been watching a lot of the stuff I use to do my work break or disappear. My speakers broke, so I can't properly make music, I ditched 80$ worth of art supplies while I was trying to hitchhike to Texas, as it was weighing me down. My laptop's hard drive fried out but I was lucky enough to trade a much smaller one for some computer repair work. I've been couch-surfing various places this whole time, right now I am staying at a nice rasta lady's house with her schizophrenic ex-boyfriend and his mother, who has alzheimers. I'm lucky in that I get to stay in a room that is half-filled with their storage stuff yet has a bed in it. But I can't remember the last time I had a good pizza. Nevertheless, there are certainly people worse off than myself and if I had stumbled upon this sub-reddit on my own, I would've though that it was awesome, but would likely not be requesting pizza on it. However, since it was suggested to me, I figure I might as well give it a go.

What can I offer you? Well, I can send you a bunch of mp3s of my music, mail you some drawings, or perhaps help with some editing work if you have any writing you need someone to look over, whether for school or for personal writing. I live in the St. Johns neighbourhood of North Portland. Hope I got everything I need here, lemme know any questions or otherwise. Thanks reddit.","So I posted this on my facebook today:

First off - I will **not** *starve* between now and Friday, so if you'd rather help someone who has absolutely nothing, I understand, appreciate your stance, and thank you for helping someone truly in need.  

I've been unemployed for better than two years. During that time, I watched most of my photography clients (I did a lot of corporate work) shut down their budgets for expenditures like me. As that income dwindled, I began looking for other work. I'm not sure how much the year-long gap of ""employment"" (other than self-employed) has mattered, but I haven't been able to find anything. About a week and a half ago I finally got to the point I had to take a laborer job that's physically killing me (ok, it's only very painful). So I'll have something coming my way soon.  

In the mean time, I have a 1/2 sack of potatoes, a few cans of corn, 1/2 jar of peanut butter, 3/4 loaf of bread, and a few boxes of mac and cheese. All of which is pretty much what I've been eating for the past couple of weeks. Like I said, I won't starve, but I damn sure don't have a meal I'm actually looking forward to for the next week.  

It's just me. My dog passed the day after Easter, and as much as I'd love another pet, I know I'm not in a position financially to take on another right now. So even a medium pizza would be like 4 meals - I could take a couple of slices to work every other day for lunch or something just to break the monotony of what I've been having.  

I'm not hiding behind a new account - I am who I am. A quick look at my profile will tell you exactly who I am, and hopefully give you a sense that I try to contribute to the community as well when I can (/r/TOMT, /r/picrequest, gift exchanges, postcards to kids/random people/etc., general blathering). You'll also see where I've sold some of my camera gear to a fellow redditor because I needed the money. I feel bad asking when it's not a matter of ""need it or I'll die"", but I figure if I'm just honest about where I am, someone might throw me a ~~bone~~ pizza in the spirit of the *Random Acts* part of the subreddit.

When he first started this job he was making amazing money. But things slowed down extremely. He went from bringing home $100-$200 a night to $15 or less a day. He also has to pay for gas which is $15 a day. So as you can see he's not making money at all right now.
    The only reason why he is staying with this job, is because the owner is making him co-owner next year and also letting him stock vending machines so he'll be making two salaries. So my husband is trying to keep whats best for our future in mind. 
  However I'm in starvation mode, I've lost 4 pounds in one week due to not eating. I've been snacking around the pieces of moldy bread, hoping for my husband to have a good day and hoping I hear back from the temp service that is suppose to be contacting me back.. I just called my husband and he's only at $60 (he makes 25% of that, which will be used for gas ) and he's going to be heading back to the shop in 20 minutes. So it's another bad day. My stomach is killing me. It would mean everything if someone could help out.
     I'm posting from an alternative account because I communicate with far away friends and I don't really want people to know how much we're failing right now.

I lost my job about a month and a half ago right before my SO's birthday.

Fast forward 2 weeks: my SO gets fired out of the blue by the new GM at the newsroom where he worked. He's been really down and has not yet been able to find a job. We had just signed our new lease so all of our money had gone to that and our bills. There is not much I can do for him at this point, seeing as I've only been working 2 or 3 days a week tops.

thumpingarnt,True,0,2,True,5,"Before I start, allow me to say that I do realize that I am new here. I am not someone who is out to score a free meal, I am honestly looking for some help right now.

OK so here is my story. I apologize in advance for the giant wall-of-text.

A couple of months ago our ceiling caved in, due to excessive rain and the landlord's refusal to fix the leak. We had been telling him for months that it was not fixed and it was still leaking, but he didn't care.

So the night that the ceiling caved in, I called the landlord and I told him politely, ""hey, your ceiling just fell in on us""

His exact words, were ""I don't really give a damn, I don't care about anything since you said you don't owe me any money""

Now this is funny, because for years this landlord would come around EVERY YEAR at tax time, and insist we owed him some insane amount of money. We had just been agreeing in the past, because it was possible we might have missed some payments here or there.

But this time was different. He claimed we owed him 3,400 dollars for 8 months of rent that we supposedly never paid him. So I tell him, give me the dates that you think we didn't pay, and I will run them against my receipts and see what's going on.

Well, when I finally get the dates, I cross-reference them to my receipts. And it turned out that we had actually OVER-PAID the landlord by 750 dollars - plus we had all the paperwork to prove it.

So I try to explain the situation with the guy, and he refuses to listen. So he files an eviction.

We go to court with photographs of the ceiling caved in that he refused to fix, the stack of receipts, his dates that he claimed we never paid - EVERYTHING.

Well the judge's exact words were ""I'm not too good with numbers, so we aren't going to get in to your stack of receipts""

The landlord also claimed that he never got the money orders, so I contacted Western Union, and I had them send me the front AND backs of them to show who they were made out to, and who signed and cashed them. Even after seeing these, he STILL claimed in front of the judge that he never got them - But they were clearly signed by him!!!

So the judge gave us 72 hours to get our shit and get out, when we were legally paid up for another 2 months........

So I had to spend 200 dollars on a storage unit, and we packed our entire lives into it. At this point, we are literally homeless. So I get a hotel room for myself, my fiancee, and our chocolate lab for the next week, just to have somewhere to sleep at night.

So that's another 200 dollars gone when we were actually paid up on the apartment and were wrongfully evicted.

After about 4 days in the hotel, we came in contact with the lady we are renting from now - she had a house available, this house - But it's 500 dollars/month for rent, plus utility costs...

Either way, we can't live out of a hotel at 200 dollars per week. So we agree and move in.

The house doesn't have a refrigerator, it doesn't have a washer/dryer. So we lived out of a cooler for the first month that we got here, until we were able to buy a cheap 75 dollar refrigerator.

This story just keeps going on &amp; on &amp; on.. I honestly couldn't type this whole thing out unless I wrote for a month.. This whole situation has just been insane.

Bottom line, I hate to ask for help. Especially like this.. 

But I do have photos of the entire process. From moving our things into storage to us living out of the hotel room, all the way up until we found this house, to today's rent payment.. I have the photos.. I have the receipts, I have everything...

So, the reason I am asking today is because we just spent our last 500 dollars that we had in the bank on the rent for the next month.

Neither of us gets paid for another 2 weeks.

If anyone can afford like 20 dollars or something so I could surprise her when she gets home from work with a pizza, some cheese sticks and a 2 liter of pepsi, that would be awesome. 

As far as proof goes, I can provide a scanned copy of the money order for the rent that I just sent out today, it was our last drop of money. (After we were evicted illegally, I now scan the front of the money order before sending them to prove who they were made out to if any disputes should ever come up.)

I would of course blank the recipient's name out, along with the address. But I would highlight the date it was purchased (today) so you can see that I'm not just making up some sob story. I couldn't make this shit up if I tried...

So anyway, again I apologize for the huge wall of text. If someone can help us, I deeply appreciate it and thank you in advance. If not, well at least I tried. It's better to try and fail, than not try and wonder what may have happened.

EDIT: To make it easier for people who are interested in possibly helping, I have blanked-out the money order and uploaded it.

Taking a pizza to the park is one of his favorite things.

I will be making offers next week, whether or not I get a pizza so even if you're just reading this and you're hungry be sure to check back with me then. :)

Somewhere along that path girl starts working for scumbag corporation. When it comes time for maternity leave as the lil' redditor is close to being born, scumbag corporation says 'don't worry, all of your benefits will continue, you'll get paid leave, have fun with teh baby cuddles.' 

Well, we really wish it had worked out like that :( I took a full 12 week leave, as available to me thanks to FMLA. 7 Weeks were paid thanks to short term disability, but my company made me wait 3 weeks to get that money, which sucked. My insurance and all of my benefits got cancelled while I was on leave, even though I was assured they'd continue. When I got back to work two weeks ago I fought tooth and nail to get them back, but my benefits department is making me pay out of pocket for the premiums from the time I was on leave and the benefits got cancelled. That adds up to $200 a week... multiplied by 12! They are automatically deducting the payments from my paychecks for the next 4 weeks, after already doing so for my last two checks. They are leaving me with so little in my checks that we've had to dig deeply into our savings just to start paying our bills, and unfortunately we've had to give up grocery shopping until my premiums are caught up and scumbag corporation takes them back over. 

Luckily our adorable son gets all he needs from me, so my husband and I are just living off of what's in our pantry, and that has been box after box of pasta. We'd kill for something with flavor at this point, and a pizza sounds like heaven. As soon as we get caught up financially, which according to my strict budget won't be until late November, I plan on doing the same for another redditor in need! 

tl,dr; My company is basically making me pay for my maternity leave after the fact, to the sum of $2400. We can't afford groceries because of this right now and would just love one night where we can have the luxury of a pizza.

Anyway I was cycling around today and I was just setting off from the center of the city where I live when I spotted a Specialized bicycle with a flat tyre. Thinking of being the good samaritan, I decided to wait around and give this friend in need some much required assistance.  
  
Shortly along comes his girlfriend, who sees me pushing on the tire (to check the pressure). She isn't aggressive or suchlike but she does go and get her boyfriend, who upon realisation of my motive is thankful for the assist. This is where it gets interesting - turns out this guy's ""friend"" had asked him for drug money, and when he had declined, the ""friend"" had slashed his tire with a knife - in fact, quite a large one. This friend was also sat across the street, well within viewing distance.

Naturally, I'm suddenly feeling a little less confident about this whole thing. Nonetheless, I grab my pump and toolkit saddlebag, and start whipping out the gear. We get the tire off just as another of this dude's ""friends"" comes over, and starts to be generally unhelpful and stand around in the way... whatever, I can still deal. His girlfriend also comes over, and they begin chatting about general shit. One topic that keeps coming up is how the gentleman I am in the midst of assisting is ""still on tag"" - which means they have been convicted of some kind of crime in the UK. Normally a tag also involves a curfew, and they are often handed out for violent crime. Nice. Turns out his mate is also ""on tag"". Nothing quite like roadside repair while surrounded by individuals with a penchant for violence should things not go their way.

By this point, we have patched the tube in two places and all seems well. On goes the tire, with the help of my handy tyre lever - or so we thought. The guy with the violent past is obviously not too much in control of his strength, as he snaps my tyre lever in half. Lovely. Just to top it all off, the guy's tire is still flat. Turns out two 1cm holes opposite each other on the tube just won't patch properly. Who'da thunk it? So anyway, ""thanks anyway""s are exchanged, and I begin the ride home - only to find that while leaving the site of my ad-hoc repairwork, I have a nice chunk of glass lodged in my own tire, and my tube is deflating with a deeply unwelcome hiss.

Defeated, I begin the long walk (push) to the nearest bike shop. Rather than treating myself to the takeaway I had been previously planning to devour, I find myself rather forlornly spending the money on a new tyre lever so that I can repair my own bicycle and actually make it home. Upon arrival I find myself faced with half a can of beans or something unidentifiable and frozen. While my need may not be so great as that of other Redditors, I hope at least that my story has been enjoyable. Thanks for reading to the end!

I just moved in with my sister and brother in law.. They bought a new house and need a roommate, and knowing that I am just out of college and looking for work and all that.. they got me to do it. :P

The first week I moved down here, the small amount of money that I had to get through to find a job was frozen in my bank account because Bank of America is such a PoS. I was literally down here a week, and without any notice/phone call/email.. etc. they froze my account and reissued my debit card back to my parents house where I was living (a days trip away, in another state). I was there planning to cancel my account, when they told me I was going to be unable to do so without my new card... that was a couple of days away in the mail. So basically I am broke as shit. :/

I just started my new job down here, but they pay bi-weekly. I just received my first check, but it immediately had to go to the new bank that I have for student loans and car insurance, to avoid late payments. So for the next two weeks I am broke and even have to bum gas money off of my sister to get to work until I am paid, and she cant really afford to be helping me as much as she is already.

I'd really like to do something nice for her in the meantime... so, anyone want to give me a hand?

I hate asking for charity. But it's been a rough couple of weeks. I have no money for the next couple of days, no way of earning more that quickly, and not much food bar some baked beans in the fridge.

On top of that, I'm ill. Not Beastie Boys ill, 'all my joints hurt and my hands won't stop shaking, I hate flu' ill. I should emphasise that I'm not starving, though. It's not 'please send me pizza, I have nothing to eat', it's 'please send me pizza, I don't want to have to eat the same terrible cheap food for the next couple of days'.

And it is written, man cannot live on beans alone, so I was hoping one of you might be generous enough to help me out. The full sob story's available on request if you're interested, plus pictures or whatever verification. Thanks for reading.","Hi Reddit.

     3 cups sugar
     1 1/2 cups water (use coconut, almond, or regular milk if you've got it)
     2/3 cups of coco
What you wanna do is boil the shit out of these 3 ingredients until they pass the ""hard ball"" test... What's that you ask? you just drizzle a little bit of the mixture into a bowl of cold water and if you can reach in and form a ball your mixture passed (Test frequently until you have the hang of making fudge)... Once your fudge passes the test turn off the heat and toss in a TSP of Vanilla and a Half a stick of butter if you've got it (I made mine with just sugar water and cocoa last night and it was still good). At this point you can toss stuff in your chocolate goo... Nuts, Raisins, those little cranberry raisin thingies... Ya know whatever, I like to dump a load of peanut butter in there when I have it.

It dawned on me that I had all the stuff for vegan fudge, I'm not vegan, or vegetarian, but I am pretty clever. Here's what I had for dinner. 
     3 cups sugar
     1 1/2 cups water (use coconut, almond, or regular milk if you've got it)
     2/3 cups of coco
What you wanna do is boil the shit out of these 3 ingredients until they pass the ""hard ball"" test... What's that you ask? you just drizzle a little bit of the mixture into a bowl of cold water and if you can reach in and form a ball your mixture passed (Test frequently until you have the hang of making fudge)... Once your fudge passes the test turn off the heat and toss in a TSP of Vanilla and a Half a stick of butter if you've got it (I made mine with just sugar water and cocoa last night and it was still good). At this point you can toss stuff in your chocolate goo... Nuts, Raisins, those little cranberry raisin thingies... Ya know whatever, I like to dump a load of peanut butter in there when I have it. Super easy!
