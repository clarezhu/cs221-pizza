We spent somewhere over $100 on his initial vet bill, Critical Care (this oatmeal like grain food to have him gain weight), hot pack, hot water bottle, space heater, and an extra amount of his favorite veggies.  I also work 2 hours away (seasonal position, I basically just get work whenever I tell my boss I'll be in town) and had to cancel my shifts for tomorrow and Sunday.  My boyfriend has missed work to care for him, and I've missed school so I'm also way behind.



He needs 24 hour care so we're taking turns sleeping and watching him, and both of us are never out of the house at the same time.  He's eating more, we're keeping his temperature consistent, but he's not gaining any weight.  His mate died a few months ago, so we think that's why he stopped eating.  This is taking every bit of our energy.



If he doesn't start gaining weight soon, he'll need blood tests, stool sample tests, and a couple others along with an increased dose of Critical Care, an antibiotic, and a probiotic.  The estimate from the vet was just over $400, so we're cutting corners everywhere we can.  Keep in mind, that money doesn't count for the extra veggies from the grocery store (our rabbits always get fresh veggies, but since Bugs is now refusing timothy hay, which is supposed to take up a large majority of his diet) we're having to buy, which is going to add up over the next few weeks, possibly longer if he continues to ignore his hay.




So, if you've made it this far, I'm just asking for a pizza, or pasta, or something from Pizza Hut, Dominoes, or Black Jack (those are the closest places to us).  If you have a random gift card for *any* restaurant in the Tucson area, we'll be grateful for that too/instead.  Anything to keep us from Ramen would be so appreciated.




**TL;DR** Our rabbit is incredibly sick, and we've already spent just approximately $131 on his special care, not including the extra veggies.  This was our grocery budget until the next paycheck comes in, and we've both had to miss work to stay and care for him since he needs literally 24/7 monitoring.  The vet gave us an estimate of $400 for extra tests he could need if his condition doesn't improve.  After we run out of the food in the house, we're going to be on ramen for at least 2 weeks, possibly a month or longer until he gets better.  Pizza wold be wonderful.","Our rabbit, Bugs got sick.

This puts me in a bad mood. I storm home. He texts ""What's wrong?"" I tell him ""You, punching me.""

Add in having to pay out of our pocket to clean our apartment we JUST moved into to make it anywhere near livable, and I'm stuck with $0.57 in my name until my paycheck hits the 21st. 

So... If you want to cheer two broke college students on a ramen-diet up, it'd be much appreciated!

Nothing terribly special... UK dweller (South East Coast represent) who lost my job last August, ekeing out a living for the last 6 months or so on my severance pay but nothing has come up yet.

I've held out for as long as I can without making a claim for any benefits (which I've just started on) and have been living super frugal for the last month or so. 39p pasta sauce and a can of tuna only gets you so far before you want to throw in the towel. Come Monday I can stock up on some more varied food stuffs again (and pick up those Skyrim PS3 DLCs that have been rubbing my nose in my shitty financials) but right now, I'm hankering for some comfort food.

OK so here is my story. I apologize in advance for the giant wall-of-text.

A couple of months ago our ceiling caved in, due to excessive rain and the landlord's refusal to fix the leak. We had been telling him for months that it was not fixed and it was still leaking, but he didn't care.

So the night that the ceiling caved in, I called the landlord and I told him politely, ""hey, your ceiling just fell in on us""

His exact words, were ""I don't really give a damn, I don't care about anything since you said you don't owe me any money""

Now this is funny, because for years this landlord would come around EVERY YEAR at tax time, and insist we owed him some insane amount of money. We had just been agreeing in the past, because it was possible we might have missed some payments here or there.

But this time was different. He claimed we owed him 3,400 dollars for 8 months of rent that we supposedly never paid him. So I tell him, give me the dates that you think we didn't pay, and I will run them against my receipts and see what's going on.

Well, when I finally get the dates, I cross-reference them to my receipts. And it turned out that we had actually OVER-PAID the landlord by 750 dollars - plus we had all the paperwork to prove it.

So I try to explain the situation with the guy, and he refuses to listen. So he files an eviction.

We go to court with photographs of the ceiling caved in that he refused to fix, the stack of receipts, his dates that he claimed we never paid - EVERYTHING.

Well the judge's exact words were ""I'm not too good with numbers, so we aren't going to get in to your stack of receipts""

The landlord also claimed that he never got the money orders, so I contacted Western Union, and I had them send me the front AND backs of them to show who they were made out to, and who signed and cashed them. Even after seeing these, he STILL claimed in front of the judge that he never got them - But they were clearly signed by him!!!

So the judge gave us 72 hours to get our shit and get out, when we were legally paid up for another 2 months........

So I had to spend 200 dollars on a storage unit, and we packed our entire lives into it. At this point, we are literally homeless. So I get a hotel room for myself, my fiancee, and our chocolate lab for the next week, just to have somewhere to sleep at night.

So that's another 200 dollars gone when we were actually paid up on the apartment and were wrongfully evicted.

After about 4 days in the hotel, we came in contact with the lady we are renting from now - she had a house available, this house - But it's 500 dollars/month for rent, plus utility costs...

Either way, we can't live out of a hotel at 200 dollars per week. So we agree and move in.

The house doesn't have a refrigerator, it doesn't have a washer/dryer. So we lived out of a cooler for the first month that we got here, until we were able to buy a cheap 75 dollar refrigerator.

This story just keeps going on &amp; on &amp; on.. I honestly couldn't type this whole thing out unless I wrote for a month.. This whole situation has just been insane.

Bottom line, I hate to ask for help. Especially like this.. 

But I do have photos of the entire process. From moving our things into storage to us living out of the hotel room, all the way up until we found this house, to today's rent payment.. I have the photos.. I have the receipts, I have everything...

So, the reason I am asking today is because we just spent our last 500 dollars that we had in the bank on the rent for the next month.

Neither of us gets paid for another 2 weeks.

If anyone can afford like 20 dollars or something so I could surprise her when she gets home from work with a pizza, some cheese sticks and a 2 liter of pepsi, that would be awesome. 

As far as proof goes, I can provide a scanned copy of the money order for the rent that I just sent out today, it was our last drop of money. (After we were evicted illegally, I now scan the front of the money order before sending them to prove who they were made out to if any disputes should ever come up.)

I would of course blank the recipient's name out, along with the address. But I would highlight the date it was purchased (today) so you can see that I'm not just making up some sob story. I couldn't make this shit up if I tried...

So anyway, again I apologize for the huge wall of text. If someone can help us, I deeply appreciate it and thank you in advance. If not, well at least I tried. It's better to try and fail, than not try and wonder what may have happened.

EDIT: To make it easier for people who are interested in possibly helping, I have blanked-out the money order and uploaded it.

I just sat down to eat a bowl of noodles.  As I said my grace and waited for the food to cool down, I was overwhelmed by a million thoughts.  I just wanted to share them and maybe let someone know they're not alone.

Last week I ""celebrated"" one year of being unemployed.  Ironically it coincided with 6 months of being officially divorced, though the marriage was over long before that.  Today marks two weeks since I scrounged around the house to find every penny and spent them all to cover the bills.  For 2 weeks I've tried to get by without any money.  I've restricted my use of the car to only places I absolutely had to go.  I haven't been to the grocery store in God knows how long.  The first week wasn't awful.  I didn't have much in terms of food around the house, but it forced me to be creative.  This second week has been much less enjoyable.  Some cereal, some pasta, a little of this, and less of that.  You don't realize how long two weeks is until you find yourself counting down every day.  I am hoping to get some relief in terms of an unemployment check on Wednesday.  What I was told though is it could be delayed because I have to re-qualify after one year.  What a proud moment for me.  I've run into issues before, and it doesn't matter that it's not your fault, they usually can't get the money to you until the following Monday.  We'll see how that goes.  I've had Wednesday circled on the calendar in my head as this all magical day.  Realistically most of the money is already spoken for in upcoming bills, but I'll have a little bit of money for grocery shopping.  Right now, and I realize this is a gross combination, I'm craving a glass of milk, and a hamburger :)  

Anyway, the short story is that life sucks right now and I was kind of getting down.  Actually I was really in a bad place.  And as I said a blessing over the ""meal"", I realized that there are millions of people that would gladly step into my shoes.  That my life may seem rough right now, but that's more of a testament to how far I had risen, than to how far I've fallen.  

I just want to say thank you to all of you on here that are helping people.  It's an honorable calling.  And to all of you that truly need help, just know that it will get better.  I firmly believe that we will never be given more than we can handle, and we're never in it alone.  I know how sad and depressing life can be, but I also know how you don't have to look far to find someone who needs help more than ourselves.  

I guess I just wanted to say hang in there.  To everyone.  Keep fighting.  Don't give up.  If you're having a bad day, if you want to rant and rave or scream and cry, send me a message.  If you got that job interview you've been praying for, let me know.  I want to hear the bad.  I want to share in the good.  I have tried to weather the storm alone, and it doesn't work.  I don't need someone to carry me, but it sure is nice to have someone to lean on.

So as Tiny Tim say, ""God bless us, everyone.""

A pizza will most definitely get me through to my next paycheck and keep me afloat. Verification code / address / pics / anything else you want available upon request!

I'm very grateful to even have a place to ask for help, so thank you very, very much.

I was with my girlfriend on her 18th birthday and she really wanted to go down to the arcade. We're a new couple, so of course I'm trying to look cool in front of her so I say something along the lines of ""Alright, if you really want to,"" when really I wanted to shout at the top of my excitement ""ARE YOU SURE IT'S YOU'RE BIRTHDAY AND NOT MINE BECAUSE I LOVE THE ARCADE, WOOOOO--""


So we're at the arcade playing these goofy silly games, like the game where you put a quarter in and you watch your quarter go down into a pile of quarters and there is a metal bar that just might push more quarters down into the prize pit and ANYWAY, we're having fun.


So she eventually has to go to the little girl's room and she forgets to bring her phone. I took her phone and started counting up our tickets when all of a sudden her phone gets a text and a picture of her best friend's face pops up on the screen. I don't like to go through other peoples texts, but I see the word ""Tony"" before I put the phone back in my pocket, which is my first name.
So I read just the 1 text. It states:
""Tony better remember what you asked for last week.""
My stomach got this twisted feeling of ""oh crap how could I forget."" 


!!!!! 


JUST THEN --- A pizza delivery guy from the pizza place right next door is walking out to his car about to leave, so I rush him and scream ""hey wait!"". I ask him what kind of pizza, how much was it, and paid him in full plus a 10$ tip. I asked him to hold the pizza for a minute, and ran across the street to the joke shop and bought a gag sausage (don't ask me why there was one there, I wasn't paying attention at the time.)


I took the gag sausage back to the pizza, took out my pocket knife, and cut up a slice small enough to look similar to a pepperoni. Next, I took a pen and paper and wrote a note and pinned it down with a candle on top and just then, she's walks out of the bathroom and I start singing happy birthday. People around the room joined in and we all clapped for her as she blew out the candle.


She has this ear to ear smile that is to die for. She gave me a fairly large 'thank you' kiss and said ""I thought you forgot!"".


She took the note off of the fake pepperoni and read it. ""I will love you until the last pepperoni fades."" she starting crying like she just won the lottery.

---- Now, fast forwarding 5 years later, we are still happily together and enjoying our youth, but her birthday is today and I plan to have dinner with her this evening.


I would love to see someone else kind enough to pass down a pizza to a young couple in love.","Hello RoaP! I just want to go into a small amount of detail in this post and tell you guys how much we're in love. I will keep this post as appropriate as possible for the amount of detail I'll be going in to.


I was with my girlfriend on her 18th birthday and she really wanted to go down to the arcade. We're a new couple, so of course I'm trying to look cool in front of her so I say something along the lines of ""Alright, if you really want to,"" when really I wanted to shout at the top of my excitement ""ARE YOU SURE IT'S YOU'RE BIRTHDAY AND NOT MINE BECAUSE I LOVE THE ARCADE, WOOOOO--""


So we're at the arcade playing these goofy silly games, like the game where you put a quarter in and you watch your quarter go down into a pile of quarters and there is a metal bar that just might push more quarters down into the prize pit and ANYWAY, we're having fun.


So she eventually has to go to the little girl's room and she forgets to bring her phone. I took her phone and started counting up our tickets when all of a sudden her phone gets a text and a picture of her best friend's face pops up on the screen. I don't like to go through other peoples texts, but I see the word ""Tony"" before I put the phone back in my pocket, which is my first name.
So I read just the 1 text. It states:
""Tony better remember what you asked for last week.""
My stomach got this twisted feeling of ""oh crap how could I forget."" 


!!!!! 


JUST THEN --- A pizza delivery guy from the pizza place right next door is walking out to his car about to leave, so I rush him and scream ""hey wait!"". I ask him what kind of pizza, how much was it, and paid him in full plus a 10$ tip. I asked him to hold the pizza for a minute, and ran across the street to the joke shop and bought a gag sausage (don't ask me why there was one there, I wasn't paying attention at the time.)


I took the gag sausage back to the pizza, took out my pocket knife, and cut up a slice small enough to look similar to a pepperoni. Next, I took a pen and paper and wrote a note and pinned it down with a candle on top and just then, she's walks out of the bathroom and I start singing happy birthday. People around the room joined in and we all clapped for her as she blew out the candle.

So backstory. Last year (I was 18), I was sexually assaulted by a stranger not too far from Harvard Square. It resulted in some severe PTSD: I couldn't sleep or eat. I was hardly able to function or focus enough to even engage in casual conversation. I couldn't stand to exist in my own mind any longer so I tried to fix it by drinking, which only made me feel sick and more depressed. I tried smoking weed (I'd smoked often before and it seemed to help then) but now the weed gave me flashbacks to the assault and made it so much worse. I was getting desperate. I don't know how the idea got into my head, but one morning I was getting dressed and I just made the decision. It was this voice of deliberate recklessness that announced, ""Today I'm going to try heroin.""

It was alarmingly easy to get my hands on it. It was cheap and it was everything I needed. I knew it was stupid, but I didn't care. I had nothing left to lose - and why stop when it works?

Well eventually I ended up in a psych hospital for the PTSD and heroin addiction. I got help, I got my shit together, and I'm going to college.
