My husband and I have been kicked off of food stamps for a few days because of paperwork not going through. We're getting that fixed, but money is super tight, and my parents showed up today to help finish the tiling in my grandma's bathroom. The house (especally upstairs) has little to no air condition, and it's really hot. I was hoping to offer a pizza for them for dinner when the work is done?

They really should get to eat, and we don't have the money, or food in the house, to feed them. So if anyone wants to buy us a pizza or 2 to share, that would be fantastic. 

If you want proof of my parent's work, I can provide that. 

Thanks in advance.

I'm about another month of being poor away from my goal weight but food would be awesome too. Not sure how this works. Just looking for a small pizza (I think that would probably get me a couple of meals) and maybe a soda? My concern though is that I don't have enough cash to tip the driver for delivery and I think carry out has ended. Do these deals work somehow with tip included?

I keep trying to work from home and sell my stuff on ebay etc. but I never will equal the amount that she gives without any hesitation.

I have not been able to take this girl out for dinner in 3 years and she works full time.  It would make my lifetime to be able to surprise her with pizza that was acquired by me.

*as a caveat my illness causes me to not be able to eat, consequently I am not excited about food much less cooking it and not eating it so this would save me from that too for a night :)
