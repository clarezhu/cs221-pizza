I'm in need of food :( 

I have been living off mcdoubles since the 25th of last month when my rental company forced us out of our rental 5 days early. Ramen and eggs are getting old, as well as dollar cheeseburgers. 

I would love a pizza to thank a dear friend of mine for the $20 loan to pay my virgin mobile bill, paying him back tomorrow after selling plasma. Would be awesome to share. 

I could repay you in house cleaning if your in the area, or if you need a personal chef for a night, I have references! Or I can draw you some awesomely cheesy artwork since I won't have cash to pay you back.

This is my first time posting in this sub, saw all the kindness and was really touched. Faith in humanity can rest easy on this sub's shoulders. 

Sorry for rambling, just remembered this sub and thought it was worth a shot! Here's to hoping! Have a fantastic day :3

However, wifey is already starting to feel the post-partum depression setting in.  She feels like we will never be able to enjoy life again because money is a little tight right now.  We both have jobs, etc. so things will be better.  However the tastiest food we have had is Hamburger Helper made with 70/30 beef in the past week and a half.

And so, a random pizza would be great...

TL;DR New Baby, The mother is depressed because we are eating out of cans already, trying to lift her spirits.

Can provide proof of everything above.

Anyway, this is my second semester of living in an apartment and I'm still working on getting a budget together. Normally I do a fairly good job, but this semesters worth of books cost about double what I had originally planned for. Normally this wouldn't be too much of a problem, but in a town this small it's very hard to find a job. So I was hoping that a nice meal would be just the break I needed before I get back to struggling through the rest of the semester.

I had the phone hearing, I know I am in the right, I got a w2 from them with taxes taken out. But until the final call is made, my unemployment checks are being withheld. It has been 2 weeks now, well 3 unemployment checks. I have been steadily looking for work. My phone got shut off the other day and I had to use $80 of my last $100 to pay it so I can receive phone interviews. 

I bought some ramen and have been eating it for most of my meals for the past week now, my Thanksgiving dinner looks like more of the same.  I would really like some protein, something tasty and feel full again after a meal.

I live in Chicago, IL which has a million and a half great pizza joints but I am by no means picky, just hungry. Could anyone help a guy out? Once I find a job and back on my feet I would be more than happy to ""pizza it forward"" or pay you back. Thanks reddit.","[Request]Chicago, IL - Thanksgiving dinner is looking like ramen.

t3_vlcew,N/A,False,5,4,False,4,"Dear reddit:

I am a long time follower but have only recently just registered. A long story short is I am fucked!!! I am a 30 year old male from St.Catharines, Ontario (Neil Peart, Linda Evangelista, Paul Bernardo, Karla Homolka, Dave Thomas (SCTV), Alexisonfire, The Trews, etc, etc) who was evicted as of today and my place to live just fell through! I have no where to live so as soon as the sheriff shows up I'm homeless and though I have $40 on me I  want to save it incase I need a ghetto hotel room for me and my girl.

A little back story here, as I feel it's needed to shed some light as how I got to this point; when I moved into this place I was working steady overtime in sales but got laid off soon after I moved here. Not to worry I quickly found full time work, working midnight shift for a company called CCSI which had a contract to clean the New Food Classics plant here in St.Catharines. I have worked since I was 16 and am now 30 so no work was driving me nuts so I took first job I could get.

The job itself wasn't bad but the amount of corners they cut was very noticable. My very first day of work they told me the safety video was broken so I would have to do the training in a few days... I didn't get training until after I called Ministry Of Labor (Ontario) which was after I was already injured, but I I'll speak about this later.
 
I did the work no problem and was quickly promoted within 2 weeks, though that was partly due to the high turnover there as most people hated the job and quit.

While working there I requested training weekly with my manager to which he would reply some excuse about the dvd still being broken or doing it next week. Not wanting to be a bitch I kept working despite my concerns.

Fast forward a few weeks and we have an inspection from CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency)so everything has to be tip top. One of the duties when CFIA comes apparently was the ceilings of the plant had to be squeegeed dry as to not have any condensation from the cleaning drip into the frozen foods that were being made there (ie; burgers, ribetts).

While I was squeegeeing the cook room while my co-workers were out smoking, not working, I spent 2 and a half hrs doing it myself with a squeegee on the end of a 20 ft pole. Afterwards I couldn't move my neck without severe pain and later after my shift I couldn't sit in a chair without severe pain. I tried to sleep as it was the end of a midnight shift but my muscles would spasm to the point I couldn't sleep. I then called TeleHealth and they advised I go to a walk in clinic.

There I was diagnosed with a sprain of the left and right traps and lats, I think, traps for sure though.and sent for 3 months of physio due to the severity of the sprain. I did the entire 3 months but still no relief but the entire time my pysiotherapist is telling me there is something more there,

A month later Im at a hospital with insane back pain after vaccuming which I hadnt done since injury and I get x-rays. Doctor at hospital I need to see family doctor and have MRI.

See family doctor a month later, do some tests and he sends me for MRI. MRI results come back a month and half later. 2 herniated discs, spinal stenosis and degenerative bone disease caused by injury at work. Prognosis: No bending, No lifting, No twisting... FOR LIFE!

July 4th I see a neurologist for an EMG to determine whether I have back surgery but I have already been told they can't fix my back it will only be if it can improve my quality of life.

Oh and because WSIB says my back should be healed because its only a back sprain that takes 3 months to heal, I am all better, I have no income, no food, am being evicted as of today (June 25th) for back rent 3 months ($3300) but on the bright side I do have a lawyer but it's taking forever and welfare is not enough!!

Can reddit help with a pizza for what may be my last night indoors for a while? 

I can prove anything I just dont have a scanner so I would have to take a photo with cell and upload it.

Anyway, I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and I've been feeling like absolute shit for the past week, and my family doesn't even get it. They just say that I'm screwing up and I feel like I can't take it anymore. (╥﹏╥)

This week I managed to find her a ride here for our six months together and she's excited cause I planned it all out for her. I'm the first boyfriend shes ever had. She never dated anyone in high school so she got lucky with not having to deal with childish drama. We're going to Frank and Sons in the morning (her first time there), coming back to my place and relaxing with a nice massage (she loves them)  while we finish up our last four episode of Game of thrones season three. I have an intention to cook, but since I've been taking the bus. My funds are low and I haven't been able to buy anything to cook with. So I'm stuck with Easy Mac and a cake that I baked for her. A pizza would really help me out so I can at least buy food for the rest of the weekend so we can eat and if I'm lucky have some left over for Handel's (best ice cream ever). I just want to give her a relaxing day and weekend since she's been working so hard to pay for a new car. Thanks for considering to read all of that if you did!","[Request] USA, CAL.

It amazes me to no end to see the kindness still left in some people, and pushes me forward to keep providing that same kindness to others whenever I am able.

Hello fellow Redditors. I'm probably gonna rant and make a bigger deal of this than I should, and I'll try to keep it short and simple. But let me mention, I am NOT one to ask for assistance. But there comes times when we must swallow our pride.

I have a small family of three, just my daughter, my wife, and myself. I'm a mechanic by trade, and make an acceptable amount of money...normally. The last month has been very rough, with work being slow and hours being cut. We are in an apartment that costs us $325/wk, and that is killing us. We've had to cut off both phones, and recently our car took a turn for the worst and left us without transportation.

I've been able to keep food in the house, up until the last week or so. Mostly thanks to foodstamps, but those funds have run out. This last week I've had to pay back some small debts to my boss and father, and it's really hurt.

Also, our stove at this apartment doesn't work, so we've had to basically resort to microwave, cold prep foods, and a single burner hotplate. My cupboards and fridge are empty, short of some month old ice cream and leftovers that we've been too lazy to throw away. My family is hungry, but just for the day.

So here is my request, which I will counter with an offer. In exchange for a pizza, I will buy 2 other people in need a pizza in the near future. This is my way of setting aside the guilt of asking, and expanding the assistance of RAOP. I can provide any and all proof and verification needed. And whatever happens, I'd still like to thank RAOP for all their awesomeness.

NOTE: Come Monday, I can get my paycheck advanced to me. Yesterday we just barely slid by, and all will be well from Moday on. I've got a second job that I start Tuesday at. It's just rather...depressing(maybe even desperate) feeling to be hungry, have an empty wallet, and feel like there is nothing I can do. Thanks again Reddit. :)

EDIT: I'm so sorry, I completely forgot to put my location, and I kept saying it in my head. :P Anyways, I'm in South Florida, right by Ft. Lauderdale.

This week he received a vacation for all of the days he's gone in early or when it was his day off and we've been waiting for Thursday (he gives plasma Thurs/Sat) for a night to finally have money for some good food.

On his way home from the Biolife center a few minutes ago he called me and said he was stuck at a gas station because he tried using the Biolife card to get gas.

My husband pulled the pump out to use it, realized the car was too far back, and put the pump back to pull the car forward. Somehow by doing that something got cancelled and the money is being withheld. When he called the card company they said it could be up to 7 days before it goes back into the account. My husband had to call his boss and ask if he could use the business card for $3 in gas to get home that he'd pay back Monday.

t3_lmy9r,N/A,False,2,7,True,9,"Hey RAoP

This is a throwaway account but I'd be happy to PM you from my real account as verification. I've given before and never received.

First up I'd like to say that pizza is NOT necessary and we won't starve without it. Not even a bit. We've got some leftovers in the freezer and a bunch of odds and ends in the cupboards and even a bunch of friends who'd take us out to dinner or have us over if we asked (but we'd feel bad asking because we're old enough to be meant to be beyond this!). So, absolutely no worries if no-one can give. 

I'm asking because a bunch of unexpected grown up expenses just ambushed us. My boyfriend's grandfather died unexpectedly and we wanted to go to the funeral - but it was 5 hours away and we didn't have a car. So we bought a cheap car and made it to the funeral, but it turns out that car ownership is super expensive. Rego is nearly $1000! Add insurance, NRMA membership (needed cos we weren't sure whether our little bomb of a car would make the drive and we didnt want to be stranded in the australian outback forever), random fees for vehicle inspections and more random fees just for existing add up to be the value of the car again! What. The. Hell. (yes, I *have* lived a sheltered life, thank you for asking.)

Add that to the billion and one other things we're saving up for/need to pay (rent, bills, house deposit, wedding, honeymoon maybe, helping our families) and it's come as a bit of a shock to our financial system :P
We literally have $0.67 in the bank and a bit of change in cash until pay day. This is an odd and disconcerting feeling. 

What would pizza mean to us? Laughter and joy. The pleasure of knowing that there are good people who care about strangers. A memory to carry with us both when things are hard and when things are good and we can give again. A small easing of financial stress for the next few days. 

I might also pull the request later because like I said - it's most definitely not a do or die type situation. And anyway, my credit card's taken such a pounding this week, what harm is pizza going to do? :P

I'm a single guy, no girlfriend or wife or children that I know of, so I don't have a lot of mouths to feed, but I would love to at least stuff my face with something greasy and warm tonight and wallow in my sorrows.

Thanks reddit, you guys are all awesome.  ","Hey guys,

I've got the next 2 days off and while I will be able to buy some food Saturday with my grill tips I only usually make about $15 bucks after a 6 hour shift.

I work at one of my school's IT help desks. It's our fall break, and I'm here alone from 2p-10p central. Normally, I'd get a lunch break, but as I'm the only one here (no supervisor, or anything), and I don't have a key, I can't leave the office.

Delivery is fine, but I'm running low on cash until payday. A tight spot to be in this week, but I'm usually OK. When I get off, there will be campus food I can get, so it's really a matter of making it til 10pm.

Wasn't really looking for handouts or whatever when I posted that, still not really - this subreddit popped up in the sidebar.

I used to do a lot of work in SecondLife, and often I would get people to pay me in pizza.  When I was capable, I gifted people in pizza as well.  I like the idea of sharing a meal rather than being paid directly, seems more friendly.  I'll see what I can do to eventually become a pizza gifter here.

Anyway, if you feel like gifting me a pizza, there is a mom and pop pizza shop I can walk to here you could call and order a pizza directly.  They have a deal mon - wed with a medium one topping for $5.99, or large for like $2 more.  A while back, I had a friend order me a pizza directly with them, no problem.  I'm simple pizza wise - like pepperoni with extra sauce.

I've been living mostly off of ramen (cold-cooked as I have no stove) and dollar menu at McDs, so  pizza would actually be nice.

This is a really cool subreddit.  Hopefully I'll be able to repay the kindness sooner rather than later by passing on a pizza to someone else in need.

I live mid-way down the east coast, and will get more specific when I give whoever the details.  I wasn't asked for the card the time before, I'm thinking an out of state order would be fine.

Wow, if someone does this, thanks so much!  If not, still glad I found this subreddit.  Cool concept - great way to get some actual kharma :D","My story can be found here:

Management at my work has cut all of the cashiers' hours down to 25hrs a week.

I hate asking for help, but I figure, what the hell, it's just some pizza and I'd love to pay it forward.

7 Weeks ago my dad said his friend was moving in because she needed a place to stay. She arrived the next day and moved into the downstairs guest bedroom with her baby daughter. Four days later her 12 year old daughter moved in upstairs next to me. My dad never cooks and this is fine because I'll cook for myself and enjoy cooking. But I've noticed the food disappearing more and more, when I asked my father to go shopping he did about 2 weeks later and to my surprise 2 more people moved in. Friends of my dads from Tennessee. They were only here for a week but when they left there was no food again. When I asked my dad if I could go shopping with him he said he didn't have the money to feed all these people and asked the women with the 2 daughters to find a place. It feels like it's been forever and they are still here. There's almost nothing I can make to eat besides ramen and corn. The only thing she buys is junk food but not even anything you would want to eat as a snack. Ice creme, ice creme cake, microwave dinners which I can't eat because it's for her ""diet"", and baby food.

What I've been doing is just going out and eating but I quit my last job and began to work with my father. It was hard work and good pay but we live in Florida and it's rain so much the past few days we haven't been able to work and he hasn't giving me a paycheck. Like I said there is corn, ramen, and ice creme I CAN eat. I really rather not but if you are generous enough to give someone a pizza, try and find someone in more need than I am. If you can't and decide to help me out I will LOVE YOU!

Thanks for reading and I'll answer any questions.

TL;DR: Guest who've been staying at my house eat everything and leave me nothing. Haven't left after being asked to. I'm terrible at writing.

::EDIT::
NVM! My mother invited me over to dinner and to pick me up as well. (parents are divorced)
A concerned friend also invited me out to dinner and asked if I needed cat food. I have four cats but I assured the friend they are fine and they truly are. I have 2 full bags of cat food. :)

I would love to surprise him with a pizza some night, maybe get his mind off the whole situation, but I just can't swing it financially at this point, and was wondering if you were still helping out those within the community.

If not, I completely understand, you've provided a huge service to this community already, but I'll keep my fingers crossed.

 i think this is a nice idea, i'd definitely pay it forward when i get paid. Ask when you need, give when you can...right? Thanks if you can, no worries if you can't :)
