But I also have no illusions about this and I'm well-aware that the responsibility lies squarely in my hands. That said, I know how effective something as simple as a pizza would be in raising the spirits around here so I'm sucking it up and asking for help from a community I've valued for quite some time now.

My wife is vegetarian, so I would request a cheese pizza. My local Dominos is the cheapest I know of and has a coupon for an extra large 1-topping for $9.99 ($13.26 w/tax), which is actually better than the regular price of a large ($14.37 w/tax). There are various other coupons as well, from Dominos Store #2878.

Bonus: my wife would be more than happy to draw the subject of your choice in MSPaint!

I never thought I would be in this position, I usually tough out times like these when money is scarce and survive on Ramen and bread.  Alas I don't even have money for that.  Due to my hours at work getting cut (I make minimum wage at a bowling alley) and just having paid rent I'm looking at 2 weeks with no food or Ramen if I'm luckily enough to find some change in the parking lot at work.  

How did I get into this position one might ask, well here is a brief backstory.  I moved out here to Arizona from Ohio to try and get clean from a 7 year hardcore heroin addiction that cost me my own business (I used to own a pizza shop ironically) my girlfriend her life (She overdosed and died in bed next to me last year) and of course I couldn't pay for school while still on drugs and found myself on the streets.  I've worked so hard to finally get a job, albeit its meager and they are doing everything in their power to keep payroll costs as low as possible, and stay clean.  Due to the state being broke I don't qualify for food stamps since I can afford my rent ( although BARELY) that seems to be the biggest deciding factor on whether or not I can get assistance.  I don't have any family as both my father and mother have passed away and both were adopted and had no siblings.  I just don't know what to do and am beyond depressed and fed up with life.  I work so hard and I can't even afford to feed my dog, let alone myself.  I just can't take it anymore, so I finally decided to actually ask reddit for help.  I would give anything just to not be hungry for one night.  If anybody out there is feeling generous, I don't know what I can do in return other than thank you daily for the next few months straight.

I intended on moving to Pennsylvania from Nevada into my grandfathers house, was stated before I left that I'd already have a job at a local grocery store, and that everything was set for me to get there.

So I drive 2700 miles cross country in a car that shouldn't have made it, I spend practically all of my money in doing this.
I get there and everything is fine for about a day.
He decides that I cannot stay at the house when he's gone (I am almost 22), so two or three days after I get there, he has a funeral he has to be at, and me not comfortable going to a funeral of someone I didn't know, don't go. I drive around and drive by a little later and no ones there, so i get out of my car and say fuck it and lay in the front yard, get bored and leave again, 30 minutes later he's back and everythings fine.

The next morning he wakes me up at 10 asking me if I'm going to sleep all day, proceeds trying to get into an argument with me saying i tried to break into his house the day before while he's gone, accusing me of unlocking all his windows and says he knows I tried to break in because he has someone following me around taking pictures. Screaming at me that I'm a liar when I did nothing wrong, and he wants me to leave. So I gather all my shit up and call my uncle. He says I can stay in a run down trailer behind his friends house. 

I'm 2700 miles away from anything or anyone I know staying in a run down trailer, with no money because I spent $300 driving across country, no job because I was lied to, and looking at selling my car to get back home. My uncles broke and can't help me, the people I'm staying at frequently eat out. I have no cash, my cars out of gas, and it basically feels like no one gives a shit. I came trusting my grandfather was trying to help me, and all he did was displace me, break me, lie to me, and insult me. 

I'd just like something to get me through until I get the documents so I can scrap my car to a salvage company ( that I paid 1K for before I left) so I can get a bus ticket back to Nevada. Which should be monday or tuesday depending on how fast my mom gets to the DMV. And before you ask my mom is unemployed and unable to help.
I don't like asking people for help but I love helping others. This will definitely be paid forward as soon as I can.
I'm in the eastern PA area. 
Thanks for any help any one can give, it won't be forgotten and will definitely be paid forward.

TL;DR Moved out to PA from NV, was told I had a job, didn't, grandfather went all schizo on me, now I'm staying in a run down trailer behind my uncles friends house, waiting for the paper work for my car so I can scrap it and go back home.

All we has with us was a skillit, some vegetable oil, and some celebratory Goya Empanadas. Hey, we are college students, eating healthy isn't our forte. 


I put the oil on and asked him to keep an eye on it for me while I ran to the car to look for something. As I was doing that, he got an important phone call from work and forgot about the oil. I came in and the moment i shut the front door the oil spouted into a pillar of flame. Having nothing with us but the clothes on our backs, we had nothing to put out this oil fire with. 


Instead of letting our new home burn my boyfriend decided to bravely pick up the flaming skillit and take it outside. When the front door opened the flames rushed up and licked over his head giving him a few minor burns. This caused him to jerk away and made the burning oil spill all over his right hand.


He had to be skin grafted from his fingertips to his elbows. He has had to wear pressure garments since the burns healed. It is a tight, itchy, and generally uncomfortable skin tight glove and sleeve that has bothered him everyday since. But he just smiles and endures.

Because I'm a man with pride and work ethic, I would like to do some work for you. If you're near or in Reading, I am offering to clean your attic or do some yard work. If you're not near Reading, I will offer my computer skills to you. I can help you with anything Microsoft office related. 

I am not new to Reddit, despite what the bot may say. This is my first and only request. I am seeking to work for a pizza and I hope that this is allowed. I know this is random but please consider me.

My boyfriend doesn't have a job (I do, but I get paid by the month and my first paycheck isn't coming until June 30th).  The only reason he can visit me now is because his brother is taking summer classes so that's half of the traveling cost paid.  He also sprained his ankle on Saturday meaning he's still in crutches.  Lastly (and I realize this one's mostly my fault), my mother really wants us to go with her to Lake Erie for a day and a half.

Yes, I've explained to her about the crutches, that he can't and shouldn't walk very much and that he is not going to be comfortable on this trip.  I've even suggested other alternatives, like going to a free movie in the park.  The thing is, my mother is crazy and you can't argue with crazy.  Also, I'm going to have to tell my BF that apparently, he has to go because if he doesn't, I'm going to be the one getting bitched at about how my boyfriend doesn't care about me and how he's lazy.  I know I should just shake it off and deal with it but honestly, I can't change my situation RIGHT NOW so I'd prefer dealing with this as painlessly as possible.  Of course, my boyfriend seemed pretty pissed about it when I told him my mom suggested this idea so, thanks mom, you're probably going to be the cause of our first fight.

Anyway, it's gonna be a terrible few days for him and I'd like to make sure he has a tasty meal after a long trip and to say ""I'm sorry that my mom's crazy and I can't do anything about it.""  His house is in Oakland so I'd suggest Sorento (4126219129 cheap and decent quality) or Antoons (4126875446 cheaper but more meh pizza) since they are local and cheap.

* Moved out of my dorm, physically exhausting myself by lugging all my physical belongings up three flights of stairs. 

* Learned my grandma has likely-fatal leukemia

* Got rejected.

* Car broke down. Towed for all the money in my checking. Problem not found, magically starts running again.

* Had to miss a week of work due to lack of transportation--less money, more problems

* Discovery that I can't cook well, and I don't have the cash to spend to improve my cooking skills (read: buy a cookbook, or a good square pan, or microwavable dinners).

* My other grandmother, the gentlest woman I will ever meet and the guiding role model in my life, passes away suddenly.

","Hi. These last two weeks have sucked, and I would really appreciate not worrying about one thing--namely, food--after all the torrential bad events I've experienced. In short:

* Moved out of my dorm, physically exhausting myself by lugging all my physical belongings up three flights of stairs. 

* Learned my grandma has likely-fatal leukemia

* Got rejected.

* Car broke down. Towed for all the money in my checking. Problem not found, magically starts running again.

* Had to miss a week of work due to lack of transportation--less money, more problems

* Discovery that I can't cook well, and I don't have the cash to spend to improve my cooking skills (read: buy a cookbook, or a good square pan, or microwavable dinners).

* My other grandmother, the gentlest woman I will ever meet and the guiding role model in my life, passes away suddenly. 

* Car breaks down again. AGAIN. Fortunately, it magically restarts AGAIN, and I don't have to have it towed. But it's almost guaranteed now that whatever is going wrong is going to be expensive.

* I get a sunburn from the funeral, and a mysterious rash from apparently holding a rabbit.

* Grades come back. I am officially beneath the required GPA necessary to keep my scholarship.

Im lonely up here and all my friends and roommates are home for the summer so its just me up here. I recently split from my girlfriend so that isnt helping my situation. I do have a job but im only getting 10 hours a week (even for summer) so im super low on money right now and havent been able to eat out in weeks. I know most posts arent like this or maybe they are im kinda new to this community, but i would greatly appreciate a pizza, even a personal mini one. Anything at all would boost my spirits and hopefully get me out of this funk. Im here to stay and as soon as i can get enough money to buy myself a pizza ill return the favor and reward someone else in much greater need.

I'm currently unemployed as well. I had a bicycle but I had to sell it in order to pay my deposit. My disability check does not come until the 3rd of July and I currently have 20 dollars in cash on me to last until then.
I'm going to go buy some ramen noodles and soup mix once it cools down outside. My lungs are bad and it's stressful for me to walk in this kind of heat.

If anyone would like to donate a pizza to me, it would feed me for 3 or 4 days (I'm not a big eater). I only ever eat pizza when my friends have it, so it would not only feed me, but be a real treat for me as well!

I had a girlfriend live with me, so sharing bills and having food wasn't an issue.

But now that I've been single for a year, and trying to make my way through college, things have been rough. I have depleted any savings I once had, and my credit cards are shot.

I rarely go out with friends because of my situation. I haven't had a beer in ages, and can't remember the last time I ate 3 square meals in a day. I might only have one meal a day, because I have to consciously ration the food and money I have. I even invested in hair-clippers recently, just so I can save money on haircuts.

So here is the situation:
I am requesting pizzafication on behalf of a friend of mine who does not Reddit. She is a young mother, married, and with two children (3 and 1). She recently moved to Glendale, AZ from Florida. She was supposed to be able to stay with an In-Law. That plan fell through due to circumstances outside of her control and she has to vacate her current residence this Friday. She has one other family member in the city that she will be moving in with. She has a job lined up with a call center but doesn't start for 2 months (she has to wait for the next training classes to start). 

**So yes, long term, she will be OK.**

The problem, is that DES hasn't approved her application yet (she has not been in the state long) and she and her husband are skipping eating meals days at a time. Thankfully she is still managing for her children, at the expense of her and her husband eating. I am just looking for a meal to help her get to next week, where I am pretty sure she will be OK (and I will be able to lend further aid at that point if she isn't).

I am requesting pizzafication on behalf of a friend of mine who does not Reddit. She is a young mother, married, and with two children (3 and 1). She recently moved to Glendale, AZ from Florida. She was supposed to be able to stay with an In-Law. That plan fell through due to circumstances outside of her control and she has to vacate her current residence this Friday. She has one other family member in the city that she will be moving in with. She has a job lined up with a call center but doesn't start for 2 months (she has to wait for the next training classes to start). 

**So yes, long term, she will be OK.**

The problem, is that DES hasn't approved her application yet (she has not been in the state long) and she and her husband are skipping eating meals days at a time. Thankfully she is still managing for her children, at the expense of her and her husband eating. I am just looking for a meal to help her get to next week, where I am pretty sure she will be OK (and I will be able to lend further aid at that point if she isn't).

About three months ago, we opened our house to a 19-year-old girl who, along with her mother, made a verbal agreement to pay 1/3rd of the bills in exchange for living in the smaller bedroom. She was very excited and ""needed"" to move out of her mother's house. 

Unfortunately, this girl and her mother conned us for all we had. Being unemployed undergraduate students, we didn't have any money put aside for ""extras"" in the first place, and this girl failed to pay half of her rent for April, all of her rent for June, and all of her rent (plus a late fee!) for July, even after setting up a ""payment plan"" with apartment management with the expectation of paying it. She has since moved out, but not after stealing all of our food, some of our possessions, and most of our dignity. 

Apartment management refuses to accept that this girl still has a legal obligation for her portion of the rent as she has NOT been signed off the lease, and consequently, I have been forced to pay her rent for the last three months. She owes me nearly 700 dollars, and though I have taken her to the DA for the bad check she's written me, there is a high possibility that I will not be able to afford fees for small claims court to claim anything other than the 250 dollar check she wrote me, with intentional fraud. 

She still has two keys to our apartment, so we barricade the door every night because we're afraid she will come back and steal more of our food or belongings. 

Every word this girl has told us is a lie and she has robbed our home of happiness, trust, and most of all, security. We were very nearly evicted last month because of her lies (she waited until the 22nd to ""pay"" her rent and when I'd gone in the next morning to make sure she had, she had not. I was stuck paying it or being evicted.) And now, because of having to pay her rent for the last three months, I may end up evicted within the next few weeks because I do not have enough money to make it. 

My parents have offered to help as much as they can, but frankly, I'm 22 years old and I feel like a loser for living off of my parents when I've been somewhat independent for the last year.

My history is about as bleak: I was homeless over Christmas the last few years, I lived with my sister after that while taking out nearly 10,000 dollars in student loans just for living expenses. The idea that I will be paying off these last three years of my life for the next 50 is sickening to me. I have not been able to go grocery shopping in the last three months; our food reserves are down to nothing because of our roommate's dishonesty and stealing, and we really have no food left. Recently, I was in a vehicle accident that left me with a large gash in my hand and a damaged tendon, and over 1,000 dollars in ER bills which I am unable to pay.

I have applied for assistance and food stamps, but have been denied because I am a student, and my current job which I just picked up at Hometown Buffet (seriously probably the worst job I've ever had) will not consistently give me 20 hours a week, despite having promised me 40 hour weeks when they hired me. This week, I have been awarded six hours of undeniable hell, and yet I have tried to be the best employee I can be because, well, I consider myself lucky I even have a job. 

In August, I may be able to receive food stamps due to being a federal work-study recipient, but that is only if I can find a work-study job, which is very limited. I do not know that my income will continue to support my rent or bills, let alone my boyfriend (who is STILL unemployed, I've come to learn that our town/state both have DOUBLE the unemployment rates of most other towns/states.) and because I am not yet 24, my parents are expected to contribute 10,000 dollars yearly to my education and I may not even be able to attend college because they simply cannot give me that kind of money. As it is, the help they are offering me at the moment is limited and I feel guilty that they even think they can manage to support themselves and me. 

The financial aid and government assistance system simply does not take people like me into account. I try hard, I love fiercely, and I am responsible. I am not getting married to cheat the financial aid system. I am not getting pregnant in order to receive welfare or food stamps or WIC. I am two years away from a Bachelor's degree in a field where I will probably have to relocate thousands of miles away from my hometown simply to find work. I get great grades, I never miss work or a class, and yet... I can't do it on my own. 

Just recently, I've learned that I have diabetes because I have not been able to afford nutritious food or been able to eat more than once a day, causing my insulin production to skyrocket. I spend a large portion of my days, when not working, asleep because high blood sugar levels and hunger cause me to feel incredibly weak. I don't have medical insurance to help me through this at the moment, because the Medi-cal budget is being cut and my paperwork is still in the processing stage following my accident last month. 

It is the first of July, and I know someone who is diabetic should not be asking for pizza, but dammit, I'm hungry and my boyfriend's birthday was two days ago, and I haven't been able to give him anything. I don't know what I can offer in prove aside from pictures of my puppy-dog stare, empty pantry, and medical bills, but really, I just want a freakin' pizza and the inevitable food-coma that will come afterwards. 

With vegetables on it. I've learned, as a child you never want to eat your vegetables, as an adult who cant afford food, you miss them more than anything. 

By the way: this website gives me so much hope, I could burst. I spent hours yesterday and today reading posts before I even signed up for a name and got the balls to make one myself. &lt;3

In August, I may be able to receive food stamps due to being a federal work-study recipient, but that is only if I can find a work-study job, which is very limited. I do not know that my income will continue to support my rent or bills, let alone my boyfriend (who is STILL unemployed, I've come to learn that our town/state both have DOUBLE the unemployment rates of most other towns/states.) and because I am not yet 24, my parents are expected to contribute 10,000 dollars yearly to my education and I may not even be able to attend college because they simply cannot give me that kind of money. As it is, the help they are offering me at the moment is limited and I feel guilty that they even think they can manage to support themselves and me. 

The financial aid and government assistance system simply does not take people like me into account. I try hard, I love fiercely, and I am responsible. I am not getting married to cheat the financial aid system. I am not getting pregnant in order to receive welfare or food stamps or WIC. I am two years away from a Bachelor's degree in a field where I will probably have to relocate thousands of miles away from my hometown simply to find work. I get great grades, I never miss work or a class, and yet... I can't do it on my own. 

Just recently, I've learned that I have diabetes because I have not been able to afford nutritious food or been able to eat more than once a day, causing my insulin production to skyrocket. I spend a large portion of my days, when not working, asleep because high blood sugar levels and hunger cause me to feel incredibly weak. I don't have medical insurance to help me through this at the moment, because the Medi-cal budget is being cut and my paperwork is still in the processing stage following my accident last month. 

It is the first of July, and I know someone who is diabetic should not be asking for pizza, but dammit, I'm hungry and my boyfriend's birthday was two days ago, and I haven't been able to give him anything. I don't know what I can offer in prove aside from pictures of my puppy-dog stare, empty pantry, and medical bills, but really, I just want a freakin' pizza and the inevitable food-coma that will come afterwards. 

With vegetables on it. I've learned, as a child you never want to eat your vegetables, as an adult who cant afford food, you miss them more than anything. 

By the way: this website gives me so much hope, I could burst. I spent hours yesterday and today reading posts before I even signed up for a name and got the balls to make one myself. &lt;3

Our cabinets/fridge are basically bare, other than spices and seasoning. We used up the last of our leftovers yesterday, and now we're down to bread, peanut butter, and water. And we've had a LOT of peanut butter, bread, and water lately. I hate to ask, but we literally don't even have a dollar until that money shows up.

If anyone wanted to send us a pizza or two, that'd be amazing. Signed up for a verification code just in case ;). We'd be more than willing to send you pizza(s) back when our transfer goes through, pay it forward to some other person here in need, or provide any variety of services as part of the agreement.

t3_pzdct,N/A,False,2,2,True,6,"**EDIT** I am situated here in Atlanta, Georgia. Sorry for not posting the state in the title guys.

If this sub is anything like the rest of Reddit I might get a little sympathy for being a total idiot my entire life. To make a long story short I was born in Salt Lake so I was branded LDS from conception. My 21st birthday party was a trip to temple to hear president Hinckley (our ""Prophet"" at the time) speak about family. Even then I thought that was a lousy birthday. Up until yesterday I held priesthood in the church and was a key toting, card carrying member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

That is no longer the case, I got up in the middle of sacrament on Sunday, and, after a less than friendly chat with our Bishop yesterday, I am officially done with religion. I've been on the ropes for years but the cowpies just got stacked one too high lately. So I've had enough. If God exists he certainly doesn't look well upon the LDS followings. You know how much garbage I caught for buying a cup of coffee on Sunday? Way too much. For one thing caffeine is a no no but another lesser known of my former beliefs is we're not supposed to do anything business related on the Sabbath day. No dining out, no work, no grocery shopping, etc. And the fact that I bought something turned almost the whole congregation on me. That was some good coffee too.

So basically I've spent 28 years trying hard to believe in something, spent 2 years in Japan trying to make other people believe it with me, and now I'm pretty much alone because of my refusal to believe in the most ridiculous things our church kept pushing on me. I got 2 friends who aren't LDS, the others won't stick with me after renouncing their religion so I'm in the market for new friends to boot lol.

If you have any questions about the spooky and mysterious world of Mormonism ask away. And if you could spare some dinner for a guy who's tax check hasn't arrived yet you'd have my blessing and gratitude. And no, not a religious kind of blessing.

You don't need to do this, but I'd appreciate it. (Plus, I can surprise the fianceé with her half to lessen the blow.  She knows, incidentally.)

Sorry to bother.

**Edit** ... Sorry again. I'm in Ontario, Canada. I'm new to this. Sorry.

**UPDATE**  I didn't get pizza last night. User ""shockey"" helped out (I believe, because my faith in humanity can't let me think that this was a prank) to the point of taking my personal info, but no pizza came.  Around 11pm last night, I noticed that they deleted their user info from Reddit, but tried to ignore the warning flags that come with that.

[Conversation, part 1](http://imgur.com/QkDp5.jpg) and [part 2.](http://imgur.com/ktmYJ.jpg)

Sorry, everyone, for getting your hopes up. I don't know what my fianceé ate last night. It's nearly 5am for me now, so I'll go eat some cereal and make a coffee, and start the day. ~~I'll message the mods here about this~~ (Nope, I have no info and it was only my trust), but only time will tell if we were scammed or not. I hope not.  I sincerely think that it was a first-time gesture that didn't go through.

I really don't mean to bother anyone, and thanks for the words and support you gave. 

**UPDATE 2** Hello, again. Thanks to everyone who messaged their support and well-wishes.

Although we never received pizza from *Random Acts of Pizza*, which has an obstacle regarding cross-border exchanges it seems, it should be noted that *we did have pizza* last night from some old friends of ours who invited us back to our hometown.  It was a great night out and all of us got some great laughs and good social vibes.

*(The first* ""boy pizza"" *had pepperoni, bacon, tomato, and red pepper; the second* ""girl pizza"" *was feta cheese, sundried tomato, red onion, and green olives.  There was also 20 deep-fried wings, ordered with BBQ sauce but supplemented with the home's own Frank Sauce. A jug of Nestle Ice Tea Zero was offered and shared all around.)*

I just want to thank everyone who has offered to assist my fianceé and I in the last few days. She's as astounded and overjoyed at this post as I am, and we thank you all sincerely.  She also keeps nudging me to start accepting some of the gratuity, Since I was fence-sitting because of my morality, ethics, and humility, I've decided to graciously accept a few offers (if still available) via private message. If declined, I fully understand with no ill will.

Once again, thank you, everyone.  You are an awesome community, and we love you.

**TL;DR** Laid off, pizza offer fell through in possible scam (though hopefully not), Reddit comes through with offers and consolation, we get pizza from friends back home.

So I heard you can request pizza here, well I just bought $200 worth of groceries yesterday so I'm good. I wanna repay a favor to a friend I've known for a very short time, but he's done a lot for me in that time.

I lost my job a while back and started posting up my stuff for sale online. He's been a godsend to me, he's bought stuff from me on multiple occasions and helped me eat when I wouldn't have been able to otherwise. He lives an hour away and he travels down here to buy from me and even takes me to the grocery store so I don't have to waste money on a cab! I've known the guy less than 2 months and he's already been more awesome than anyone else has been to me in probably my whole life.

He's been sweating some bills due this week, but even though he was strapped he helped me out big time earlier this week. I had to notarize my I-9 for my new job and get my driver's license renewed. He spent 5 hours on Tuesday not only taking me to the DMV and the notary, but he did it with money out of his own pocket. I tried to pay him back yesterday but he wouldn't let me, he said he did it out of friendship. The mans struggling to pay his bills this week and he helped make sure I could get back on my feet at long last, now that's a friend.

He's got 2 kids under the age of 7 he's in his late fifties no less, so the man is definitely a warrior in my mind. I won't start getting paid for a few more weeks, but he's had it rough the past few days and still put me before himself. I wanna thank him but I had to buy three weeks worth of food yesterday in one sitting, plus pay for the cab ride, so I'm  fresh out of dough. It never even crossed my mind to send him a pizza until I wandered on here. He can't very well turn down dinner when it arrives at his door free of charge, so that's what I wanna do.

Anyone think they can spot me a gift card so I can send him some dinner tonight or tomorrow? He's been awesome to me these past few months, he even overpaid me for some of the things he bought because he knew I needed the money. This would be a small drop in the bucket but I wanna pay him back for some of his kindness at least. I don't mind coming back in three weeks and returning the favor, I'm gonna be set making 14 an hour at this job, but he could use this right now, I know he could. So pretty please, will someone help me make this man's day?

My family and I are in dire need, and I just don't know what to do anymore. I've been homeless before, and had to do without, but I'm struggling at my last wits to hold on this time.


I just can't let my children go through that, and by the grace of God, a blessing will come. You see, I've spent my last just so my kids could eat something; no cash, no savings, no credit, nothing. I've applied for food stamps, but it will be nearly a week before we receive them. So, in the meantime, I don't know what we're going to do. I don't have a car or any transportation, for that matter, so I can't get to a food bank or pantry. Believe me, I've thought about it, but I'm literally stranded. We have no family out here.


My husband is out of work due to injury, and I've been out of work due to my health. We have been trying to make it by doing work for people online, like building websites, writing articles, building backlinks, and so on. It's been tough, however, because for every legit job we get, it seems someone else tries to get over on us. For the sake of our children, though, we push on.


I don't want to go into all the details publicly, but it's really hard for us these days. We're barely scraping by. We're just a day or two away from homelessness (you can PM for more info), and what's worse is that we can't get any help. We've tried, and been turned away. It's sad. When you need help, I mean really need it, you can't get it.


For the past couple of days, we've only had enough food for the kids to eat, so we've gone without. As long as they have what they need, we will be okay. They are what matters most to us, and so, we sacrifice for them. We don't get much sleep for worrying and trying to make enough money just to get by. Between the stress and worry, I'm surprised that we can even hold a thought.


I cry sometimes, a lot actually, and I wonder, if our efforts are in vain. It seems like everything is working against us, no matter how hard we push forward, we just can't stay ahead. It's wearing me down, that's for sure, but I know that our breakthrough is coming. Somehow, and someway, we are going to make it.


It's just so tiring to try, and try, and try, and not get anywhere. And what I've told you here is not the half of it. If anyone can help, I will give you the info (verification) that you need of our situation.


I'm just hoping, that at least tonight, someone can help us out. Pizza isn't much, but it's something. And I'll be thankful for it. It will help us to get through another tough night, just a little easier.

My fridge has hardly anything in it (I can show you this too!) and basically, a pizza would be a life saver tonight. It's been a rough Monday so far.
