N/A,False,0,7,False,12,"Hi Everyone!

First time requester here and thanks for reading. I'd like to request a pizza for my partner of 7 years. I think it'd be a really nice surprise for him and he loves Reddit as much as I do, so it'd give him one heck of a smile. If you're interested, I want to provide some history so you know where I'm coming from and why I'd like to see that smile. I'll try to provide enough context without being too verbose :)

About 3 years ago I lost my job in marketing. I was the breadwinner in the relationship and he worked for fun, really. I set out to find another job at the start of the recession and it didn't go so well.

After about a year of being unemployed, living off savings and looking for another job that would pay enough for me to pay my bills (a big concern that stopped me from taking a lot of jobs due to pay requirements... we all have to service our debt obligations!)  I realized I hated what I was doing. I was 25 then... 2 years ago. 

It's strange and hard to describe, I think, unless you've gone through something similar. I worked hard, ever since I was 13 and had a paper route that earned me a couple hundred a month. When I was 16 I got a job at Best Buy and that's when my 'career' in sales took off. I sold on the Best Buy floor for about a year, then went to CompUSA where I worked as a commissioned sales guy. My first commission job and I was only 17. I made really good money and continued to progress through retail and then into retail marketing. 

By the time I was entering college I was making more than most people who had been out of college for years, and that number went up every year. That kind of money blinded me to the fact that I wasn't enjoying what I was doing... I was enjoying making and spending money. So much so that I burned through it faster than I made it. It was really the only thing I had fun doing, though. I dropped out of college (probably a good thing, since I was going for a degree I wouldn't want now).

I met my partner through Myspace at about the time I had gotten my first management position and was traveling 90% of the time. The first couple years were great. I was gone so much it was like a long honeymoon. Sometimes he'd come with me; Vegas, NYC, Seattle... etc. 

For his part he worked off and on. It was never a big deal... I made a lot more money than him. He'd always worked odd retail jobs, hourly stuff, customer service stuff. Never made over $10 an hour or held a job for more than half a year. I didn't care because I'd rather spend my time with him when I was home than have him working and making a couple extra bucks.

So, back to three years ago when I lost my job. After about a year of coming up dry, I fell into a pretty bad depression. I couldn't find work that would pay my bills, and realized that I didn't even like doing that work. It affected our relationship dramatically. I retreated into World of Warcraft and stopped talking to family. Eventually the money ran out and bills stopped getting paid. 

I hit bottom after a long, dark period... but thankfully for me bottom was a nice soft pillow of people that loved me. My parents stepped in to help get me through some tough financials and my partner stepped up to support me mentally and financially. 

Fast forward to today. My partner is now happily employed (1 year anniversary this month) with a company that is providing him with a promising career opportunity that he loves doing. We've downsized our lives; no car, eating cheap, staying in, cooking and we've moved into a studio apartment. My partner is working we're saving so I can go to school and do something that I do love; be a vet. He even got me a chocolate Labrador puppy in February. We named him Fizban and he's a constant source of joy for me. The person I was 3 years ago would not recognize the person I am today.

I try to do nice things for him whenever possible to lessen the stress of being the sole earner in the house. That's what this request is about. We're not starving, but we live tight. This would not only be a delicious treat for us, but once my partner found out that it came from a generous person on Reddit he will be amazed.

One day I promise to pay it forward. Here's a picture of my dog, Fizban and my partner:  http://imgur.com/SoygY","Hi Everyone!

N/A,False,10,45,False,27,"Hello, people. 

I was just told about this subreddit by a friend after venting to him about this evenings biggest annoyance. I've taken part in pizza sharing things before, I just honestly never knew there was a subreddit for it. My favourite time anything like that happened was this one time me and a friend spent _forever_ calling anywhere we could find in this small Czech town, trying to order pizza for a mutual friend we knew online, but that's a long and HILARIOUS tale involving calling the _Mayor_ even, and I'll gladly share it if folk want to hear it.

Anyway, my issue, sob story, whatever you wanna call it.

Basically I live with a flatmate in a really crappy part of the northwest UK, and this guy I share my space with is a presumptuous ass. It's not uncommon to find he's 'borrowed' something of mine, not cleaned after himself if he used the kitchen/bathroom/toilet/anything, and a favourite trick of his seems to be eating my food when he thinks I'm not in or asleep. 
That happened tonight. I come in from a day out with family and open the fridge, I'd been planning on making a veritable bathtub full of chilli to eat and freeze in for the next few days until my payday, however tonight I get to learn that he's had company over and guess what he made for these upstanding citizens! He basically used _everything_ I had left, _everything_, to feed his drugdealer friends as they came over to smoke weed, be loud, and play/watch whatever happens to be ridiculously loud in the next room over. One pointless shouting match later I'm sat here tired, wet, and hungry enough that I'd happily eat my bed. Spoke with the family I _just_ came from about this and I'm invited back over for dinner on Friday, the day prior to my payday. Still leaves me foodless tonight and tomorrow, though, and a friend pointed me here. I already said that. Um.

I was just told about this subreddit by a friend after venting to him about this evenings biggest annoyance. I've taken part in pizza sharing things before, I just honestly never knew there was a subreddit for it. My favourite time anything like that happened was this one time me and a friend spent _forever_ calling anywhere we could find in this small Czech town, trying to order pizza for a mutual friend we knew online, but that's a long and HILARIOUS tale involving calling the _Mayor_ even, and I'll gladly share it if folk want to hear it.

Anyway, my issue, sob story, whatever you wanna call it.

Basically I live with a flatmate in a really crappy part of the northwest UK, and this guy I share my space with is a presumptuous ass. It's not uncommon to find he's 'borrowed' something of mine, not cleaned after himself if he used the kitchen/bathroom/toilet/anything, and a favourite trick of his seems to be eating my food when he thinks I'm not in or asleep. 
That happened tonight. I come in from a day out with family and open the fridge, I'd been planning on making a veritable bathtub full of chilli to eat and freeze in for the next few days until my payday, however tonight I get to learn that he's had company over and guess what he made for these upstanding citizens! He basically used _everything_ I had left, _everything_, to feed his drugdealer friends as they came over to smoke weed, be loud, and play/watch whatever happens to be ridiculously loud in the next room over. One pointless shouting match later I'm sat here tired, wet, and hungry enough that I'd happily eat my bed.

My boyfriend and I decided to move into this awesome house because he's going back to school and it makes his commute significantly shorter.  Our new landlord is awesome and told us, since the house is already empty, we could start moving our stuff a couple weeks early so that it makes our move easier, awesome right?

So then, last night as I'm cleaning our place and getting ready for the move, our current landlord rings our doorbell.  She tells me that they are ""resealing"" our road tomorrow and that the road will be completely closed to our driveway from 6AM-6PM.

It's been a difficult couple months for my boyfriend (22M) and I (23F).  He is currently unemployed and looking for a job, and I am self employed, but all my income has been needed to cover our bills while my boyfriend has been out of work, so there is absolutely nothing left.  I spent the whole afternoon trying to get local assistance to put some money on our M-Power card (a pay-as-you-go program for electricity here in Phoenix Arizona) to NO AVAIL : ( all our local agencies are either full for appointments or not assisting those without children in the home.  So we are keeping our apartment dark and very warm (it's currently 108 degrees outside!) having to be extremely cautious with any ac use as our electric is about to run out.  My boyfriend ran around today using the very last of our gas going to job interviews and the required drug testing.  We could really just use a filling dinner so we can collect our thoughts and regroup since we need all the energy we can get to figure out a way to cover our very basic needs until we get more income.  There are no groceries here, I actually used the last of what we had here (some vegetables, rice, and tuna) to feed our two dogs.  Of course we would be incredibly grateful with any form of help from anybody.  A Pizza Hut gift card would be amazing, and any other help as well.  I do understand there are other subreddits for assistance also and I will look into those guidelines to see if it is appropriate for me to post there too.  

In exchange for any help someone can give I would like to make you a small beaded item.  I could do a brooch or a pendant with seed beads, crystal, felt, some semi precious gem beads I have here.  You could tell me what colors you like and I could make something for you or a loved one.  I am open to suggestions.  Included are examples of what I can do.

It will be catchy, awesome, and recorded in the form of a high quality mp3, in exchange for a delicious ham and pineapple pizza. I'll even submit it to you before you send a pizza, if you're wary about the deal.

Here's the deal: I'm 22, and I live with my mom. We've been going through some pretty rough times as of late -- we're knee deep in debt, going through a foreclosure on our home, and we've been living paycheck to paycheck for months on end. Mom works part-time at a hospital, and I've been looking for work for quite awhile, but as of yet nothing's come up. We've been living on what food my mom can get from her work (employees can get food in exchange for 'payroll reduction', where they take the charges right out of their paycheck), but this week's pay cycle just ran out, meaning we can't get any more food there until this coming week. Groceries haven't been a realistic possibility with our income lately, so until then, we're out of luck (and food) this weekend. We've got twenty dollars in the bank to cover gas, but that's about it.

In addition to all of this, my mom suffers from a myriad of health issues, so between that and all of the stress from our financial situation, she feels absolutely miserable. I'm hoping that maybe some delicious pizza would at least take her mind off things and brighten up her day a bit.  Again, I feel awful asking for help,  but any at all would be greatly appreciated, and when we can afford it, we will definitely be able donate a pizza or two here.

I couldn't believe it.

I haven't entirely looked through other requests as I'm pretty sure I'm not the only hungry person in the world, but tbh after I read the sidebar I immediately grabbed my camera and made a ""REQUEST"" because I'm hungry.

The embarrassing part is asking for food on the internet- forget that,

[1] Food going bad, fridge practically empty  
[2] Ice-cream I bought gone bad, this is after I knew my refrigerator started trolling  
[3] I'm not starving I have lots of bread, but as you can see I can't stand it, at least for today.  

I give my praise to anyone that fulfills my request.   
When I get the money I'm seriously giving back a redditor a free pizza.   
Located in GA

**update:** being able to get free pizza from a fellow redditor I don't even know is unreal  
I feel terribly bad, I just found out about this sub-reddit and within 3 hours a redditor gives me a pizza

About three months ago, we opened our house to a 19-year-old girl who, along with her mother, made a verbal agreement to pay 1/3rd of the bills in exchange for living in the smaller bedroom. She was very excited and ""needed"" to move out of her mother's house. 

Unfortunately, this girl and her mother conned us for all we had. Being unemployed undergraduate students, we didn't have any money put aside for ""extras"" in the first place, and this girl failed to pay half of her rent for April, all of her rent for June, and all of her rent (plus a late fee!) for July, even after setting up a ""payment plan"" with apartment management with the expectation of paying it. She has since moved out, but not after stealing all of our food, some of our possessions, and most of our dignity. 

Apartment management refuses to accept that this girl still has a legal obligation for her portion of the rent as she has NOT been signed off the lease, and consequently, I have been forced to pay her rent for the last three months. She owes me nearly 700 dollars, and though I have taken her to the DA for the bad check she's written me, there is a high possibility that I will not be able to afford fees for small claims court to claim anything other than the 250 dollar check she wrote me, with intentional fraud. 

She still has two keys to our apartment, so we barricade the door every night because we're afraid she will come back and steal more of our food or belongings. 

Every word this girl has told us is a lie and she has robbed our home of happiness, trust, and most of all, security. We were very nearly evicted last month because of her lies (she waited until the 22nd to ""pay"" her rent and when I'd gone in the next morning to make sure she had, she had not. I was stuck paying it or being evicted.) And now, because of having to pay her rent for the last three months, I may end up evicted within the next few weeks because I do not have enough money to make it. 

My parents have offered to help as much as they can, but frankly, I'm 22 years old and I feel like a loser for living off of my parents when I've been somewhat independent for the last year.

My history is about as bleak: I was homeless over Christmas the last few years, I lived with my sister after that while taking out nearly 10,000 dollars in student loans just for living expenses. The idea that I will be paying off these last three years of my life for the next 50 is sickening to me. I have not been able to go grocery shopping in the last three months; our food reserves are down to nothing because of our roommate's dishonesty and stealing, and we really have no food left. Recently, I was in a vehicle accident that left me with a large gash in my hand and a damaged tendon, and over 1,000 dollars in ER bills which I am unable to pay.

I have applied for assistance and food stamps, but have been denied because I am a student, and my current job which I just picked up at Hometown Buffet (seriously probably the worst job I've ever had) will not consistently give me 20 hours a week, despite having promised me 40 hour weeks when they hired me. This week, I have been awarded six hours of undeniable hell, and yet I have tried to be the best employee I can be because, well, I consider myself lucky I even have a job. 

In August, I may be able to receive food stamps due to being a federal work-study recipient, but that is only if I can find a work-study job, which is very limited. I do not know that my income will continue to support my rent or bills, let alone my boyfriend (who is STILL unemployed, I've come to learn that our town/state both have DOUBLE the unemployment rates of most other towns/states.) and because I am not yet 24, my parents are expected to contribute 10,000 dollars yearly to my education and I may not even be able to attend college because they simply cannot give me that kind of money. As it is, the help they are offering me at the moment is limited and I feel guilty that they even think they can manage to support themselves and me. 

The financial aid and government assistance system simply does not take people like me into account. I try hard, I love fiercely, and I am responsible. I am not getting married to cheat the financial aid system. I am not getting pregnant in order to receive welfare or food stamps or WIC. I am two years away from a Bachelor's degree in a field where I will probably have to relocate thousands of miles away from my hometown simply to find work. I get great grades, I never miss work or a class, and yet... I can't do it on my own. 

Just recently, I've learned that I have diabetes because I have not been able to afford nutritious food or been able to eat more than once a day, causing my insulin production to skyrocket. I spend a large portion of my days, when not working, asleep because high blood sugar levels and hunger cause me to feel incredibly weak. I don't have medical insurance to help me through this at the moment, because the Medi-cal budget is being cut and my paperwork is still in the processing stage following my accident last month. 

It is the first of July, and I know someone who is diabetic should not be asking for pizza, but dammit, I'm hungry and my boyfriend's birthday was two days ago, and I haven't been able to give him anything. I don't know what I can offer in prove aside from pictures of my puppy-dog stare, empty pantry, and medical bills, but really, I just want a freakin' pizza and the inevitable food-coma that will come afterwards. 

With vegetables on it. I've learned, as a child you never want to eat your vegetables, as an adult who cant afford food, you miss them more than anything.

But, I also want to be honest. Know that I am happy (pizza or not)! With that disclaimer out of the way, here is sort of what is happening in my life, cliff-note style.

-I am poor in the college-student sort of way. My parents are broke, so I worked my way through college working for AT&amp;T 40 hours a week.

-I did well in college

-Upon graduating, I received a US government grant to move to Taiwan for a year.

-Yay!

-However, there was a six month gap between college and moving to Taiwan, one that was really hard to fill with employment. So, we are pretty broke.

-The last few weeks of my life have been insane. Applying for visas, passports, getting medical clearances, seeing every doctor in town, selling my car, buying a new wardrobe, packing or selling everything I own... you get the idea. My GF and I have been waking up, scrambling all day, and going back to bed. We are exhausted and broke.

-I am leaving to Taiwan in 4 days, and I still have so much to do that it's quite upsetting.

-From what I understand, the pizza situation in Taiwan is quite depressing :(

So, I ask for some help for my GF and I, one last chance to eat some pizza before we move on into the unknown (and one less thing to have to figure out tonight as we continue packing).

I had always read about this sub-reddit, but never participated. I always figured that if I did, I would be giving away a pizza. But, at the moment, it seems life put me in the position of the requester.

Pizza or not, I think this is a really cool subreddit, and I am super excited to be moving abroad, despite all the stress involved with preparing.

Thanks for listening, and I can't wait until I am in a position to be the pizza giver.

EDIT: Sorry, I am in the Atlanta, GA area. I just re-read the info site and noticed I missed this bit.

What is competitive Gaming? Competitive Gaming, or eSports, is a growing industry that has received a huge boom in viewership over the last few years with the advent of new Internet streaming services. Professionals on teams get paid to play games like /r/starcraft /r/leagueoflegends /r/DotA2 at the highest caliber. They battle it out in [tournaments](http://www.dota2.com/international/announcement/) for millions of dollars year round.  

Millions of people watch this content every week. However we do not have sponsorship money coming in from Coke, Honda, Mcdonalds, or other mainstream companies. Papa John's is a serious contender in an effort to get more lifestyle sponsors into our growing industry. This is their first major fore into our industry. They are dipping their toes in. We want to blow their expectations away.

All we has with us was a skillit, some vegetable oil, and some celebratory Goya Empanadas. Hey, we are college students, eating healthy isn't our forte. 


I put the oil on and asked him to keep an eye on it for me while I ran to the car to look for something. As I was doing that, he got an important phone call from work and forgot about the oil. I came in and the moment i shut the front door the oil spouted into a pillar of flame. Having nothing with us but the clothes on our backs, we had nothing to put out this oil fire with. 


Instead of letting our new home burn my boyfriend decided to bravely pick up the flaming skillit and take it outside. When the front door opened the flames rushed up and licked over his head giving him a few minor burns. This caused him to jerk away and made the burning oil spill all over his right hand.


He had to be skin grafted from his fingertips to his elbows. He has had to wear pressure garments since the burns healed. It is a tight, itchy, and generally uncomfortable skin tight glove and sleeve that has bothered him everyday since. But he just smiles and endures.


He just called me to say that the doctor told him he didn't need to wear his pressure garments anymore! I want to celebrate with him with a pizza, but money is tight given the medical bills.

I never thought I would be in this position, I usually tough out times like these when money is scarce and survive on Ramen and bread.  Alas I don't even have money for that.  Due to my hours at work getting cut (I make minimum wage at a bowling alley) and just having paid rent I'm looking at 2 weeks with no food or Ramen if I'm luckily enough to find some change in the parking lot at work.  

How did I get into this position one might ask, well here is a brief backstory.  I moved out here to Arizona from Ohio to try and get clean from a 7 year hardcore heroin addiction that cost me my own business (I used to own a pizza shop ironically) my girlfriend her life (She overdosed and died in bed next to me last year) and of course I couldn't pay for school while still on drugs and found myself on the streets.  I've worked so hard to finally get a job, albeit its meager and they are doing everything in their power to keep payroll costs as low as possible, and stay clean.  Due to the state being broke I don't qualify for food stamps since I can afford my rent ( although BARELY) that seems to be the biggest deciding factor on whether or not I can get assistance.  I don't have any family as both my father and mother have passed away and both were adopted and had no siblings.  I just don't know what to do and am beyond depressed and fed up with life.  I work so hard and I can't even afford to feed my dog, let alone myself.  I just can't take it anymore, so I finally decided to actually ask reddit for help.  I would give anything just to not be hungry for one night.  If anybody out there is feeling generous, I don't know what I can do in return other than thank you daily for the next few months straight.

Also, I promise I will pay it forward. When I get paid on Friday, I solomly swear that the first thing I'll do is pizza someone else in need.

Thank you!

I know I'm new on here, but I have been a long time member on other web sites like Slickdeals.net, which showed me how to save money on groceries thru Amazon.

I am hitting up a temp agency today to see if I can find an immediate solution to my money quandaries. If I am successful in supplementing my income, I will gladly return to do my part in keeping the wheel of Pizza graciousness spinning. My birthday is coming up on the 14th of July, and I have always felt more comfortable with giving than receiving on my special day. Like a hobbit.

I went into work and was called into the office of the Manager who runs the whole establishment, mind you I've never even spoken to the man. He begins grilling me about some sensitive information I had leaked and wants to know how I found out. I have two choices, give him a name, or be fired.

What was the information? Well I asked the sous chef's mother how her daughter was doing after not getting the job. Apparently no one knew she hadn't gotten it yet somehow I did.

How did I find this information out? A random conversation with a co-worker about who the new chef is going to be.

Nothing fishy in the whole thing. I was going through my day-to-day work life without a care in the world and bam, I'm in my boss's, boss's, boss's office under the microscope being pushed for a name and I couldn't for the life of me remember who told me what seemed to be such trivial information. So just like that I got the hammer.

I somehow took the news alright. I mean, I was definitely plotting my revenge on ""the man"" and making plans to build my own corporation that would ravage their puny establishment until it begged to be put out of it's misery, but my head was up and my spirits were high.

I drove out of the parking lot and hit the job hunt immediately. Which lasted all of about 30 minutes when it ended abruptly and I found myself underneath a 2006 Dodge Charger. 

The driver, not wanting to waste the precious moments of their ever important life, decided to skip the traffic at a stop light by driving up the shoulder and wound up directly on top of me, totaling my bike.

So now we're at the present moment. I'm on my 5th day of leg elevated bed lock down, the bills are still coming in, and the hunger is rumbling. I heard about this subreddit and thought I'd give it a shot. Even if I there's no pizza to be had it was nice to tell the story. I hope you enjoyed it and thanks in advance for filling a crippled mans tummy! hahaha","So I had a phenomenal day on Friday, I have to tell you all about it. 

I went into work and was called into the office of the Manager who runs the whole establishment, mind you I've never even spoken to the man. He begins grilling me about some sensitive information I had leaked and wants to know how I found out. I have two choices, give him a name, or be fired.

What was the information? Well I asked the sous chef's mother how her daughter was doing after not getting the job. Apparently no one knew she hadn't gotten it yet somehow I did.

How did I find this information out? A random conversation with a co-worker about who the new chef is going to be.

Nothing fishy in the whole thing. I was going through my day-to-day work life without a care in the world and bam, I'm in my boss's, boss's, boss's office under the microscope being pushed for a name and I couldn't for the life of me remember who told me what seemed to be such trivial information. So just like that I got the hammer.

Hi there. I'm a 22 year old male who has recently moved. Since moving, I've lost a friend, been mugged at gunpoint, had to replace an alternator, and now I have to replace the struts my car. In fact, it should have been finished a week ago but due to some reasons I'm unaware of it seems that the mechanic I hired has cancelled on me three times and wont even answer the phone at this point. He even has the parts that I paid for sitting on his property. I simply don't have the know how to do so, or I'd do it myself.

As far as losing a friend goes, someone had a change in plans regarding my living situation. I was to stay with her for a few weeks while I found another place. She told me to find a new place pretty much immediately and that I was acting like a child, ect. I wasn't even there half of the time, so I honestly do not know why she went so crazy. It kind of hurt to see her suddenly change like that, since we were friends for so long.

In any case, it's getting pretty rough here lately. I can't leave this end of town for any reason due to my car problems so grocery runs are limited, too. I'm lucky enough to work really close to where I live, so there is limited strain on the car in its [current state](http://i.imgur.com/Z5sdP.jpg). (The strut has recently fallen completely off.)

In fact, it should have been finished a week ago but due to some reasons I'm unaware of it seems that the mechanic I hired has cancelled on me three times and wont even answer the phone at this point. He even has the parts that I paid for sitting on his property. I simply don't have the know how to do so, or I'd do it myself.

As far as losing a friend goes, someone had a change in plans regarding my living situation. I was to stay with her for a few weeks while I found another place. She told me to find a new place pretty much immediately and that I was acting like a child, ect. I wasn't even there half of the time, so I honestly do not know why she went so crazy. It kind of hurt to see her suddenly change like that, since we were friends for so long.

In any case, it's getting pretty rough here lately. I can't leave this end of town for any reason due to my car problems so grocery runs are limited, too. I'm lucky enough to work really close to where I live, so there is limited strain on the car in its [current state](http://i.imgur.com/Z5sdP.jpg). (The strut has recently fallen completely off.)

**EDIT:  I withdraw my request for a pizza.  There's others that deserve it more.  The fact that I was paid for a job that I was horrible at does make me feel like I shouldn't be asking for a pizza.  My family and I will be fine.  i appreciate all the offers.  **

**I ask that if you really were going to get me a pizza today, you instead get one for ""halohoppe"".  He obviously has such low opinions of majority of humanity that I think everyone would be better off if his faith was restored slightly.
I'll admit I was upset when he posted twice about what a scumbag I am, and how I just like free shit, but he's right.  I do like free shit, and I was paid to be in a job that i was not fit for.  i had other duties and continued to work, and had a great boss who was more of a friend.  I have no reason to feel sorry for myself..  Please, get a pizza for halohoppe.

My request? This girl is obsessed with Margarita Pizza and Pizza in general...she eats it everyday. She didn't come in with any today though. I'm guessing it's because she just got married with no party and miiiiiight be a little sad about it.

I don't know why they didn't have a ceremony as I'm afraid to bring it up.

* Got rejected.

* Car broke down. Towed for all the money in my checking. Problem not found, magically starts running again.

* Had to miss a week of work due to lack of transportation--less money, more problems

* Discovery that I can't cook well, and I don't have the cash to spend to improve my cooking skills (read: buy a cookbook, or a good square pan, or microwavable dinners).

* My other grandmother, the gentlest woman I will ever meet and the guiding role model in my life, passes away suddenly. 

* Car breaks down again. AGAIN. Fortunately, it magically restarts AGAIN, and I don't have to have it towed. But it's almost guaranteed now that whatever is going wrong is going to be expensive.

Here's the sitch (is that how you abbreviate it? I know how it's said, but I don't think I've seen it in writing....)

My girlfriend has been working hard to support us since I lost my job. Long hours, crappy boss, you know the drill. 

About an hour ago I just got a short gig, so I can start to contribute again, but it will still be a while before we're back on our feet completely.

As I feel it is my boyfriendly duty, the least I can do for everything she does, I give her a lot of massages. Back, neck, arms, feet, I do it all baby! I'm rubbing those knots out like nobody's business.

But now my hands remind me of my grandpa's (except the skin doesn't look paper thin). Knuckles the size of cherries, stiff as a board. Ok so that's quite an exaggeration, they don't really hurt. But still.

I would love to be able to have a pizza tonight with her, as a sort of thank you type date thing, since we don't always get to eat together and it's never something you find on /r/FoodPorn

I am currently living with a roommate who has just moved out of her mother's house, she has no job and her mother sends her utility and rent money. Her only responsibility is to send her mom the rent bill, and she sends half of that or pays half to the company. The problem is that this girl is SO lazy, can't be bothered to send the bills, can't be bothered to call her mom for rent and I'm under the impression she told her mom she already had a job (her mom has been chiding her for not having a job), so her mother does not feel obligated to pay this girl's bills. I have been carrying the weight of the major bills, such as electricity and rent (2x), and my paycheck is being stretched thin. To top it off, it's obvious to see where she gets her flaky attitude from...her mother REFUSES to answer my phone calls or emails. So here I am reddit, living with a girl who labels her food in the fridge so I don't touch it, and for the sake of keeping the peace...I am down to begging for a pizza X(.  I would prefer giftcards, because I would rather give out my email address than my physical address, but I will understand those who dont want to in case they believe I am a scammer.
