I lost my job last week and I've been getting by with cups of noodles and tuna and rice for the past few days, I'd really appreciate a real meal. My roommate's gone this weekend so this would be able to feed me for the next couple days. 

I'm sure people frequently say ""Oooh get me pizza and I'll get you back sometime pinky promise"" and then never cash in on that promise. Well I won't lie. I'm pretty broke, and until August when new job starts, I can't promise I'll get you guys back. So no empty promises for now. But I can tell you guys I'm hungry and broke, and it would be amazing if any of you could help me. 

Thank You","Hey guys, Philly redditor here. I lost my job last week and I've been getting by with cups of noodles and tuna and rice for the past few days, I'd really appreciate a real meal. My roommate's gone this weekend so this would be able to feed me for the next couple days.

My mother was not okay with it. According to her now, i am disowned from the family, and can no longer speak to her, unless i say i am deciding to not transition.

My dad's reaction was so misinformed that i inadvertently lost my cool trying to explain it, where i was then met with a stern 'Get out until you figure out that you're not a tra*ny'. 

My Mormon Grandad however, was not hostile, was not disagreeing, but merely said, ""Whilst i do not understand it, i'm sure you can help me find out."" He accepts what i'm doing and will not hold it against me, and will not treat me differently until i ask. 

I think i figured out where i'm staying for the next few years whilst i finally start on my path to feeling better in myself.

does anyone wanna help round off one of my most difficult days ever, and buy me a pizza? It would seriously help me to calm down and take my mind off the massive dilemmas that have happened.
